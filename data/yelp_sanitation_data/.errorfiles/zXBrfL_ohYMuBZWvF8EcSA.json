No wonder vegetarian food has a bad name. We visited this location twice, the first time I left reasonably happy due to the complimentary chocolate-covered strawberries,  friendly staff, and fresh, vibrant produce. I appreciated the build-my-own salad, but got a bit frustrated when I was told 'no substitutions' on the sandwiches.  I fail to understand why I can't modify the ingredients on a sandwich that is being made fresh in front of me??  Enough! I no longer see the real upside to Cafe Zupa.  I won't avoid it but won't make a point to go back.

I think of CZ as a step below Panera Bread.You roll the dice on if there is going to be a long line and crowded tables depending on what time of the day you go.  The line usually moves rather quickly, but almost so fast that most employees don't spend much time even really acknowledging you because they are busy prepping your food. There are a few dessert options to choose from if the chocolate dipped strawberry you get as a complimentary snack is not enough. I don't think the extra slice of bread that they give you is even necessary, but it is good to use as a scoop for your soup. I've never had an issue or concern about the preparation and or freshness of the food. The soups are usually overly salty for me, but that just my preference.  There is an employee who works in the dining area and helps keep the tables and drink station clean which is great with the cafeteria style atmosphere that CZ offers.", "Date": "2016-01-09", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Heather", "ReviewID": "a3OyHit4SyyutvLLBtVtTg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Great food.

The Try 2 combo for $8 is probably your best bet with a choice of a full sandwich, a full salad, or a bowl (not cup) of soup. They have a big menu of options, or you can build your own (at least for the salads - maybe not the sandwiches). I've had about four different sandwiches, two salads, and tried four or five soups. It's all CRAZY good, and filling.  Along with your order, you get a piece of french bread and a chocolate covered strawberry. LOVE IT. They have desserts, too, and they are also super good. The salted caramel creme brulee is my favorite, and it's good to combine with a brownie (ultimate fat kid status right here). Even the drink bar has flavored syrups to jazz up your soda or tea.   On top of high quality, tasty food, the staff is really friendly. They're so nice, they make In & Out employees look like jerks, which says a lot.

The two girls at the register were talking about their personal lives loud enough for everyone in line to hear, which seemed unprofessional.   The big issue I had was with the food. I got an Asian salad & a lobster soup. The salad barely had any meat & the soup tasted a little off. Hours later I started feeling sick & then the next morning I spent a good 24 hours puking & having other bodily fluid issues.

The mushroom soup, for example, is a bowl of cream. Perhaps if you are lucky they'll actually give you a single mushroom.

He wasn't a fan of that either. It has other veggies in it too. But he said there was just too many  flavors in it. A lot  going on in it. He prefers his tomato soup to have more of a tamato flavor.

It was just a clustered mess, no one knew who had what and they skipped right over my sister for soup. They were assembling our trays and asked if it was correct, which seemed so but we were being rushed. The host did not read back our orders and on our side all we could see was drink orders and the combo of 2 salads and soups plus they charged us for goat cheese that they placed without asking, luckily they put it only on one of our soups and my sister and I switched. However, after we got situated at the table they brought over another sandwich and it confused us because none of us ordered sandwiches. My mom took a look at her receipt and of course we were charged for two extra sandwiches. Which seemed familiar to me because the two ladies in front of us ordered those sandwiches.   Also, when the host went to hand my mother the pen to sign the receipt it fell into her soup and of course my mom asked for a replacement and when the host told them she needed a new one they asked why. She says  she dropped the pen in her soup.  Well, that goes both ways, first you shouldn't be handing pens over any food which causes contamination. Two, dont immediately go blaming the customer, they is offensive.   Remind you we were being rushed and asked if it looked correct and the host did not read our order aloud.   My mom goes to the counter to ask about it and to tell them we got sandwiches we didn't order and she had paid for. The manager or shift leader says  well didn't I ask if the order was correct when you were up here.   At this point, I got upset because my mom looked upset and it's our last day here visiting. He wouldn't take just one moment to listen to her and try to solve a problem. And instead we wasted food that we didn't order but paid for.

A little over one week new to the area and the word is out!   I have read the great reviews from the one they opened in the Henderson area and was eager to try this place out.    As we walked in everything was a little overwhelming at first.  Since it is new they had greeters at the front ready to explain their concept and how it all works.  Its all pretty simple - Salad, Soup and/or Sandwich.  A combo includes your choice of 2 for $7.99.  This is similar to the Chipotle style assembly line thing where you tell the servers what you want and they will assemble what you choose.  There is an assorted number of fresh toppings to choose from-meats, cheeses, veges, pastas, nuts, fruits, croutons etc. Better ingredients than any salad bar I've ever been to.  They had a wide range of dressings as well as many fat free and low fat choices which I thought was fantastic!  So you can opt for their salads choices or you can build your own.  If you build your own salad they give your choice of 6 ingredients. You can also choose to add toppings to your soup for $.59.  They have many sandwiches to choose from.  The Ciabatta bread they use is fresh, soft and airy.    Here's a rundown of what we ordered:  *Asian BBQ Pork sandwich - Very flavorful - BBQ sauce was tasty *Salad (create your own). Romaine with Sesame Ginger dressing (fat free & amazing flavor), chicken, ground cashews, feta, apples and croutons - this was my favorite overall *The Italian sandwich - BF really liked the flavor and balsamic spread it had *Roasted Red Pepper Lobster Bisque - was amazing with a little kick and lobster flakey chunks to compliment (I've been to steak houses that don't have this much lobster)  Each combo came with bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry.  The drink section has your choices of  syrups  to add to your soda.  Recommended recipes are written on the drink cups to give you an idea of how it works.  My BF did the  rootbeer float  mixture - 2 squirts of vanilla to your rootbeer.  It was very tasty and was exactly to be expected.  I forgot to mention that had some amazing looking desserts but it was already enough food.  Maybe desserts to-go next time.  BTW you can get any of the food to-go.  The customer service was great.  We were nicely greeted by everyone we came in contact with.  Since its new everyone was on their A game and happy to be there.  I hope that continues.  The place was very clean (new still) and you can tell they spent a lot of time and money on the bright and vibrant décor inside and out.  Its very modern and open with plenty of seating.  They have the recharge bar-but I have no idea what that was about yet.  As we were indulging in our new found favorite food stop we were already planning on coming back the next day.

When you ask for more they charge you or use another of your 6 inclusive toppings scoops. The prices were decent for the portions. Service wasn't memorable, which is to be expected at $10 a plate. Probly won't return, considering the all you can eat salad bar at sweet tomatoes is relatively commensurate as far as produce quality, yet boasts more options. The one vegan Soup was great, a little salty, but not unbearable. The wilted and soggy lettuce was a bit of a turn off, but too insignificant to warrant complaining.

When I get back, a girl with dark braids and glasses goes  are you here for the dressing?   and I say  yeah for the spinach salad? Thank you  and she hands it to me. That's it. No sorry, you're welcome, or sorry for the inconvenience. Literally silence. As if that's not upsetting enough, I come home again to realize that my fresh herb chicken is actually pesto chicken instead. I'd call back, but it doesn't seem like they care about messing up their customer's order. Will never be returning.

Soup is ridiculously overpriced and not that great at $6 for a bowl.  They offer syrups with the soda machine, but good luck making an italian soda because they won't give you half and half. I want to be clear, it's not that they don't have half and half, they do (I saw 6 gallons in the kitchen just from where I was standing in line) and they will not give it to you at any price. If they are unwilling to provide something so simple as a mere ounce of half and half when they have plenty, you can only imagine what else they won't do. I offered to pay for it and they still said I can't have any. They had the gall to suggest I should bring my own. Cause I've always wanted to be carrying around all the condiments I might need for the day. I've been trying to talk to somebody about this, but their management is impossible to reach.  I just can't believe a company would spend so much money on marketing and then be completely unwilling to address a customer's concerns.   So go ahead and try cafe zupas, and if you like it exactly how they serve it, good for you. Good luck if you want it  your way,  their attitude is  eff you, go to Burger King.

We were lured here with the mailers and promise of 50% off the entire check.  We had the crab soup, clam chowder, and tomato soup.  All were spot-on with flavors and not overly salty or watered down.  The Asian pork sandwich was a winner.  It had a hint of heat and the cilantro really brightened up the sandwich.  The Thai sandwich and the crab avocado were adequate and not terribly special.    We loved the idea of flavoring your own drinks with the syrups they had at the drink station but noticed you need a lot of squirts to really flavor the tea.  I like the option, though.  The ice-makers were having a hard time keeping up with the crowd, which, I assume, were just kinks from opening days of service.  The staff was efficient and the management must be given kudos for moving the crowd along fairly quickly.  I don't suppose they will keep that many staff on hand in the coming weeks and months, so I will be curious to see if they can keep up with busy service.  I like that they have placards on the tables imploring customers to not save a seat as the tables turn over quickly.  Once you're done getting your food, it makes it easier to find a table fast.  This place was slightly cheaper than Panera but without the comfort of one.  Still, I've been a little annoyed with paying Panera prices lately, so this is quite a decent alternative.

The amount of sugar that is in the homemade dressings have a ton of sugar in it like about 6 cups of sugar for one batch on dressing that is sick no dressing should have that much in it, also all the salt in the soup is a extensive amount  which is not necessary. I ate only half a small bowl and I got so dizzy I felt so sick and I am a healthy person. They also have no calorie chart to count your intake of calories in each dish. The manager that I tried to talk to at this location was dismissive when I asked why is the soup so watery her responses was it was made this morning when I got there 12:34 PM. so giving any kind of constructive criticism wasn't in the cards. The manager's name is Alisha she was not only rude but rolled her eyes when talking to her in line. The other 2 employee's that I spoke to apologized for her actions. I told them that was not necessary that it was not there fault for her actions. I asked some employee's if they ate here at Zupas they said they will never eat the food because of how much sugar and salt was in it! Shame! They also said the manager there is always dismissive often and they have to work with a person like that and they said again sorry for her actions. They told me to contact district manager for her being that way. His name is Lyle. The only high light was I got to meet a news anchor from channel 8.  So if you want to eat healthy this is not the place for you SUGAR SUGAR SUGAR PLUS SALT SALT AND MORE SALT. NO CALORIE COUNTER CHART! If you need a sugar salt rush and want to feel like you want to die for that day ha-ha go here. Hope this is helpful to the wise. You would think it's healthy but after going to several Dr. office's on just normal visits they tell me they would never eat at this place. Just alone the amount of sugar in the dressing is so unhealthy... Followed by so much salt be wise and ask..

Once with my family, once with a friend, once alone and once with my sister. Every time I feel like I spent a bit too much. Also, I don't think I've ever left there feeling happy either. It's bright and noisy.  But then again, it is more of a family place.   They do have their non-negotiable menu. It's simple, it's pretty and everything sounds good. They have their set up assembly line style. Ordering is easy. If you have any troubles, the employees in line will throw out a suggestion or two. I've tried the Crab Avocado Melt, the Turkey Bacon Avocado (I think you can tell that I like avocado) and the Asian BBQ Pork. The Crab and the Turkey were pretty good (they're paninis) but the Asian BBQ Pork is sticky and kind of a pain to eat. It is good, but I'm better off buying a Bahn Mi. Bahn Mis are usually cheaper too. I haven't tried their salads. They didn't seem interesting enough for me. Their soups are never hot, they're always this awkward warm temperature. I'm not sure if they could microwave them, but if I'm paying $7.99 for soup and a sandwich, I'd expect the food to be adequate. I've tried the Lobster Bisque which isn't bad. I've also had their Swiss Onion Soup that's a temporary item. It was good. Another thing is that their soup station was messy. I saw the assembly food line workers chatting amongst themselves, so I'm pretty sure they had time to at least wipe it down.   With the $7.99 combo, it comes with a slice of cold bread loaf and a chocolate dipped strawberry. Sexy, huh? Yeah, I guess it could be sexy... Unless you think fruit bugs and leaves are sexy. (Not judging if you are!) The first issue I had with the strawberries is that there were leaves MELTED IN WITH THE CHOCOLATE. Honestly, how could you miss that?  How can you expect your customers to NOT notice it? Luckily that time, I brought it up and they switched it out. Easy. Done. I didn't even have to ask them to switch it out. Tonight was another story. After my sister ate her strawberries, she started freaking out because a bug that crawled out of the bag. It was a tiny bug. Like the kinds you find with the berries you didn't wash yet. First, I brought the bag to the cashier. I asked if they wash the berries or if they even inspect them or whatever. She's like,  Yeah, we wash them. Sorry about that.  in the most  omg, it's late and I just want to get out of here. It's not my fault you have issues.  attitude ever.  Didn't offer if I want to talk to the manager or anything. That was a problem for me. I'm like,  okay, thanks I guess.   I waited for a bit and waited until a busser came by. I told her what happened and she brought out Joe, the manager. Joe explained to me that it's corporate policy that the berries come pre-washed. He said the chocolate wouldn't stick to it otherwise. He then said they would keep an extra eye out when they inspect it in the morning. He offered another dessert or another strawberry, which was nice. We didn't take it, we were a bit grossed out by the bug.   Yeah, I can say (with a lot of confidence) that we won't be returning there. Ever. Not even if you paid for my meal. If I wanted soup or anything like what they have, Panera Bread is down the street and Sweet Tomatoes isn't far from there either.

The consistency of both soups are always perfect - thick, very luscious and creamy. They are also slightly sweet, richly decadent, packed with quality ingredients and incredible flavor.  On the other hand, I'm not too crazy about their sandwiches. I haven't found a sandwich that that blew away my tastebuds yet. Their sandwich options are unique, but they are also lacking the body of flavor and substance that would typically impress me - they are all so dry and bland.  SOUPS: - Lobster Bisque - I am seriously addicted to this soup! Plus, I love the generous chunks of vegetables swimming in the soup, it makes for a satisfying and comforting meal in itself. 5/5 - Wild mushroom bisque - This is another winning soup. The wild mushroom flavor is extremely complex and savory. You can really taste the earthiness and nuttiness of the wild mushrooms in every sip. 5/5 - Tomato bisque - Slightly tart, slightly sweet and very comforting. This is a great choice with grilled cheese. 4/5  SANDWICHES:  - Honey Cilantro Carnitas - the pulled pork was moist, but it is also pretty bland and not seasoned properly. Also, the honey cilantro glaze sounds amazing, but it didn't have a pleasant taste to it - it tasted like processed ingredients and chemicals (even though they advertised it to be  house-made ) The sandwich filling: cabbage, non-existent pickled red onion and bread were also very dry and not memorable. 3/5 - BBQ Pulled Pork - they used the same pulled pork as in the carnitas sandwich above - so the meat was moist, but bland. I also wasn't a fan of the BBQ sauce that they used. The sauce didn't have any bold, sweet, or tangy flavor - it was too basic and generic. The overall filling and flavor was very dry and boring. 2/5 - Pesto Chicken Panini - the pesto flavor was extremely weak and the chicken was very plain. The overall panini was dry and bland. 2/5 - Crab Avocado Melt Panini - my boyfriend enjoyed this one the most. The crab flavor isn't strong, possibly because they used imitation crab? But the avocado made the sandwich creamy and the bacon added a necessary saltiness. 3/5  This is a dependable lunch spot and I hope I find a sandwich I'm crazy about soon.

The crab avacado melt had the potential to be very good, I mean crab and avacado how can you go wrong, but the bacon overpowered the delicate flavor of the crab.

They screwed up two out of the four kids meals and one had to wait for her food for nearly ten minutes after we had started eating. The staff seemed overwhelmed and let other people through the line in front of us. Also, the staff were getting after each other because there were a couple of other large groups all together and orders weren't being put together correctly. I hate to see this kind of stuff going on when I am out to dinner.  The Food: To me, most of the soups taste similarly....not like they are bad, but it really seems like they are all based on the same cream base with just a different theme. Also, the salads all seem very similar. Greens, berries, nuts, etc-just different nationalities assigned to each one. Not bad at all, but they are all just different green salads. Sandwiches: The first time I went there (sans kids) I got a pesto chicken panini and it was good-that's it.  There are a lot of problems with the ordering line. Just getting through the hassle of the line is bad enough, but my kids' food was not right (I think they actually screwed up my order about five different ways), they added some else's order to my bill and then some lady came up to the register and totally interrupted", "Date": "2014-02-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Christie", "ReviewID": "qfj71H7XGgoEKVJfAWuKXA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I attempted Cafe Zupas on opening day and the line was so long out the door that I decided to wait. It was worth it! Cafe Zupas is kind of like Panera Bread, serving sandwiches, soups, salads and bakery stuff. The only thing different is Cafe Zupas is much fresher and tastier!   When you first walk in they have large easy to read menu boards. You place your order telling them what you want on what, pay for your food and find a table where your food is brought out to you. They have a pretty good amount of seating offering tables as well booths.   Sandwiches by themselves are $4.99 each, salads by themselves are $4.99 for the half size and $6.99 for the large size, soups are $3.99 for the half size and $5.99 for the large size.  There is a   Try 2 Combo  priced at $7.99 where you can pick from two of the following: - Whole Sandwich - Half Soup - Half Salad   I ordered the  Honey Bacon Club  and  Summer Chicken Salad  from the try 2 combo. The portion size was great. The honey bacon club is a grilled panini with turkey, ham, bacon, tomatoes, muenster cheese and honey mustard. So good! I will order this one again for sure. The summer chicken salad has chicken, fresh strawberries, cashews, dried cranberries, grapes, mixed greens and strawberry vinaigrette dressing. The salad tasted to fresh and yummy! They have over a dozen salads to choose from so there is a nice variety to choose from each time. A really nice touch was the chocolate covered strawberry that came complimentary with my meal! Hubby got one with his too! Hubby ordered a  Wisconsin Cauliflower Soup  that was put of this world delicious! I ended up getting a spoon and sharing it with him it was just so good. The soup is whole heads of cauliflower blended together with cheddar and pepper jack cheese. Bacon was added for an additional 59 cents. Fresh bread also comes with the meal so it was nice to dip in the soup!  So I saw a dessert in the case that called my name. It was the  Sinful 7 Chocolate Cake  priced at $4.49 and I got it to-go. This cake is any true chocolate lovers dream come true! It lives up to it's name and is sinfully good.  The drink bar offers 16 different fountain drinks with free Italian Soda flavorings. If you have a device that needs some juice then you can take advantage if the recharge bar. They do offer catering, but if they offer online ordering I didn't see anything about it. There is a sign that says they do not take tips, but will gladly clean up your dishes (yep they use real dishes) and table when you are finished.

I told the wifey & kids,  I know where we're going this weekend for a cheap lunch!   And that was that.  Upon arriving at the new Cafe Zupas location (next to that yummy Pinkbox Donuts), imagine my surprise...BUSY!  PACKED!  Line out the friggin' door and almost around the building.  Come on Zupas....thought that flyer was only meant for ME!?  Apparently not.  Half of Las Vegas was at Zupas on this lovely afternoon.  Probably waiting in anticipation for me to arrive.  But most likely not.  But...maybe.  Cafe Zupas serves house-made soups, salads, and sandwiches.  I do like me a good sandwich.  This Utah chain boasts good food at good prices.  I'm happy to say the prices for their eats are more reasonable than aforementioned places like Panera Bread (got I hate going there for the mere fact everything is overpriced), and the now closed Atlanta Bread Company (which I kinda liked).  You know me, if it's cheap then I'm down.  But it's gotta taste at least somewhat good.  The line for the day was long, but it went rather quickly.  Cafe Zupas is kinda like a cafeteria, order on down the line, pay at the end.  It was nice that everything looked fresh and not frozen, and your food wouldn't be made until you ordered it (unless it's a soup of course).  Very, very reasonable prices at Zupas, a large bowl of soup runs $6, a half order $4, sandwiches are $5 each, and salads run $7 for a large, a half for $5.  Desserts run for around $3 - $4 each, and there's a kid's meal combo for only $4.  But the best deal on the menu is probably the Try 2 Combo for $8, and you get two choices of soup & salad, salad & sandwich, or sandwich & soup.  Your selections can be from anything on the menu.  Very nice if this is your first time to Cafe Zupas, gives you some options to try a bit of everything.  This is what our family stuck with, four of the Try 2 Combos.  We had:  -New England Clam Chowder -Nuts About Berries Salad -MangoBerry Salad -Shanghai Chicken Salad -Crab Avocado Melt Panini -Asian BBQ Pork Sandwich -California Turkey Sandwich -Italian Club Sandwich  Food?  Not bad for a healthy lunch!  Salads were full of fresh fruits and veggies, especially the berry salad.  The crab panini was very good, grilled and gooey.  The big surprise though was the Asian BBQ pork sandwich, it tasted like a bahn mi!  If it was on French bread it would have been killer!  That is my main gripe about Cafe Zupas - no choice of bread.  All they have are ciabatta buns.  I love ciabatta buns but it depends what kind of filling is in between.  Ciabatta goes great with the Italian Club, the bun just sops up the fat lovely from meats like salami.  If Zupas had another choice of bread it would be stellar.  Maybe a ciabatta OR a French roll?  But I know you gotta keep food costs down.    Overall a great lunch.  Like how if you order soup you get a chunk of French bread for dipping, and with each order you get a chocolate covered strawberry.  Very chic, making me feel like I'm at some fancy bistro.  I did the corner of the vast array of hot sauces, I do enjoy a good kick!  I also like how Zupas serves Coca-Cola products!  Also very cool of them to have a section for Italian syrups so you can create your own Italian soda!  But guys, you need to have some cream or half & half on the side to complete this.  I got away super CHEAP for lunch on grand opening.  With the 50% off special, for our orders, drinks, and a little dessert, the tab was just over $20!  We had some leftovers for later too.  That's cheaper than going to the local Buffet @ Asia.  Just too bad the 50% off wasn't everyday!  Not a bad deal even at regular price for this type of food and atmosphere.  Workers were very friendly and helpful, even on a super busy grand opening day.

The employees across the counter were either not speaking loud enough, or I'm going deaf. They also talked very quickly and I had to ask them to repeat things several times. Also, a small observation for the management. There was a Zupas employee standing at the entrance of the ordering line holding menus. We approached her and assumed she would give us a menu or answer questions. Instead, she instructed us to walk around her and did not offer a menu. There was no one else in line but she wanted us to walk thru the pylons that form the ordering line. It was odd because the employee served absolutely no purpose that I can determine.  After ordering, I went to the restroom and discovered that the low-water use faucet is prone to splash off the sink and got my crotch area nice and wet. So now I've got to walk out with looking like I peed myself a bit.   I had a cobb salad with chicken that was pretty good and a cauliflower soup that was very good.

On first glance it might seem just like Panera but as the folks at Cafe Zupas will tell you, everything made fresh, including the soups which are made from scratch on the premises daily. The food is a step up from the majority of fast-casual eateries. The Asian BBQ pork sandwich is reminiscent of a banh mi with its flavors and the size is great for the price ($7.99 for a whole sandwich and small soup combo). The lobster bisque was full of potatoes, vegetables, and other goodness but lacked lobster. I only counted two or three small chunks.  The kid's menu was disappointing. While my kid liked the chicken strips (2 per order), they were rather small and unimpressive looking. The kid's meal requires them to choose 2 of the four options (chicken strips, soup, grilled cheese, or fruit) but they're not allowed to double up on a single item (like 2 orders of chicken). My kid didn't like the texture of the bread for the grilled cheese and I knew he wouldn't touch the soup or fruit. So, on future visits it looks like he'll only eat half of what we pay for.   Desserts were highlights of the meal. The chocolate cake was plenty rich and we loved the different layers and textures of cream, cake, fudge, and crust. The chocolate hazelnut creme brulee was more like a pudding with it's creamy texture, but was good nonetheless. Each meal also comes with a chocolate covered strawberry.  Prices are reasonable and the staff was friendly and informative.

Two stars for lack of availability of nutritional information- from a widespread chain that should have this information readily available.  I'm on a health kick and have had this place bookmarked for a while. This location is close to my work, and I viewed their online menu to make my selections prior to going. I track calories and ran into extreme difficulty trying to get any info at all on this- none on their company website, a few dishes with info around the web, but all with unusually high numbers considering the dish descriptions.  Ultimately opted for the crab avocado melt sandwich combo with the cup of mushroom bisque- love how you can sample soups before ordering. Considering I got info that the particular sandwich was nearly 900 calories, I only ate half. Appreciated the gesture of including a slice of bread and a chocolate-dipped strawberry dessert with my combo, which was well-priced at under $9 with tax and did not ask for a tip on the receipt.  Food was tasty, but sandwich was underwhelming considering the calories I was lead to believe I was  paying  for it. Soup was damn delicious though. Would go back for a soup and salad combo.

It was tough to do because I enjoy the combos of soups, sandwiches, and salads so much at Panera that it was hard for me to picture anything being better.   Well that and the fact that if I greeted her with another cafe's breadcrumbs on my face and my odor being that of Wisconsin Cauliflower soup, well she might not ever take me back.  The decor and ambiance were pretty lacking here in my opinion, and it didn't scream warm and inviting in the least, but rather cold and factory like.  A helpful employee instructed myself and a coworker on the ordering process and we went down the assembly line making our choices.   I found it a little chaotic as a first-timer but I'm sure it would improve with each visit and especially once you find that sweet spot of your favorite order.  An example of the chaos was that by the time we reached the cashier, my friend was in front and only half his order was on his tray, while mine was behind his fully completed.  The staff did a great job in getting it all straightened out and perhaps there wasnt an issue to begin with, but I prefer a seamless ordering experience and felt this one was slightly rushed and not as anal as I might like.   Patient, warm and anal is perfection for me in a cafe.   Get your mind out the gutter.     For food I went with the Tuscan White Bean and Veggie soup and the Thai Peanut Chicken sandwich.  I wasnt into the soup at all.   It just seemed flat and lifeless, though I should have probably realized that from the description on the website:   A light, vegetarian soup loaded with lots of vegetables & delicious white beans.    Why did I even order this is a question I cannot answer at the moment.  It also wasn't as hot as I like my soup to be.   Would not recommend that.   The sandwich was good.  It had a nice balance of sweet and tangy from the Peanut and Chili sauces, and the chicken tasted fresh and had a nice flavor.  The crunch from the cucumbers and pickled carrots was also welcome and slowly helped me forget how bad the soup was.  Overall it was a decent experience and meal, especially considering the price $7.99 for the sandwich and a half soup/salad.

The husband was in a sandwich mood, while I was in the please do not drive any more further mood, which made Cafe Zupas our lunch spot. I've been wanting to come here for all the years we've had to pass it on a weekly basis. We entered and there was no line, hallelujuer. We took the time to stare at the menu, but didn't take too much time as we quickly knew were going to have their pick 2 combo. You choose 2 between their salads, sandwiches, and soups. We both opted for soup and a sandwich.   I got the vegetarian sandwich when I really meant to order their chicken pesto, but I was torn and by the time i ordered...vegetarian sandwich just vomited out my mouth. Doh! I wasn't bummed or anything because the sandwich itself was as good as a sandwich with cucumbers, tomatoes, sprouts, greens, red peppers, muenster cheese, with red pepper hummus smeared inside could possibly be. No sarcasm, seriously.   Lover man got the Cuban grilled pork panini. He took a bite and pointed at it as he chewed, nodded his head with the hell yeah that's good in silent film tone. I wouldn't know because I declined his offer to try. He couldn't finish the other half to his sandwich, so when the kids got home...they were fighting over it. Apparently it was pretty good.   Nevermind the touchscreen charging station, or the spacious and clean dining area, rolling and working highchairs, extremely friendly and helpful staff, touchscreen coca cola drink machine thingy, the free chocolate covered strawberry you get with each meal and bread...but that cauliflower soup was my yumgasm of the day!  They ask if you want bacon and/or cheese topped onto your soup...i skip the bacon and opted for the cheese. The heat of the soup melted that cheese into a gooey compliment. Sure there were a time or two the cheese kinda got caught.up on my chin, snagged on my tonsils...but hey...nothing I couldn't handle. Lol. But, it was so good! I literally have tried recreating it at home two times since last week. If you don't find cauliflower purposeful so you don't bother consuming it...cauliflower has lots of vitamins in it so while the soup isn't the healthiest form to consume it, CONSUME IT! Dip that free bread all up in it is you want. I didnt, but if I didn't all ready have a sandwich I wouldve. The husband ordered their clam chowder. He didn't say anything. Probably because after tasting my soup it shut his clam chowder down. Lol.  I love that everything is house-made, and locally or sourced nearby. It really makes a difference. 8.99 for the pick2. You can easily spend the same.or less and get a plate lunch/dinner...so it really is up to you and your mood as to how you want to spend your 9 bucks.

The hubs dragged me here to try out this joint.  We each ordered a combo - I ordered the Chinese chicken salad with tomato soup and the hubs ordered a half sammy with the cream of mushroom soup. Each combo comes with a huge hunk of generic tasting sourdough bread that is pretty unappetizing and stone cold. Oyster crackers are available for the soup.   My Chinese chicken salad tasted alright - it wasn't anything special. They were really light on the amount of protein served in this chicken salad. I tried the tomato soup which was really really sweet. I don't think I would order that again.  The hubs ordered the Asian BBQ pork sandwich which was again too sweet and overly sauced. The filling is minimal and the bread is really nothing special. I kind of don't like the bread - the weird overly doughy firm bread is not to my taste. Call me crazy but I think I prefer the yoga-mat chemical laced Subway bread better than the bread they use here. It really isn't all that.  I think the chocolate strawberry was the best thing that came with our meals.  The cool thing that they do have here is the different Italian syrups in their beverage station so you can customize your drink into something new. That is really cool.

Felt like an icebox lol Also, who doesn't love chocolate covered strawberries and a slice of bread? Complementary with your meal!

This location is closer to me but I'm visited the eastern location plenty of time. Both locations offer superb customer service and great tasting, fresh food. It's like a Panera bread but better due to their better quality food, better tasting flavor, bigger portion sizes, and affordable pricing. Every staff member you come across is so friendly and their restaurant is always clean. My 8 yr. old loves eating here as well, especially because of their complimentary chocolate-covered strawberry with every meal and yummy tasting desserts. Plus they have internet access and charging stations! Give this place a try! You won't regret it.", "Date": "2014-04-21", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Lyssa", "ReviewID": "eKQzsKSS8XpSKEkQWekFwA", "Overall": "3", "Content": "My sister & I had both been wanting to trying this place out for awhile. There was alot to choose from off the menu than I expected. I ordered the veggie sandwich & the mangoberry salad. Both were very good.  The one thing that turned off our experience was the CUSTOMER SERVICE,- okay let me just say that customer service is very important, if your customer service is poor, there is a risk in revenue for the company. With that being said, i was soooooo disappointed. One of the girls was very rude and i had to explain to each one (more than once) what i had ordered, the girl that was rude to begin with kept questioning what I ordered, as if i was making it up or something,  are you suuure you ordered that and not this?  once I had explained to her that  yes, it was what I ordered . I had to explain AGAIN what I ordered to the other girl.  I was irritated after that.   Would I go there again? Maybe at a different time of the day with different workers and see how it goes. Its a shame because the food was terrific, but again the service was ridiculous.", "Date": "2015-03-25", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Crystal", "ReviewID": "SmmWqtSInd_SPLeGdlex1Q", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I love that Zupas is made fresh!  I'm perfectly content eating a salad with a sandwich or soup or both!  It's convenient and extremely good.

The staff wasn't professional and didn't know what was in some of the food. They didn't even know what anyone got and asked every customer to repeat what they had ordered. It wasn't even busy enough to forget the orders. They need a better system because it's clearly not working. My salad was also very dead and not fresh at all.", "Date": "2015-09-24", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Zachary", "ReviewID": "kkKUEm_t37oZZPxHVCJlKQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "This place is amazing.

The food was good but not the service. I was asked at least twice if someone else's order was mine. They did not have the chocolate covered strawberry and were offering a chocolate covered oreo. I asked the one girl if I could have bread instead and she agreed. The cashier said you do not get bread with a sandwich and tossed my bread back into the basked and I tried to explain and she said there was a charge for bread. I passed. I think in the future I will just go to the one in Henderson.", "Date": "2015-12-03", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
