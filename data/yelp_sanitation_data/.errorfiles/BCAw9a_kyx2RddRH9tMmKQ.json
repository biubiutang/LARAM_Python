The first visit was my first morning here I sat at the counter and ordered 2 eggs sunny side up with bacon and hash browns. The rye bread was a marble rye and served with an assortment of jellies and butter. I asked the server why two prices for everything on the menu. He told me if I go to the cash office in the casino they will give me a card for free and I can collect points as well as get discounts. So while my breakfast was cooking I ran over to get the card.   My breakfast came up quickly and was delicious. Especially the hash browns cooked to perfection and seasoned just right. This was a 5. However my last morning here I came with my husband we were in a rush I ordered the french toast my favorite that was coated in corn flakes. It was awful the only thing that helped was lots of syrup. My husband had the croissant breakfast sandwich. Breakfast with tip and discount card was expensive at nearly $50.

To prepare we asked all our friends for deals they had come by and interesting places to go. One of our friends gave us the heads up on this place and a secret dish that isn't on the menu. It's a big slab of steak, 3 grilled shrimp, big portion of mash potatoes and a side salad for $7.77(not bad). Other than this deal the food is pretty decently priced if you were looking for something a little different. The service really wasn't all that great, I think we saw our waiter 4 times from beginning till end. Just to take our order, bring the drinks, bring the food and bring the check. For something that was a restaurant inside a famous hard rock hotel, I was a little disappointed.   The food was mixer between alright and good. The steak was a cheap cut, but still very tender and good. The only real problem I had was the mashed potatoes. They seemed fake and a little watery. I mean it is a large amount of food for 8 bucks, but then again this is Vegas. What happened to the crazy buffets for 5 bucks. It was a good cheap way to bring in our first night out, but I think next time I'll try to bring a little more cash.", "Date": "2010-10-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "t_nDkXPJaCYHpwyYsLsUJg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I'm not one for giving 5 stars, but this place is great.

But c'mon, you gotta do some research to find the path of least resistance. So here's the advice on that path for Mr. Lucky's. Use your casino card to get off-the-menu steak and shrimp for 7.77, must order a drink with it. Sit at the counter to get the best service, watch when your food comes up, and get it hot and fresh. Don't be afraid to send it back if not cooked right. The shrimp was delicious tonight, buttery light charred garlic herb outside and moist tenderness inside. I had to send the steak back because it wasn't cooked as specified and a really tough cut of beef. They corrected it quickly and replaced the first 3 shrimp that I already ate, awesome! It was cooked perfectly the second time. Our server, Niki, was pleasant, made good suggestions, and didn't get flustered although she was slammed. Even the green beans were tasty enough to finish off, garlic and butter seared. This place is good but they will tend to understaff it to cut costs.

I asked the waitress if their prime rib was good before ordering it, she lied.  It was the worst piece of beef I had ever received eating out, anywhere.  I've had better prime rib at local greasy spoon diners.  It was tough, and flavorless.  Even the mashed potatoes were trash.  Who screws up mashed potatoes?

You'd figure, if you're inside a major casino that your food would be worthy of it.  Sadly this is not the case.

The seasoning on the breading was weak.  The hashbrowns were tasteless.  Everything was also fairly overpriced for the lack of flavor impact.

So I decided to drive down there from Summerlin. When I arrived the same woman said that this special was only on Saturday and Sunday. She claimed that she there was a steak and shrimp special everyday from 2-8. It's quite amusing/unbelievable to confuse ayce prime rib with steak an shrimp. SAD!!!

I've stayed at the HRH tower before, so being so close by and staying a few days in town, we had to eat here at least once!  The decor is pretty nice! They have a rather large space and can accommodate quite a bit of people at any given time. Prices here aren't bad. The breakfast here isn't to die for but it isn't bad either. I've had the chance to eat breakfast food and also things like the chicken soup.   Overall it's a place to check out if you're staying at this hotel. I can't ever think of any good places to catch a breakfast so late and this place definitely comes in handy on my Vegas trips. I hope they've bumped up their customer service since  I was last here in Feb. It was the worst! My waiter not only forgot our drinks, neglected our table, and did nothing but talk to other workers, laugh around, and talk to what looked like customers that were just standing around waiting for who knows what. When those people left, our waiter still took his time getting our meals that were already plated for a while.

Value and quality has certainly dropped since I began going to Mr Lucky's in '96 when the steak and shrimp special was $5.95 and you weren't required to purchase a beverage and included a salad. The lemonade back in those days used fresh squeezed lemons not the powdered/concentrated crap they use now.  These days, you can still find the off the menu steak and shrimp special (show your players card to get the deal), but for $7.77 minus the salad (really? how much money did you save by taking off the salad?!) and you are required to purchase a drink ($3 for a soda/tea/lemonade) so in reality, your special is not so special at $10.77. The steak, I believe has also shrunk in size since the special began. The two things that remain awesome is the grilled shrimp and the garlic mashed potatoes.   Service, even sitting at the counter is spotty at best.   If you happened to look at the menu for other food, it includes overpriced breakfasts and other items.   I guess if you are starving at 3-4 am, drunk, and don't want to stumble anywhere else outside of the casino, this will fit the bill, but I won't be rushing back here anytime soon. Instead, I will head over to Eillis Island for the steak, potato and beer special (which includes a salad!)", "Date": "2014-11-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Amanda", "ReviewID": "6tvvs4ilIDGtSXtNQAPwOA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "They are getting 5 stars for the veggie burger.

GJ Yelp :)   My wife and I had just gotten out of an MMA competition and were STARVING! Of course, I jumped on the Yelp app, which lead us to  Mr. Luckys . I glanced through some  Tips  and saw that they have a $7.77 gamblers deal, which was off the menu, and sounded great. After we were seated, our waitress came over, took our drink order and asked if we had any questions. She told me I had to have a players  Backstage Pass  to get the $7.77 deal, and directed me towards the players reward desk. She was nice enough to put the order in while I went and picked up my card.   My wife and I ordered the  Chicken Nachos (refer to pic) to start. They were good. The cheese, which was smothered throughout, was gooey, deliciousness. The nachos weren't amazing, but they were very good and they were served on a hot skillet. Pretty cool presentation for sure. The $7.77 special(refer to pic) came with a salad, (looked like) 8oz Strip Steak topped with 3 grilled shrimp, and mashed potatoes. It was rather large for the price, and extremely tasty as well. My steak was cooked to a perfect medium. It was very juicy and flavorful. The shrimp, on the othe hand, were rubbery, and I actually forgot they were on the plate until I looked back at the picture I took. My wife ordered a bacon cheese burger, which she thought was good, but nothing special.   The restaurant started to become packed, so we didn't want to keep the booth occupied for any longer. The waitress, even though she was noticeably busy, was still on point, and got us out the door in no time.

I tried to come here once around 1am or 2am and the line was prohibitively long so I just haven't had the chance to try it out.  Lucky for me (see what I did there), I had a meeting at Hard Rock this week, and it turned into a breakfast meeting.  I generally dont eat breakfast during the week, so this was a rare occasion for me.  I tend to save my breakfasts for brunch or when family is in town.  My plate of Huevos Rancheros would definitely fit the bill for either one of those occasions.  The tortillas underneath were crisp and the beans weren't mushy.  The ranchero sauce was chunky and spicy.  The best part is that there wasn't an oily layer of cheese like you'll find at Egg Works.  All in all, this was a pretty damn good plate of food.  I came here recently for a breakfast meeting, so keep in mind that I wasn't necessarily paying attention to the service or the attentiveness of our server.  She did leave a pot of coffee on the table for us, and I do recall her checking in at least twice - but we had a computer out and it was pretty apparent that we didn't need anything else so I won't say it was any reflection on her.  I'm only giving this three stars, however, because the prices are a little steep - bordering on room service prices.  I understand that this is a casino diner, but it's still a diner (and it's not like this is Center Strip).  Their standard breakfast of three eggs, hash browns, and a meat runs $15, and a short stack of pancakes is $10.   Pricing aside, I'll definitely come here again.

Didn't go well with the dried out shrimp roll, but then again what does?  The burger was ok, but it was just a burger. Plain patty on a generic roll.

Once we ordered, the wait was long, but not unusual in a late-night casino joint. However, the problem came once we got our food, which was subpar in general, and mediocre at best. For instance, I got the Southern Burger, and the burger patty was barely visible between the Texas toast slices. A friend ordered the mac and cheese and prime rib. The only cheese flavor only came from the box of cheese nips crushed up on top, and what was supposed to be a medium-rare prime rib was only slightly cooked past blue-rare.

Hard Rock Hotel guests make the most of the space for their hangover breakfast woes, late night munchies, and room service deliveries.  However, the food is good enough to warrant the trip from outsiders.  Of course my friend and I fell into the category of those seeking mid-afternoon hangover relief, so we joined the line waiting for a table at the casual American staple.  We were starving, so when the host asked us if we would be willing to take the two remaining seats at the counter, we jumped at the chance.  However, when we walked through the diner, we noticed several available tables.  We had been duped into the counter seats, but we wound up enjoying the kitchen view so it all worked out in the end.  I appropriately ordered the  Rehab  Breakfast, which included  scrambled egg whites with mushrooms, sauteed spinach, sliced vine-ripened tomatoes, and my choice of toast or English muffin.  My eggs were well-seasoned, and the balanced plate satisfied every inch of my weary palate.  A delicious glass of freshly-squeezed orange juice was also included, which provided the necessary dose of sugar to energize for an afternoon at the pool.  My friend's Smoked Atlantic Salmon plate included a crisply toasted bagel, red onions, capers, sliced tomatoes, and cream cheese.  The salmon slices were perfectly smoked and salted.

Now you need to have a player's card (one per table) from the Hard Rock to get the $7.77 deal and you must purchase a beverage, which brings the price to over $10 at the very minimum.  If you don't have a player's card or don't want to go get one (signing-up for one is free), the gambler's special is $10 plus the purchase of a beverage, which will bring your total to over $13 at the very minimum.

Many visitors are fans of the $7.77 steak and shrimp special or the $9.99 all you can eat prime rib.  Personally, I prefer to venture away from the specials here because there are so many gems tucked away throughout the offerings.  The Fire-roasted chicken nachos would be just another order of good chicken nachose except for the cheese sauce - in my lifetime i havent found a finer queso. Its heat comes from the fire-roasted peppers and its creaminess versus most heavier cheese sauces makes it a great appetizer (most nachos ruin the meal for me).  Dont hesitate to explore the apps - there's not a wrong call in the bunch and the diversity allows you to create some interesting sampler platters (build-your-own).  You cant go wrong with a burger or pizza, but I've found myself at Lucky's at 3am more often than not, so breakfast is usually my urge, and the all american breakfast plate always satisfies.  For the meat, request the apple chicken sausage and youll find out what makes this breakfast special versus so many in Vegas.  Finally, dont leave unless you order a coffee and chocolate shake (i usually order one with my drink to get an early start).  The service is almost always on point, but the Hard Rock gets busy a LOT so try not to go after shows, after the clubs let out, or on weekend nights if youre in any hurry.  Atmosphere-wise, there are a number of tvs over the diner counter, Americana,especially Vegas-themed, scattered about the walls, and the casino is right outside and open for you to watch the gamblin' fiends.  The price is casino-average, with most meals costing 10-15 each.  Last i checked, Lucky's is on restaurant.com and you can get a certificate for $25 off of $35.

Turns out she was Randi from www.savelv.com, which is a really great online resource for finding free and discounted things to do and eat around Las Vegas.  Aside from being a good resource for food deals, she also knew some interesting Vegas factoids (like that the tallest Christmas tree on display in the US was this year was a 109 footer at M Resort, north of the Strip).  Taking her advice on steak deals around town, our hero made a mental note of the off-menu special at Mr. Lucky's in the Hard Rock casino for the next morning.  The $7.77 secret special for an 8-oz. steak, mashed potatoes, and 3 shrimp on a skewer is a steal of a deal that's available 24/7.  It comes with a basic (but fresh and leafy) salad as well.  Our hero had his steak medium rare, and it was cooked to perfection with nice blackened criss-cross grill marks on it.  The cut of the steak was surprisingly good for the price and was very tender and moist.  Our hero's hungry and hungover cohorts ate it extra slow so that they could savor the juicy meat.  The mashed potatoes on the side were excellent and tasted very smooth and creamy.  Even if you aren't lucky at the tables, you can still get a lucky deal on a meal at the Hard Rock!

The lucky seven comes with 3 moderate sized succulent shrimps. The cut of the steak was fair for the price you pay. It is grilled to your preference, for me medium rare is the only way to go. My friend ordered her's medium well. The ice cream scoop of mashed potatoes were unremarkable, a little gravy could have helped. Also there's a salad that also accompanies.

The fresh squeezed OJ was excellent though.  2nd day I had the eggs over easy with hash browns and grilled ham.  The eggs were decent, but the hash browns had way too much butter (or margarine?), and the ham was well, ham, with grills marks to boot.  3rd day I had the chicken noodle soup, opting to avoid any more wasted calories at this joint.

He definitely was very considerate and patient, especially considering that it was around 6 am in the morning and that he had a few  knocked  out customers experiencing one of their worst hangovers ever (not me, I was one of the people taking care of them).  Anyways, we stopped by here because we met up at the wrong place (originally thought it was the Hard Rock Cafe). We decided to stay and eat here instead. Joey was very patient because around 1/2 the people were ready to order and a few weren't, so he made sure to come by and check every so often to take our orders. He supplied us with water to drink quickly (especially for those hung over).  I ordered the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK with HASHBROWNS, WHOLE WHEAT TOAST, and my EGGS OVER EASY. Mmmmm..... Three of my friends decided to order the SIRLOIN STEAK AND EGGS for $17.99, which truthfully, I thought was a little expensive. I think we came at the wrong time because I'm reading all these reviews about how the steak and eggs are no more than ten bucks? Ehh...   Anyways, another reason why our waiter was cool was he gave us updates on our plates, so that we weren't randomly sitting their waiting. When our dishes arrived, mine looked like heaven!!! I was so famished.   Man, a bite of that CHICKEN FRIED STEAK.... so delicious with the crispy, crunchy outside and the juicy inside all covered in a savory sauce. When my friends, the ones who ordered the steak and eggs, saw it, they regretted their order and wished they ordered the same dish as me. They were so jealous. My eggs were cooked over-easy just the way I ordered, which makes me very, very happy (I like dipping my toast in the yolk).   Furthermore, I'm a  Yay! I'm a fan  with this place becasue of their service. Joey was very considerate of my friends who were out of it and were trying their best to eat if they could. In the end, we asked for a couple of extra bags to bring in the car just in case.

I usually get a garden salad with ranch, a side of tator tots or fries, and the Mac n Cheese (which they literally change every time).

I recommend getting the short stack of pancakes since it's the same thing as the $12 order of pancakes on the menu.  I have also been to one of their group interviews for a server position here and the manager said they pride themselves on their excellent service.

It blows Carrow's $9.99 prime rib out of the water (yes, I go to Carrow's, it's a cheap and quick fix for prime rib cravings- don't judge me). My sister, who regulars the place for this special, explained that while the prime rib is ayce, the sides are not. Therefore, if you like sides, you should ration them out as long as you'll need them.   The sides weren't that special. Veggies, mostly- green beans and squash. However, the potatoes were heavenly.   I must add that my to-go portion was eaten without utensils as we failed to ask for them with our meal... still worth it.   My second trip was the night after as I was searching for a sandwich. The turkey club with chipotle mayo did the trick. It was topped off with a delicious apple pie that, for a crust person like me, didn't overload me with toppings.

I do feel the Steak special at Ellis Island Casino & Brewery (see my review for that) is a better deal for a little bit more $ but this wasn't bad.   The onion tower was huge but over priced.

My first and main incentive on eating at this place was to get a  Pass the Line  / VIP stamp to use at the hotel's big concert venue, The Joint. I consider myself to be a seasoned concert attendee in Las Vegas because I go to Vegas at least twice a year for shows. But it's only as of this recent visit that I've been told about about this Pass the Line VIP thing for the Joint. If you're familiar with this program at the House of Blues establishments, it's almost the same thing at the Joint where if you order an entree or spend a certain dollar amount (not just drinks), you can get in another line that gets you in the venue before the regular general admission line does.   So I find out this information about an hour and a half before doors are set to open and I run over to Lucky's, sit at the counter and tell them I'll need the cheapest, fastest meal I can get so I can have that Pass the Line stamp. Even though I sat at the counter thinking I'd get faster service, the wait for an available server must've been at least 8 minutes. When the server came by, he suggested the chicken tenders. The order came by surprisingly fast. But no amount of ranch or barbecue sauce could've helped those dry and rubbery chicken breast pieces. McDonalds chicken nuggets taste better than this crap. I ate at least two of the four pieces to try to get my money's worth, paid my meal, got my stamp and ran over to the VIP line at the Joint.   I should've left the Hard Rock as soon as the show was over but my feet and back were killing me. (How could you not  dance your heart out and lose your sh*t watching Arcade Fire?) I thought I'd give my feet a good rest before heading out again so I went to Lucky's one more time to see if they could redeem themselves. It was only 11 PM so I was an hour too early to get the steak and eggs. I went with the sliders because I didn't want a huge burger or sandwich and not that many places can mess up sliders, right? This was the worst set of hamburger sliders I've ever had. The buns were dry and seemed like they were days old. The meat was tasteless and too thin. I was annoyed the sliders didn't come with french fries, and after the server told me a side order of french fries was huge, I just went with hash browns. The hash browns were ok and that was the only part of my meal I enjoyed.   Mr. Lucky's 24-7, you are on my Las Vegas sh*tlist.

A group of 6 of us had gone on a Friday morning for breakfast. It took at least 10 minutes for them to even get waters out to our table, even longer for our actual beverages, and waiting for the food was a nightmare.  We waited roughly an hour for our food to even make an appearance; what appears to be the manager comes out with two of our dishes with no mention of an apology for the food being so late. About 10-15 minutes later, the rest of our food arrives, one meal of which was done incorrectly so we had to send it back. They were transitioning from breakfast to lunch and we saw people getting their lunch food during that hour we were waiting for our food, so it was extremely frustrating to see that.  The waiter, very nonchalantly and awkwardly, mentioned that our food took so long because sports were on tv. Not an apology, not an excuse. It's March Madness in fucking Vegas.

My mom described the steak as a poor man's steak, and both my husband and my dad complained that there was a lot of of chewy fatty parts in the steak as well. My mom loved the green beans and mashed potatoes, everyone else not so much. My husband said the shrimp was chewy and over-seasoned, probably to mask the poor quality of the shrimp. Most people who rave about the gambler's specials are intoxicated while consuming their meal, so there's that. 2/5   VEGGIE BURGER ($13.99): A veggie burger made out of lentils and nuts piqued my interest, but the burger ended up being completely boring, taste wise. It had far too few toppings and needed some zing! It definitely could have been spruced up by some greenery or color of any kind. 2/5  SERVICE: All of the food was served room temperature and took 30+ minutes to arrive.

This is strictly under the dietary restrictions that I have as a celiac. The restaraunt is convenient, service is relatively good, but extremely uneducated in regards to food allergies (I will go into further explanation).  After a week of coming here as I have been staying at the Hard Rock, I have been pondering where on earth I was afflicted with cross contamination. I have been enlightened today by my server (Marvin) who has gone above and beyond.  The menu has a few gluten free options... pancakes, Belgian waffles.... great, except I don't care to get fat on this trip, and well, those gluten free options are not dairy free. Little known fact (apparently), many people who suffer celiac disease cannot consume dairy..  I have learned how to piece together meals at restaraunts where the staff are not properly educated/aware/trained/give a shit  about food allergies, but I deal with it by asking questions and making myself knowledgeable of things I need to avoid. Despite my efforts to check what I could eat on the menu and  the reassurance of the staff (prior to Marvin) I have gotten sick and remained sick throughout most of my time here in Vegas. The culprit? The couple of times I ate hashbrowns and a salad where after consuming 2/3 rds of it, I found pieces of croutons.   If you peer at the menu you would see hashbrowns arent listed gluten free, I ask about the ingredients for each item (yes my body has forced me to be that person) and every single time until today (tuesday-monday) I have been reassured of the hashbrowns being potatoes and oil ONLY. The non gluten free aspect was simply the toast.

The diner was packed when we came early for breakfast. There was about a 10 minute wait before my party of 7 was seated. I ordered the Classic Rock entree which is your typical breakfast food - eggs, toast, hashbrowns and your choice of sausage or bacon. Food came out hot and was pretty good, however I didn't find it to be anything spectacular. Some other entrees my friends had ordered were their country fried steak, omelette burrito, and the aloha - all that looked a lot more tasty than mine! The proportions were decent and the prices were moderate.   Dinner on the other hand, not so great. We noticed on Yelp that they had a $9.99 prime rib special, but apparently it was only available on Sunday nights!! There was another special going on that evening (or should I say morning at 2am) which was their steak and shrimp special with a side of mashed potatoes and salad for $7.77! What a DEAL right?! Well, you really do get what you pay for! The steak I thought was super chewy and I took two bites of it and was not able to finish the rest. The mashed potatoes were salty as heck and I was NOT the only one who thought so!! The chef's taste bud was totally off that night. Of course we complained, but the waiter was rude and said there's nothing he can do about it and that's how the mashed potatoes are seasoned. Considering I was incoherent, I spooned him some mashed potatoes and told him to try it himself and tell me it's not salty!! He walked away careless of what he had to say with no sincere apologies what so ever! But moments later, the jerk waiter returned back with complimentary fries along with the remark of telling us he told the chef to add no salt to the fries because we don't like salt.

It wasn't very busy, so our drink orders were taken quickly. However, it took a little longer to have our food order taken. We each ordered the Gambler's Special, which is $7.77 for steak, 3 shrimp, mashed potatoes and a side salad. We were asked by the waitress if we had a player's club card. We told her that we didn't have one, so she told us that instead of $7.77, the cost would be $9.99. Had we known this, we would have signed up for a player's club card to get the discount. Having our hearts already set for steak and shrimp, we proceeded with our order.  We also ordered a few adult beverages - My hubby ordered the Monster Circus and I ordered the Blushin' Russian.   The reason why I give Mr. Lucky's 3 stars instead of something higher is because of the wait time and the quality of food. When our orders came, my husband's steak was cooked medium instead of medium rare like he asked and my steak came out completed well done, when I had asked for it medium. I thought about sending it back, but by then I was starving and in no mood to wait for another steak to be cooked.  The steak and shrimp were just ok. Nothing spectacular about it. The mashed potatoes came unseasoned, so we had to salt and pepper it ourselves.  Overall, for the price, the Gambler's Special isn't bad at all. Our drinks were really tasty, no skimping on the alcohol either. You can taste it, but not in an overwhelming way.

Roughly, 15 minutes later our server took our order.  I had the Waffle Wich, two scrambled eggs, ham, applewood smoked bacon, cheddar cheese, with sweet & spicy mayo sandwiched between two Belgian waffle halves and served with a side of hash browns.  Carol W ordered the California Omelet, a three-egg omelet with avocado, tomatoes, artichoke hearts, quinoa, onion sprouts, tomato, and mushrooms folded in and served with a side of hash browns and toast.  We noted that despite a nearly full dining room, we didn't see a lot of food coming out of the kitchen.  We waited...and waited...causing me to wonder if we'd have time to eat without inhaling our food.  Almost 20 minutes later our food arrived, and as expected, it was a big plate of food.  The contents of my Waffle Wich were bountiful, savory, cheesy, and filling.  The waffles were light and fluffy, but were also just plain Belgian waffles, lacking that  something  like sweetness that would've provided a contrast with the savoriness of the other components.  Perhaps a bit of maple syrup served on the side?  I should've asked for it.  I ended up eating everything but the waffles.  Carol's omelet, though, was delicious and definitely the better of our two selections.  Thankfully, getting and paying for our check went much quicker than getting our food.

Having worked in restaurants for years,  I understand that long ticket times lead to unhappy tables... While I've never seen anyone turn away tables,  I know this can be a rough spot for a restaurant,  especially if it's under staffed...   While we were told we couldn't eat on spot because of the kitchen back-up,  we were told that we could place a to-go order which would be out in 25 minutes..  This made no sense since a kitchen backup should affect both dine in and carryout orders. Ticket times for both should be the same.   Given the circumstances,  we chose to re-evaluate our food choices,  7 minutes later,  with nowhere else to go,  we chose to return to place a carryout order. We returned and noticed the host seating other tables.... The host informed us that they were now able to seat tables. We were confused,  irritated and couldn't help but wonder had this been something personal or just a show of poor restaurant management.   We were sat,  ordered an omelet and a salad,  neither of which were great and our server wasn't particularly friendly.   The food was ok, and I have to say it's truly  nice to have a 24/7 place to eat... Unfortunately,  the service,  especially on the part of the host was despicable.", "Date": "2014-12-27", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "John", "ReviewID": "QGEIIx66e_UPWdDj4bGwuw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Really chill place to stumble in and eat breakfast or lunch-depending on when you get up-after a wild night of partying.
