Condiments (called Dips) other than ketchup are an extra 65 cents.   We opted for the Giga size of Loopy Fries with Garlic Parmesan ($6.49). It's a bit pricy for frozen fries and seasoning, but a decent snack. The Garlic Parmesan was heavy, but very tasty and the curly fries were delicious. As a fry lover, having a kiosk where several types of fries are easily available is amazing.

I've had their tater tots and wasn't impressed. Honestly I think sonic tater tots are way better. Theirs were dry.   But this time I wanted a baked potato. The giant menu says chilli cheese and I ordered chilli cheese baked potato and added sour cream. The girl said its a chilli potato cheese is extra.  but the sign says chilli cheese not chilli. She said its chilli cheese is extra. I said fine add cheese then. So I pay 30 cents more for cheese and 30 cents more for sour cream. That's bullshit! Don't put on your menu chilli cheese baked potato and charge extra for cheese. And not only did she not have a cheese button to charge me for it was add chips!!!   I waited 20 minutes for this baked potato and she didn't even put it in a bag. Instead I had this really hot plastic container to carry back to my work. It was literally playing hot potato all the way back. The potato wasn't even good and I had wasted half of my lunch buying the damn thing. Yes I am still angry that it cost me over $5 for a rubbery baked potato and all I have to show for it was half of my lunch hour wasted and burnt hands.   Don't waste your time or money at this place. I won't.

So I can't be spending $4 for a small baggy of fresh potato chips everytime, you know.    To try at least once in a while, I'd say go for it.  Pick an unusual flavor though.

There was only one girl working and there were a bunch of customers who all came at the same time. She had to run back and forth from the cash register to the fries. (They make the fries very well so the process takes a little bit. You can watch them make it though the window). She was absolutely amazing! A few people were telling her,  Keep up the great work! You're doing well with the crowd.  With that being said.. they need to hire more people!! A second lady came out to the cash register 10 minutes after I got there but I think they could still use more help.   I can't wait to go back there to try the BBQ and the sour cream and onion seasoned fries. I'll just bring a book with me next time for the wait! (Not exaggerating..

The girl said it would take 5 minutes, which we were fine with. However, it took closer to 10 minutes, which we would've been fine with as well had she told us. But whatever, I'm not going to cause a scene over 5 minutes unless I was late to a movie or something.  The fries themselves are good, but nothing special. I could see the bags of frozen fries from the order window. They fry them up when you order and add the seasoning after.  The buckets looks small, but they filled them above the rim. They gave our fries in a to-go bag when we asked for it and offered us 2 cups of ketchup, which we gladly accepted.  Overall, a good place to catch a snack. Maybe even to get a snack that you can sneak into the theaters? So ladies, bring your oversized purses!
