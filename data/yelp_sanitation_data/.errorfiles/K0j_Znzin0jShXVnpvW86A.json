Do not be fooled by the Jose Andres name and the website glitz; this is a overpriced, lackluster tapas restaurant in a town where your money will be far better spent at any number of places in walking distance to this disappointment. Wife and I were terribly disappointed. Far from the romantic, fancy, or elegant dining experience we expected.   Décor - Do not come here expecting an elegant or fancy dining experience. Tables and chairs are cheap with visible wear and tear. Restaurant itself is placed in the middle of what can only be described as a strip mall of other restaurants. Deceivingly casual compared to how they market this restaurant online.   Service - While our server was friendly, he lacked professionalism, tried way too hard to be our friends opposed to our waiter, and drew away from our dining experience with cheesy lines and his life story. What's more, we had to listen to him do the same shtick to the tables around us throughout our meal.   Food - we did like the food. The boiled octopus, Ibarra plate, cured black-foot prosciutto, and suckling pig (only available Sundays) were absolutely delicious. The paella however was disappointing and over-salted. Portions were fine, but our biggest gripe was that everything is just far more expensive than it should be for the quality of food offered.   Bottom line, this restaurant's biggest problem is that that the casual décor and mediocre experience do not justify the price point even with decent food. Because you can't come here expecting anything fancy or romantic, your money is much better spent elsewhere.", "Date": "2014-12-30", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Nicole", "ReviewID": "S5xcip93iRSdxneO7e2Deg", "Overall": "3", "Content": "We had some great overpriced tapas, service was outstanding until it wasn't, and the decor and comfort of the place was suspect.  Let's start with the layout.  there were tables with uncomfortable chairs, or these long couches which went around the restaurant.  The couch things were comfortable if you were sitting back having a cocktail, but not so much if you were trying to eat a meal.  NOT a deal breaker, but weird.  The food -- some of it was great, some of it was ok, all of it was overpriced.  They had a specific vegetarian menu which was really nice.  Made it easier to find the veggie options on their extensive menu.  My friend (the vegetarian) had a goat cheese endive salad which which was divine.  A  warm  spinach salad, which was totally average and these weird eggplant things which were tempura fried and drizzled in honey, which she thought was good, I thought were a complete throwaway.  Three little founds of eggplant, almost tasteless but sweet from the honey for $9.00.  We both agreed it would have been better as a dessert.  I ordered piquillo peppers with a bit of iberico pork lardon, which was probably the best value on the menu.  $6.00 and completely tasty.  But definitely better to split and because of the pork I didn't have a person to share with.  I also ordered a cauliflower, date, olive dish which was divine.  My big splurge was Iberico Pork - which I thought was going to be roasted, but was in fact cured.  It was fine, it was good - but it was $35.00 an ounce.  For $35.00 I want a little more than some dried ham.  It came with a side of tomato bread, which I didn't know when I ordered it.  I HATE tomatoes.  I tried the bread, but I just couldn't do it, so I asked for some plain bread.  When the bill came, I was charged $12.00 for the bread.  TWELVE DOLLARS.    I asked the waitress, who had been stellar to this point, and she said they charge the same price for bread with or without the tomato  TWELVE DOLLARS.    She apologized for not telling me, and I told her I never would have paid TWELVE DOLLARS for bread.  (seriously, 6 slices of french type bread.) and she said she'd see what she could do.  Two seconds later, she was back with the full bill.   Did an an order of $12.00 bread ruin my experience?  Yes, yes it did.  What a stupid thing to upset a customer over.    Oh, I also had a $12.00 sangria.  It was adequate.  There's a place in Winters, I get a superior Sangria for $7.00.    Caveat Emptor.  Would I eat here again?  Before the $12.00 bread, yes.  After the $12.00 bread.  No.  I hope it was worth it.", "Date": "2014-06-09", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Sky", "ReviewID": "btM50-01QSPseAu9uBaFhQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Great tapas!!!

I like fried food, and for some reason this felt heavy, like it wasn't properly drained out of the fryer.  Bacon wrapped dates - again, a potentially great taste overwhelmed by the heavy deep fried grease.  Shrimp & garlic sauce - good  Endive w oranges, feta & almonds - highly recommended!  Skirt steak - my favorite!  Paella - they make fresh batches throughout the night, so whichever kind they prepare at the time is what can be ordered, minimum 3 people, we had the chicken & mushroom - it was good but not impressive  Sautéed spinach - cant go wrong  Fresh oysters - I'm not a fan of them but everyone else at the table thought they were fantastic  Monkfish - sliced thin, like a tartare but cooked, again not a fan of monkfish but everyone else liked it  There were a couple more dishes that I can't remember, but overall a good time.

I especially don't like tapas when I'm with coworkers or clients - it's awkward. You order shrimp but there's not enough for everyone. You order steak and someone's a vegetarian. You order soup and then feel guilty for eating the entire bowl yourself.   I'm selfish. I want my food to myself.  But Jaleo changed all of that.   Six of us ordered nearly everything off the menu and six of us wholeheartedly agreed not one thing was under par - instead, every.single.morsel satiated every.single.taste bud. A restaurant has never been so consistently delicious - so on top of their flavors and game that despite our full bellies, when two extra dishes arrived from the chef, we greedily scooped them up. (Chicken and rabbit paella and the chef's new spin on an old standby - garlic shrimp.)   We tried the selection of cheeses and my comrades the three Spanish-cured meats. We shared spoons in the garlic and grape soup (a favorite amongst the table), we slurped oysters, severed mussels, crunched apple/fennel/walnut salad, forked fried eggplant and... more? Yes, much more. The cod and honey empanada that melted once breaking its delicate shell, the homemade potato chips drizzled with spicy tomato sauce, the out-of-this-world garlic shrimp mentioned above and skirt steak (that I can't comment on because I didn't have any).   We devoured every last bit - not a crumb escaped our table. And when it came time for dessert? We split our waitress' two favorites with coffees and espressos.

Although we didn't have a reservation anywhere and were a relatively large party (seven of us), we figured it was late enough that we wouldn't have to wait much longer than 30-45 minutes for a table.  My wife and I and our siblings have lived in Manhattan for the past several years, so we were happy to see the list of restaurants at the newly opened Cosmopolitan.  We've been to Blue Ribbon (both Bakery and Sushi), Scarpetta, and Milos in NYC, enjoyed them all, and were confident that the other restaurants in the Cosmopolitan would be of similar high quality.  The first restaurant we saw when we got off the escalator that led up to the dining floor was Jaleo.  It looked great.  An open kitchen sat in the back of a bright and lively room.  The menu was interesting and the dishes sounded delicious.  Philadelphians, imagine a more casual Amada.  We settled on Jaleo and so my wife approached the hostess and asked her if she could accommodate our party.   The hostess looked at my wife and me.  It was immediately clear the calculations that were going through her head: are they good looking enough? do I like their clothes?  do I want them in my restaurant?  Just to give fellow Yelpers some context: my family and I are a reasonably good looking people by any measure and we were dressed casually but neat (ex. Business casual-jeans and no jacket for me).  The hostess glanced back into the dining room and pretended to weigh our options.   Sorry, I don't think we will be able to seat your party tonight.   A large empty table was at the front of the restaurant directly behind the hostess.   What about that one, is that being held?  my wife asked.   Oh it's not being held,  the hostess replied,  but that table would be too small, and also we don't have enough chairs.  And we're closing at 11PM.   The table was set up to seat four, could obviously comfortably seat six, but believe me, in NYC, would have sat eight.  My wife pointed out additional chairs that were unused by guests at other tables.  Another hostess, trying to be more helpful, scurried off to look for a couple more chairs.  The head hostess did not move.   I'm sorry there are just no chairs and we're closing in an hour, I really don't think we can seat you tonight.   We went back and forth like this for about five minutes, the hostess eying us up and down the whole time.    After a while, we left.  I hope at some point the hostess realized that she missed an opportunity for her restaurant to make more money (a group of seven, willing to dine at a table that usually seats four, which probably couldn't be filled the rest of the night).  Actually, scratch that, I hope she stays dumb the rest of her life.  Anyway, we went to Scarpetta instead, where the food was great, the service was better, and nobody made us feel like we were a lesser class of human being.", "Date": "2011-01-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Alexis", "ReviewID": "xDsPf2ZzQshC-067OTGHhw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "4.5     1 star for trying to scale and find this spot in the clusterfuck of the Cosmo in HIGH heels!!!!!   So I've been wanting to come to a Jose andres establishment for a long ass time! We made last minute rsvps and they told us the place was booked by one party and if it was ok to dine in the  lounge  area. Were like sure  no problem.  So we get to the Cosmo and this whole fuggin place is CF! The valet area sucks because the signage confuses the ish out of you. Anywho there was a concert going on and this meant more of a crowd than usual, im assuming. Finally we found the place. One thing im not feeling about these hotel eateries, is the feeling of being in some high end food court. All these places next to eachother and you can people watch the hell of whats going on. Its like a mall for real.    So tip toe over to the hostess desk and they tell us to wait a little and the wait was a little to much for me but the hostess was soooooooooo nice. I must say the staff here are top notch! When we were seated at first I was not feeling this area with straw type chairs and large wooden communal table. It was so uncomfortable but it was what it was. My inner prayers were answered because one of the lovely hostesses told me about the rich folks that booked the whole damn place were leaving YAY! She walked us to our new table and walking there she said we were nice people, im thinking no you guys are!!!! They were so nice and sweet. The best hostesses I've ever encountered!   So now were in those comfy booths. Im sippin on an adult shirley temple and pic a rum and coke with an ice ball. We start scaling the menu and some of the things I wanted the PIC didn't , like the Bikini De Jamón Ibérico, Queso Manchego Y Trufas , he basically called that a ham sandwich and why should we get that LOL. Ok find we didn't get it. So we started with the goat cheese stuffed peppers.  Those were so BOMB but I wish they served 4 of those crack peppas instead of two. Grrrrrrr.  Next dish was the veal cheek with these CRACK mashed potatoes. The potatoes were like silk! Not one lump. Just velvet.  Ordered the garlic shrimp and those were tasty but didn't look like the pics I've seen of this dish but who cares this was good. Next dish was this sausage mushroom stew type dish and that was tasty as well. Very good sausage dish and I love mushrooms!!!!!  One dish that was a lil iffy was the fried chicken wings with this black ink moussey thing brushed around the inside of the dish. That ink stuff was salty blah!  The fried chicken was good but not black peeps good hehe.  One downer is not being able to order the paella of your choice for a small party. You can order what they're making that moment which sucked because I wanted the lobster paella!!!! Not the chicken rabbit one!  Next time I'll show up with a party of 5 and Ill get that damn lobster paella!!!!!!!     We ended the night with the flan. The BEST flan I've ever had NOM NOM NOM NOMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!! I don't want to share that next time :D Damned good and went well with my dessert wine!

In fact, I was really surprised to see some of the items I've had at the Bazaar  on the menu at Jaleo. The waitress recommended that we order 2-3 dishes per person; we had 4 girls, and this is what we ordered:  1. Tortilla de Patata: Spanish omelet with onions and potatoes. Really fluffy omelet.  My friend who loves Spain and Spanish food really enjoyed it, especially since she has had such a hard time finding traditional Spanish Tortillas here in the States.  2. Garlic Shrimp: The sauce was really good, but this dish wasn't all that memorable  3. Patatas Bravas: Jose's version of this traditional Spanish bar food. Basically potato chips topped with spicy tomato sauce and garlic alioli. Really delicious combinations of flavors and textures.  4. Croquetas de pollo:  Chicken fritters SERVED IN A REAL SHOE! just like the Bazaar used to. I was so disappointed to learn that the croquetas at the Bazaar came in 'fake' shoes now. So i was so excited to see these come in a real shoe! The croquetas were AMAZING as well.  5. Rossejat: A paella type dish with pasta, shrimp and squid. Served with an amazing garlic alioli. Definitely comparable to the Rossejat at the Bazaar.  6. Grilled Quail: served with a really great apple puree and pinenuts.  7.Bikini de jamón Ibérico,  queso manchego y trufas: Pressed sandwich with iberico ham, manchego cheese, and truffles. BEST THING WE HAD ALL NIGHT!  8. Olive Oil Ice Cream: Another dish that is also served at the Bazaar. Really interesting combo of flavors. Highly recommend it for adventurous palates and grapefruit lovers.   9. Sangria: Great, but nothing I haven't had before.  Also, this place deserves 5 stars for their service. Our waitress was so sweet and attentive! I had really wanted to try the flan too, but they ran out! It wasn't even that late!

It is more expensive than Firefly. The atmosphere is not better than Firefly. But food is much better than Firefly - and yes, it should be because Jaleo is more expensive.  You kinda have to know what to order to enjoy this place. I go there a lot, so I know what to suggest.   Gazpacho (classic chilled spanish soup made with tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers and bread)  - very smooth and tasty. Refreshing! One of the best gazpacho I have ever eaten.  Ajo Blanco Con Cangrejo (chilled almond and garlic soup with crabmeat and green grapes)  If you like different stuff, you MUST get this. My favorite soup. I get this all the time. Yummy!  Mejillones A La Vinagreta De Miel - (mussels served with pipirrana, sherry dressing and honey)    This item is OK. You kinda be careful when you bite - if you feel it's bad, you should spit it away - because one of 10 mussels could be bad, even rotten. Nobody can tell if it's good or bad - Only your taste buds can tell. So, just be careful. My girl got sick eating one of them.   Pan De Cristal Con Tomate Fresco (toasted slices of uniquely crispy and ethereal bread brushed with fresh tomato) - Start your dinner with this one. Pretty good.  Aceitunas Rellenas Y Aceitunas 'ferrán Adrià' (olives stuffed with anchovy and piquillo and 'ferrán adrià' liquid olives) -    Good stuff! Perfect pair with wine!  Salmón Crudo Con Huevas De Salmón (salmon tartare and salmon roe cone) -this is an unique, small stuff that you can eat as if you are eating snacks or candy bars. Interesting. Pretty OK.   Ostras 'gin & Tonic' (five oysters with lemon, gin and tonic) - one of the best oysters you can get in LV. Much better than Joe's seafood at Caeser's.  Jamón Ibérico Fermín (cured ham from the famous, black-footed ibérico pigs of spain) - If you have never eaten iberico pork, you should try this. Iberico pork is something that you can eat medium rare even if it is a pig!  Chorizo Ibérico De Bellota Fermín (a dry-cured chorizo made with ibérico meat) - I thought it was OK. To me, it tasted too much - I am not a fan of chorizo. If you like chorizo, it should be fantastico!  Santa Gadea Con Albaricoques ((burgos) a soft-ripened organic goat cheese paired with dried apricots) - this is one of my favorites here. You will be amazed how good goat cheese could be! Very tasty and sensitive at the same time.   Huevo Frito Con Caviar (a fried organic egg topped with caviar) - they use good caviar for sure. I'm sure it's the same kind of one they use for  e  restaurant, hidden place in the back (I've eaten there as well - fantastico!)  Endivias Con Queso De Cabra Y Naranjas (endives, goat cheese, oranges and almonds) - one of their BEST appetizers - very refreshing - strongly recommended.  Costillas De Cordero Con Romesco (grilled lamb ribs with romesco sauce and green onions) - this is the only thing that I don't recommend. Not impressed at all. Get something else.  Paellas - all paellas are good - but the traditional paella is so popular that it sells out pretty quick. They sometimes have special seafood/lobster paellas for 45 bucks or so - kinda expensive but it's the best.   If you see my other reviews, you will find that I am a hard rater - I hardly ever rate 5 stars. This place surely deserve 5 stars if you know what to order. I don't care about the dim-lighting for atmosphere at other restaurant - this place is very open and bright so you can take a picture of your loved one! This place (well, entire Cosmo) is pretty loud, but it's worth checking out.   BTW, if you are very conservative on what you eat, then, maybe this is NOT the place. If you like to try new things, if you like to try the best goat cheese, if you like ethnic food, if you are not a grumpy old man, if you are not racist, if you are open in your mind,,, then, this is the place!  Service is very friendly and they are super nice.   My average check is 150 for two including 2 drinks, tax and 20% tips. I've paid only 100 one time including everything. It's all up to your stomach. Not bad for the Cosmo, AT ALL!

It's a very buttery, garlicky shrimp served in a small pan alongside with a bread, almost look like a french bread, but smaller. Taste of the shrimp was phenomenal! Very tasty, oily in a good way. There was some kick to it. At first, I didn't like the bread coz it was too hard to bite, but our server (very knowledgable) told me that I should try to deep the bread onto the sauce so the bread wont be that hard to eat. I love it! Then, I ordered  Presca Iberica Crudo Ahumado  oh boy, I tell you. The slices of meat with its oOh so creamy sauce was very tasty and when I was eating it, I felt some of kind of orgasmic/sexy feeling like you would eat your favorite chocolate on a midnight craving sort of thing. Addicting to eat! Very rich in flavor. Sauce was fantastic, it got some tanginess that balances the salty side of the meat. I will definitely recommend this fine dining resto to my family & friends.

We came in with a party of 7 people that night and left with fairly mixed reviews.  We were highly suggested to order the chef's experience, $55/$85 which included 10 tapas.  What we did not realize was that they brought out all the tapas on three plates for 7 people.  This meant we did not really even know if they brought out the correct portions or amount of food since they threw it all onto three plates.  For some dishes we only got 2 plates instead of three as they forgot to bring it out.  Some people didn't get some of the extra tapas they ordered and it was a nightmare as they paid for food they did not consume.  The waiters/waitresses made this entire experience very unorganized and unprofessional.    The food did come out in a decently timely manner which was good.  In general I would say avoid the chef's experience.  Although it's 'ten' items, a lot of them are just filler items.  Many of the items tasted overly cooked or almost fermented.

One thing i didn't enjoy much was cracking open the lobster on the paella with my hands and making a mess. The black bean-ish sauce was pretty amazing though.

Up until now, we've been disappointed each time. The disappointment ended when we went to Jaleo. The restaurant is up on the 3rd level in The Cosmopolitan Hotel. Riding up in the glass elevator is a great way to start the evening. Ambience: the restaurant is a very open area. On walking in, there is a very handsome bar on the left. Straight ahead is a large open pit area where they cook their meats and prepare Skillets of paella. Whenever a skillet of paella is completed, the chef rings a bell and shouts out something in Spanish. This adds some festivity to the overall atmosphere. In the center there is a glassed-in area where much of the food preparation is done. Try to get a table next to that area. Watching the preparation has high entertainment value. Service: almost immediately after we sat down Mario, a server was at our table to greet us and to help explain many of the items on the menu. So many items sounded so good that we decided to order two tasting menus for the four of us. This resulted in food runners coming to our table frequently and the busboy coming to clear frequently. Additionally, Mario came by frequently to make sure that everything was going well. When we had a minor problem with one dish he corrected it immediately. Service was truly outstanding throughout the night. Food: there was so many dishes on the menu that were new to us that we wanted to try a lot of them. We felt the best way to go was to order two tasting menus for the 4 of us. If it turned out not to be enough, we could always order something extra off the Tapas menu. As it turned out, there was more than enough food for 4 in tasting menu for two. The meal started off with pan de cristal- a tomato bread. This was followed by cana de cabra - goat cheese chorizo. Excellent presentation and excellent taste. The next dish was a small portion of gazpacho. Also outstanding. Next came the endive orange goat cheese salad. Very light and tasty, perfect for a warm summer night. This was followed by a very small cone filled with veggies and topped with an anchovy. I'm not a big fan of anchovies. My wife, who is a fan, said it was delicious. The next courses included mushroom croquettes, a watermelon salad, a halibut tomato squash stew, and Carne asada. Each dish was better than the last. Then came the chicken and mushroom paella. Phenomenal!! For dessert they serve the chocolate custard. Value: wonderful ambience, fabulous service, and phenomenal food, all for $75 a couple. This has to be the very best value for food in Las Vegas.", "Date": "2016-06-26", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Manda Bear", "ReviewID": "fvCqeo-MxYuH5T8loux7Qw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "************************** 537 ****************************            I've been dining at Jaleo back in the day when it was at original location in Crystal City, Alexandria, VA (right at borderline of DC).

I can say that the service was decent, and that even though we did not have a good meal....or any meal at all, the manager was extremely attentative. It was refreshing that he came to our table after the first two dishes were taken away and he noticed we had not touched much of either.

And some of it is super delicious.   Caña de cabra con higos - Amazing. Super delicious. Order it. Patatas Bravas - Also quite tasty. This was by far the best 'bang for your buck' of the plates we got. Chorizo casero con puré de patatas al aceite de oliva - The potato had better flavors than the chorizo. I don't know if that speaks to how amazing the potato puree was or if the chorizo was a little tame. Gambas al ajillo - I don't eat shrimp, but my friends said the sauce that came with this was some of the tastiest of the meal. They were sad to not have bread or something to soak up the rest of it. I'm realizing as I look at the menu that they brought me the wrong tuna. No wonder I was disappointed. I thought someone must have eaten the goat cheese before it got to me, but no.

After about 10 minutes all I could think about was the 30 rock where Jack sells his awful couches to the government to be used as torture devices. This sounds like a comedic exaggeration- but seriously it was so uncomfortable, and when you are going to be somewhere for three hours a good chair is a must.  2. The service- was very slow. We had a conversation about how we probably would of ordered twice as much stuff if the server had actually come around frequently. Paying the bill from the time we requested it took about 40 minutes.    Now, given those two things imagine how good the food was to earn 4 stars-pretty freaking good.   Jamón Ibérico De Bellota Fermín- this is like prosciutto I guess- it comes sliced very thinly and artfully arranged on a plate. I have often heard people say  melt in your mouth  but honestly I have never really had anything melt in my mouth... until now. The white, fat part of each slice did in fact quickly turn to a liquid when you put each piece into your mouth. Now, this comes with some bread (Pan De Cristal Con Tomate Fresco-which we also ordered as an appetizer) and I have to say there is no better illustration of a tale of two cities than this bread paired with the pig- it is terrible. It was very hard/crusty, and it has what appear to be raw tomatoes just sort of mashed into it. Did not like-although the people I was eating with liked it- but trust me they are morons.   Dátiles Con Tocino 'Como Hace Todo El Mundo'-as far as I know I have never eaten a date before. Wrapping something in Bacon and then frying it is a good way to introduce someone to new foods- try it with your kids and broccoli.   Croquetas De Pollo- these are awesome- like a mini chicken Cordon Bleu  Chistorra envuelta en patata frita - this is a little cocktail weenie sized chorizo sausage wrapped in a potato chip and fried. They are good, but not one of our favorites.  Gambas Con Gabardina- these tempura shrimp were hands down our favorite of the appetizers- amazing ( if lobster tempura at Flemmings is a 10, these are a solid 9) and the sauce that comes with them is great.   José's Taco- this is a play on  taco  NOT AN ACTUAL TACO. That is key. Its basically a little piece of the Jamón Ibérico De Bellota Fermín with a scoop of caviar on top. It is quite tasty, but not an actual taco.  Mini Pepito De Ibérico-this was one of the group favorites, in fact one person lamented in hindsight that they should have just gotten 8 of these. Its a little  wet  for lack of a better word- I assume due to all the pig inside it there is a lot of grease- and that could be a turn off for some people, we call them quitters.   Chorizo Casero Con Puré De Patatas Al Aceite De Oliva-this was one of my favorites- little slices of chorizo in a potato pure- both elements are excellent.   I definitely wanted to try more things (like the pork skirt steak) but we decided to wrap it up after 3 hours.   Overall I really liked Jaleo but I think honestly I prefer Julian Serrano- they have a more diverse menu (like those little pizzas that must have heroin in them) better regular human height chairs, and better service. Jaleo seems higher end, and the acorn fed pig is truly delicious but the total package of the restaurant is not as good.", "Date": "2014-05-08", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Kristyne", "ReviewID": "VxOmWTVF74DxtM-Oc_cImg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "3.5 stars?

We ordered up the paella feast, which includes beet gazpacho, a salad with some fancy sounding vinaigrette, and a paella plate. The place decor is really nice and you could see a whole pig being roasted on an open fire in the middle of the food prep area.  The gazpacho was presented in a very fancy fashion and was served inside a neat modern cup, drizzle with some olive oil, topped with fresh-looking oval croutons. However, one bite in and the taste of salt just overpowered all the other flavors. I could still eat it but I felt as if I was eating condensed gazpacho.  Then was the salad. The salad was literally a couple large lettuce leaves with 5 olives, two slices of tomato and red onion dressed in some vinaigrette. We thought they forgot to bring out a second salad serving but the waitress had placed the bowl in the middle of our table which made me realize that it was meant to share. A bit stingy and didn't really seem like restaurant quality.  Finally, we waited on the paella. We figured the paella would be wonderful and rich and full of flavor. Instead we received plates of undercooked rice (supposedly al dente..) and extremely dry chicken. The entire place was hard to chew and tasted too salty.  Overall, I would not go back here again and I wouldn't recommend my friends to come here. The overall experience did not satisfy me especially for the price.

The wife and I have had reservations at The Bazaar, E, and Jaleo before and each time we had to cancel for various reasons.  We finally made it to Jaleo this time in Vegas.  We were seated almost right away and the had a pretty casual atmosphere for such a highly touted restaurant.  We started out with the Pan Con Tomate which is pretty much a bruschetta.  I was like its just tomato and bread but I gotta admit that it was pretty tasty.  So far so good.    Next came the world famous Jamon Iberico Ham.  Nicely cured ham, similar to a proscuitto, but for $18 we got 3 small slices.  Good stuff but not worth the price in my opinion.    Got a good review of the paella from a buddy so we had to try.  The paella for the night was the Iberico Short Rib Paella.  The wife thought it a bit salty, but it was very good.  Wild mushrooms gave it a great earthy flavor and the Iberico Short Ribs were awesome.    Then the bacon wrapped dates fried in a batter.  I guess it was okay but its not something I would order again.  Nothing special here.  The Calamares Tinta was pretty much the best squid I've ever had.  Squid usually ends up overcooked and tough or chewy.  This squid was sooooo tender.  More important, the squid flavor was not masked by some overwhelming sauce.  It comes with squid ink as the sauce and is just a great squid dish.  Last, but not least, the Carilleras which is veal cheeks.  Anyone who has had veal cheeks knows that they are just so tender, melt in your mouth good.  This was no different.  Served on creamy, fluffy, mashed potatoes.    As an aside, the wife as very impressed by the Spanish Red Wine that she ordered.  It is called Montecastrill.  Nice and smooth, medium bodied, and that's about all I can say because I'm not a wine conissoeur.  In short, I was impressed by Jaleo.

We were going to be in Vegas for our 34th wedding anniversary and thought we would treat ourselves to a great meal, boy were we wrong.  A pet peeve of mine is patronizing a lovely expensive restaurant for a romantic dinner and being seated right next to another couple when there are plenty of open seats.  We had it happen and watched it happen several times while dining.  There were 75% of the seats empty yet couples being sat right next to another couple.  If the hostess is trained that way to ease the servers so there isn't so much space between tables she needs to be retrained as there were more idle servers, bussers and food deliverers than there were employees working.  We also saw the hostess attempt to seat an elderly couple on a bench seat where gramma would have to climb over big fluffy pillows to get to her seat.  Grampa asked for a different table and after a harumph and an eye roll were moved to one of the many many open tables.  We had reservations for the day we arrived in Vegas,  we got in and settled a little early.  We were hungry so arrived early to see if we could be seated early.  We were greeted warmly and sat immediately at a wooden table that had never been properly laquered and was sticky and had a peeling paint. Looking over the cocktail and beer menu should have been a warning sign.  The specialize in gin and tonics; several different gins and tonics available but not being gin or tonic fans that did not appeal to either of us.  At an upscale restaurant I expect a wine list of at least 10 offering in each category of wine.  Not 10 total wine offerings.  The wine I selected was good and I was happy with it. My husband is a beer snob and was hoping for a nice selection as well.  He was disappointed also.  They had 2 draught offering and the waitress had to check to see if one had been restocked.  They had 5 bottle offerings with one being an NA beer.  We ordered 6 different tapas as well as one of the paella selections; the cheese plate and chorizo plate were the only 2 that we would even consider reordering.  At $10 for a cheese plate I agree with many other reviews on YELP that it should have come with crackers or bread.  The stuffed calamari was tasteless and bland, the rabbit/chicken paella was also tasteless and dry,  the potato wrapped chorizo was crunchy-about all I can say as a positive. The grilled asparagus wasn't cooked long enough,  it had a nice green color but was not tender or tasty.  We left without having dessert, which is a first for us as we just couldn't take any more disappointment.

Much better atmosphere and vibe than his DC restaurant by the same name, although nothing can compare to the culinary madness of his Hollywood outpost, Bazaar.  As other reviewers have commented, the plates are small, and the prices are a tad on the high side.  But as usual with Andres, the dishes are creative, the presentation is beautiful, and the ingredients are outstanding.  The pan con tomate was very authentic and the bread was great.  The seleccion de embutidos (various Spanish hams and sausages) was of course amazing (you can't screw up good chorizo or jamon iberico de bellotas).  The bacon wrapped dates were a very nicely done rendition of this Spanish classic.  The olives two ways (a la Feran Adria) are always a delight, especially the molecular liquid olives, and this version featured a black olive, very different from the green olive versions we have had before.  The high point of the entire meal may have been the veal cheeks, slowly braised until they were fall-apart tender, and served with some creamy mashed potatoes and a couple of lovely home-made potato chips.  The gambas al ajillo was the only dish we didn't enjoy - too much tomatoes (we prefer just garlic and oil).

The food was mediocre and REALLY not worth the prices charged...   I visited by myself during lunch before my friends arrived at the hotel for my friend's bachelorette party weekend.

I was hoping for something substantial, but the food was disappointing.  The salad consisted of a few pieces of lettuce with not much sauce or anything special to it.  The gazpacho soup was good, but small.  And the paella?  It took forever to come out (at least 20 minutes) and it was a TINY portion!  I was not full leaving the restaurant.

The sangria had a nice blend of fresh fruits and it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet. I don't particularly like sweet sangria so this was very easy to drink.  For food we started with a Manchego Cheese Bocadillo.  It reminded me of the baguette sandwiches in Paris.  The flauta bread wasn't too tough or crunchy which was great but this was my least favorite item of the evening.  We also ordered Patatas Bravas and it was 5 stars all the way!  The potatoes were crisp yet soft.  The spicy tomato sauce and alioli complemented the potatoes nicely.  Next came the Gambas al Ajillo which was basically shrimp sautéed in garlic. Great tapas dish!  We were still hungry so we decided to order 2 more dishes.  After perusing the large menu we went with Carne Asada and Chistorra Envuelta en Patata Frita.  Sounds fancy but it's chorizo wrapped in crispy potato.  These final 2 dishes were amongst our favorite!  I also adored the presentation of the wrapped chorizo. (see pics)  Our top pick of the evening was the Carne Asada which arrived last.  Our server didn't ask how we wanted it prepared but it came out perfectly to our liking - medium to medium rare.  The skirt steak was extremely flavorful and juicy.  TIP: Make a reservation as it can fill up quickly!  We went on a weeknight but being that it was CES week they were very busy.

It's lighter than most and has just a clean finish to it (Sangria has a tendency to be either sickenly sweet or harsh from the cheap Wine) neither which you will get when you order Sangria form Jaleo.  It's memorable and quite addictive; forever ruining Sangria ordered anywhere else..  Pan con Tomate y Jamon Serrano: A classic Spanish dish and great way to open up your taste buds is the Toasted Bread with Tomatoes on top with Serrano Ham, drizzled with a touch of Spanish Olive Oil. The heavenliness is in the crunchy carbs married with soft, acidic texture and creaminess of fat. it sates all senses and leaves the appetite wanting more...  To balance the meal a bit, we ordered a Salad, the Remolacha con Citricos: Salad of Red Beets + Citrus +La Peral Cheese + Pistachios + Sherry Dressing.  The salad was balanced and harmonious with that unique flavor that Beets have with a mild acidity that was pleasant.  A great little dish to get at Jaleo is the Mixed Olives, Aceitunas Rellenas y Aceintunas Ferran Adria:  Olives stuffed w/ Anchovy + Piquillo and Ferran Adria Liquid Olives.  This little number is awesome with drinks; salty, briny and bathed in luxurious Olive Oil, both traditional and avant grade version entertain the palate, as wells the mind.  There are so many dishes at Jaleo that are so awesome and deserve special recognition; the Sunday Roasted Pig and the Lobster Paella to name a few.  But due to timing issues, we weren't able to order those, so the highlighted dish is a special favorite in the seafood category, Calamares en su Tinta: Basque style Squid Stew with Ink.  I'm a firm believer that that this may be the best, softest Squid that I have ever had; the Ink sauce was so savory in conjunction with the lime colored concoction which I wasn't' able to recognize, but relished it with fervor. I can't say I remember it with Ramps and Micro Greens but it's added value in any case.  It was truly hard to tear ourselves away from Jaleo, but we were on a mission to explore and more needed to be done.  So down the hatch with our last sip of Sangria and moved On To The Next One (Hold up freeze. Somebody bring me back some money please....)", "Date": "2012-11-04", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Joe", "ReviewID": "TxLyYHXfNlEIDyMyh52wTw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Tapas, tapas, tapas with good service.

We went for happy hour, which was listed in a recent article on Vegas happy hours and is shown on the restaurant's web site. We arrived at 5p to find an empty bar. We asked the hostess about happy hour, and she said,  We don't have happy hour. Oh, you saw it on the website? Yeah, I don't know why that's there, the manager knows about it.  The happy hour pricing wasn't the driving force in our going there, but it would have been nice.  We were hungry and wanted a snack and a wine before dinner later, and we have been to other Jose Andres restaurants, including Jaleo in DC, so we went forward with our plan.   Service at the bar was terrible. We had several different people asking us what we wanted and putting in our order, except they didn't actually put some of the orders in. The bar servers were nice about helping us choose wine and cheese, but were otherwise inefficient. We waited awhile for the cheese plate to come out, then the tomato bread never came. I finally asked one of the people behind the bar if we did order the bread, and she said, oh the other person doesn't seem to have put that in! So now our cheese plate is finished and we're done with our wine, and it's another 5 minutes for the bread to come out. The bread was amazing, but would have been even more amazing if it had been out with the wine and the cheese.  Normally we'd have ordered more food and wine, but the experience at this point was so disappointing, we bagged it and paid the check. $75 for two glasses of wine, 3 pieces of cheese, some glazed popcorn, and bread. We are big tapas fans, so it's not like we don't know that these things add up, and the quality of the food was great, but come on, that was crazy considering we didn't even get good service.

If you want a quiet and subtle dinner, go sneak a sandwich into a library because this place ain't for you.  This restaurant is also my favorite restaurant in Vegas, taking over the esteemed spot that my beloved Rosemary's Restaurant held for a while (before closing).  What is so great about this place? The food, drinks, service and decor. Did I miss anything? It was fun.  Jaleo is a Spanish Tapas restaurant, so you'll be ordering multiple, small dishes consisting of flavorful servings from the mind of Jose Andres. This wonderful guy might be Spain's greatest ambassador to the world since Fernando Alonso tossed his F1 career in the trash by going to Ferrari. But I digress...  We ordered a number of dishes (mostly the GF's favorites, because a happy GF is a happy GF), and enjoyed the offerings more than any restaurant in recent times. And by enjoyed, I mean  got a kick out of what we had.   Dishes that we enjoyed:  - Pan con tomate with Spanish anchovies: The GF loves anchovies and these white anchovies were a knockout. She wholeheartedly approved of this dish.  - Spherical Olives: Molecular gastronomy right here. It looks like an olive, but it's not. Think of a thin membrane that contains the most intense olive juice you will ever experience. Explosion of Olives as soon as you pop one in your mouth.  - Selecciónes de embutidos: A selection of cured Spanish meats. Nice!  - Canelones de cerdo y foie con bechamel: (From the menu)  Pork and foie gras canelones with béchamel sauce  - lots of flavor but I wish it was larger so I could indulge myself more. I could've just ordered two dishes and been content, FWIW.  - Croquetas de pollo: Chicken fritters that we demolished in no time.  - And my favorite: José Andrés' Gin and Tonic. This is the Ultimate G&T I've ever had. The nice thing is that I'm  almost  able to duplicate it at home w/ the following:  A shot or two of Hendrick's Gin (required - no other Gin will do) One entire bottle of Fever Tree Tonic Water (you can find this in Honolulu at Tamura's) Three Juniper Berries (find them in your spice shops) A sliver of lemon skin with NO PITH. 1/2  by 2  A thin slice of Lime There's one more leaf that I never got the name of. It wasn't Mint or Shiso but I don't use it at home (whatever it is)  - There were a few more plates that were rather good, but I was pretty bulletproof by that time from the Gin and Tonics. So I can't remember what we finished off with exactly.  Tip: Ask for Donny as your server - extremely knowledgeble, funny and observant. The manager John was very excellent and attentive as well, along with our female server on visit #2 (sorry, I missed her name but tipped her well - she was great too!). They treated the GF and I wonderfully on our second visit a few nights later also.  If you haven't noticed, I really enjoy great food with the GF.

Ensalada Verde Con Achoas & than the main entree of Paella; chicken & mushroom. I love the flavors of latin food so I of course had to compliment my meal with a beverage; the sangria! It offered the perfect amount of fruity-ness yet refreshing with their basil in it. As Jaleo is known for tapas, in addition to our order we had to at least try another dish or two. We tried the cured chorizo and their version of brushetta. The chorizo is highly recommended; definitely small bites but the flavor was amazing and a little kick as well. The brushetta, well its a bit salty for my liking and would probably pass on this. But my main dish, the paella. It reminded me of a rice bowl with protein and veggies mixed in. I've never had paella before so I am unsure the flavor I was hoping to capture. However, the production and presentation is worth it in the end. They cook this in the open flame right in the open area towards the back. Once completed, bells are ringing and people say PPPAAAEEELLLLAA!

Jaleo is a Spanish tapas restaurant and I was delighted to see so many authentic Spanish dishes on the menu like patatas bravas, enasaladilla rusa, tortilla, I could go on and on. I studied in Spain during college and I will say that Jaleo is about as close as I've seen to authentic Spanish cuisine in the states.  I was dining solo on this visit, so I sat at the bar and was fortunate enough to have dinner during happy hour. I tried the cava sangria and didn't love it, but it was sangria, so it was still pretty good. If I were to order again, I think I'd try to red sangria or the sherry.  I ordered the coca happy hour appetizer along with the gazpacho (based on reviews. The coca was decent but the gazpacho was OUT OF THIS WORLD. Seriously, it was delicious. It didn't have the acidic taste/flavor that I'm used to and was a bit lighter (did it have cream in it) than typical gazpacho. I also ordered the cono salmon and the aceitunas (both liquid and stuffed olives). If you haven't had a liquid olive before, it is quite the experience. I don't want to give the surprise away, but it would be a shame if you went here and didn't try them. I didn't quite care for the liquid olives, but it was awesome to finally try one.  As far as atmosphere goes, they nailed that one. In addition to the real wood fires burning in the back of the restaurant under the paella pans, they also have comfortable seating and fancy glasses for the cocktails.

That being said, some of their younger male wait staff were polite and professional.  Mediocre value, at best. Yes, this is the Cosmopolitan and an upmarket location - but if you are going to bend me over the barrel whilst I dine, at least serve me larger portions or improve the quality of your food.

The gin and tonic was really good, but it is expensive. :(  We ordered the garlic soup, dates with bacon, monk fish, patatas bravas, brussel sprout salad, and the lamb ribs. We wanted to get the paella instead of the ribs, but they only make one type of paella each night and it happened to be lobster. If you have food allergies make sure you ask your waiter about it. Their seafood stock uses crab meat so I couldn't eat it...really disappointed about that, but what can you do.   The only thing I disliked was the monk fish. It was too sour for my taste. Everything else was great! My favorites were the lamb ribs and the patatas bravas. The meat on the ribs was juicy and had an awesome crust. The patatas bravas is interesting.

We absolutely loved it, but it's not exactly a dinner you need to do multiple times. So this time around we decided to stop into Jaleo.   We came in during social hour on 9/29/16 after eating a few plates at Scarpetta. We sat at the bar and got an order of calamari and the potatoes bravas. I ordered sangria and my husband asked the bartender, Stephen, for advice on a vermouth. The vermouth Stephen picked out was so amazing I ordered one once I was done with my sangria. We had a lovely time enjoying a few drinks and chatting with Stephen. The couple next to us ordered the jamon iberico la bellota and it looked so good we decided to order it as well. I also ordered a glass of wine, since Albarino is my favorite wine style and hard to find. The iberico may be expensive at $35 an ounce, but it is absolutely worth it. The tomato covered bread it comes with is somehow equally to die for.   We left Vegas on Saturday 10/1 on an evening flight. Since we needed to pick up our checked bags at Cosmo before leaving for the airport, we decided it made the most sense to eat dinner at Cosmo. We would up going to Jaleo again because it was that good. We got two of the iberico sliders, a few cheeses, and...the jamon iberico la bellota again...I figured, when in Rome. It's not really something we can get at home. We finished with the gin and tonic dessert which was light and ephemeral. I enjoyed a few glasses of wine and my husband tried a few sherries.   Everything we had here was amazing. The bar service on the second visit was a bit abysmal at first. But halfway through Stephen came back into work and made sure we were taken care of.

Rossejat-My first time trying paella, I can't say that I was impressed because the pasta was stuck to the pan and we found ourselves scraping the pan to get something onto our plate.  Flavor was definitely there, you could taste the squid and shrimp throughout.   Vieiras con slasa de romesco-OMG, this was my favorite!! This is not your itty bitty scallop.  It is two large scallops flavored in a romesco sauce.  2 pieces don't sound like a lot for $18...but go for it.  It almost gave the Barrymore hardrubs.   Canelones tradicionales de cerdo de y pato con salsa bechamel-This was Pork and Foie gras canelones, cooked in cheese.  Okay they had me at Foie gras, I wanted to eat the whole thing to myself.  I was scraping everything off of that plate.

It was a hangar steak sliced and served with a pepper confit.  It was about 4 ounces for $14...not worth it at all.    What was interesting is watching the chef make the paella with a wood burning open kitchen.  This created a very aromatic scent to the restaurant.  I ordered the paella iberico, which included pork ribs.  The paella was deliciously prepared and I was impressed by the saffron flavors every bite had.  I was VERY disappointed to have only two pieces of pork ribs that were about 1 inch in length and had mostly skin.  This plate costed $32 and honestly, it was really worth about $6 because it was only rice.    If the plates were more substantial, I could have given Jaleo 4 stars.

I am a bigger sucker for Spanish tapas.. any experience that allows me to nibble and share different small meals and something modern, I will be ALL OVER IT.  Jaleo is located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel and it is a restaurant where it allows you to enjoy a variety of small plates, enjoy authentic paellas, superb sangria, and a wide selection of the finest Spanish cheeses, wines, and Sherries, all in a lively, casual atmosphere. It is definitely more of a casual environment, if you don't wear anything fancy, you don't feel out of place at all which is nice for tourists.   Service- Good and efficient. Changes your plate after a few meals which I like when waiters do on their own.   Now lets talk about the food:  Sangria- We ordered the red sangria of course full of flavor but DAYAM that stuff is strong. I don't know if they don't add enough ice or they add a ton of wine but yea.. REALLY strong. I could hold my liquour and I was already pretty buzzed after 2 drinks..  Pan con tomate with jamón Serrano Fermín- Basically a nice rustic bread with a spread of tomato sauce and a slice of ham on top. So basic, so simple, but oh so good! I would recommend you get the one with manchego cheese if you love your cheese. The pair with the saltiness of the cheese is delish!  Croquetas de pollo- Traditional chicken fritters.. this was okay. Basically taste like chicken croquettes, same fried batter as the croquettes. Nothing special or out of this world.   Chistorra envuelta en patata frita- Slightly spicy chorizo wrapped in crispy potato. This is a must get at Jaleo. It is so cute! Its like little mini chorizos wrapped around by a potato chip and served on a tooth pick. I love the saltiness of the tiny chorizo and the crunchiness of the potato. Together is great!  Empanadillas de brandada de bacalao- 'Empanada' of cod brandade with honey, delicious delicious delicious. Careful when you eat this cause its all gooey brandade inside.  For some reason I thought it was be actual fish pieces inside but it is basically liquid fish. Sounds weird but its good!  Gambas al ajillo- The very, very famous tapa of shrimp sautéed with garlic. Deliciously garlicky perfectly cooked shrimp!  Butifarra casera con mongetes 'Daniel Patrick Moynihan'- Homemade grilled pork sausage with sautéed white beans. Who doesn't like sausage with beans.. definitely homey and rustic taste.   Paella de pollo y lobster- Lobster paella is super salty. I was really disappointed by this dish. It was just regular paella, hardly any lobster meat, and just super salty!!  Flan al estilo tradicional de mamá Marisa con espuma de crema catalana- A classic Spanish custard with 'espuma' of Catalan cream and oranges. Man.. the texture of the flat is firm custardy, it is sweet, plus the sourness of the oranges is delicious! Not too sweet which is how I like my dessert.

Flavors were amazing and we'll balanced.  Definitely for those that enjoy a good strong cocktail.    Tator tots were amongst my favorite things! Not a fan of the shoe presentation.  Who wants food served in a shoe.  I'm sure the shoe was clean but a bit to ambitious of a presentation for my liking.  But it was delicious.    The bruschetta was absolutely amazing.  The toast it was served on was perfect.  Loved it.    The shrimp in the tomato sauce was also on point.    Great food,  great service and great ambiance.

But our tastes were able to converge and Jaleo was a universal hit on food and flavor.  The dishes I remember ordering included pan con tomate, tortilla de patatas, vieras con romesco (scallops), bacalao fritters, eggplant and honey, croquetas, and lobster paella.  I know we got more but I think it's probably telling that I don't recall the other dishes.  While I have always wanted to go to a Jose Andres place and I love tapas, I feel like tapas are so commonplace that I really wasn't sure how this place could surprise.  But I was wrong.  Some of the flavor combinations truly were unique, surprisingly, and foodgasm delicious.  The standouts were the bacalao fritters and lobster paella.  The sweetness of the honey mixed with the cod was delicate, comforting and unusual in the most delightful way.  And the lobster paella made me want to lick the plate clean.  It had perfectly balanced seasonings, juicy perfectly cooked lobster meat, and was just spectacular.  Everyone was vying for more paella.    Ultimately we were all extremely pleased with the quality of the food and how affordable our bill came out to be.  The only notes that marred the experience were the overly sweet sangria (not worth getting) and our waitress who had a little bit of an attitude and could have been far more attentive.

From the beginning the atmosphere at the Cosmopolitan Hotel is flashy yet not overly commercial.  The restaurant has a great external appeal, with an open eating area, mostly white decor and big chunky tables for seating in the overflow area.  The wait staff seemed young and a little under experienced.  We got shifted wait staff within the first 10 minutes of being in the restaurant and the young lady we were left with was bubbly, yet didn't know quite what she was serving as in experience.  She also had a painfully short attention span and would walk from the table without warning.  The wine list was heavy on $100+ bottles with a scattering of under $100 bottles.  We opted for a $48 bottle since we didn't need anything expensive and the bottle was still excellent.  If you go, don't bother with the American wines, as those are priced way above the $100 mark per bottle and for a casual tapas meal, IMHO you don't need to spend the money when most of the wines on the list are probably good selections.  We started with a board of all the cured meats, which included both the iberrico hams, the chorizo, serrano and pork loan.  We paired that with some manchango cheese which all together was great with the bottle of wine we were enjoying. And the quality of meat was a good amount for two people to share.  Next we had the salmon roe cones, which looked like a borrowed dish from Thomas Keller's French Laundry with a play on the ice cream cone.  The cones had salmon roe on top and filled with crab, which was tasty, but the roe didn't really stand out much.  We then had the egg topped with caviar, which was spectacular, but it wasn't the egg or the caviar which made it, but the caramelized onions under the egg made it a home run.  All together it rocked, but if it didn't have caviar on it, I don't think you'd notice a difference.  Then came our seafood tapas, we had the shrimp and scallop dishes, which were both excellent and cooked perfectly.  Out of the two, the shrimp was the clear winner, and if I did it again, I'd get two of those rather than the scallops.    Our last tapas was the veal cheeks, which were served over mashed potatoes, which was like a braised short rib without the unnecessary fat.  Very tasty, but I'd like a little finishing salt on it to bring it home and cut the richness a bit.  After it was all said and done with we signed the not so expensive bill with a couple expressos which was absolutely a great finish as the expresso was very smooth and went well with the whole meal.", "Date": "2012-01-23", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jennifer", "ReviewID": "rypP8AgDcPN3D6PuA05rcg", "Overall": "3", "Content": "I would give Jaleo 3 1/2 stars. The food was good overall. Must of the items that we ordered were good but only a few were outstanding - piquillo peppers stuffed with goat cheese and the paella were particular stand outs.

I didn't like that the number of servings for each dish was variable and the server didn't mention this when we ordered. We had 4 people.

After two evenings of fine dining on the strip, my BF told me he's had enough of it, and he wanted something more relaxing. After I was forcibly concurred with his opinion, I immediately cancelled our reservations with Joël Robuchon and suggested tapas for dinner. Luckily, his highness granted my suggestion and told me to pick one that's good enough so I'll be able to keep my head. Of course, at first I was a bit dubious since I read tons of not-so-good reviews about Jaleo, and had Julian Serrano in mind. But then I thought to myself: I enjoyed China Poblano and SAAM (back in Los Angeles,) how bad can José Andrés' Jaleo be? As it turned out, I've made the right decision!!  The restaurant itself is conveniently located on the third floor of Cosmopolitan, which is where we were already staying at... We were seated promptly upon arrival (unlike Le Cirque...,) and our wonderful server Paul M. couldn't had been nicer. He's attentive, and made lots of knowledgeable suggestions throughout the entire meal.   Since Jaleo is famous for its Gin and Tonics, Paul M. suggested  Cítrico  to me, which was light and refreshing as he described. My BF opted for a carafe of red sangria, and every sip was heavenly accompanied with the citric taste. And if none of these drinks interest you, don't panic, they have their drink menu well organized on an iPad for you to pick.  As a given, neither me nor my BF understand Jaleo's extensive tapas menu, luckily Paul M. was there to save the day. Based on our palates, Paul M. made the following suggestions:  Vieiras con mojo rojo y polvo de almendras  (two large scallops served with mojo rojo sauce, seared to just the right point, very juicy and tender,)  Gambas al ajillo  (Garlic Shrimp, at first I thought it was going to be similar to China Poblano's  shrimp mojo,  Paul ensured me they're total different dishes. He was right, very garlicky just the way I like it, )  Croquetas de pollo  (chicken fritters, served in a shoe, I think everyone is talking about this dish here, need I say more?) Costillas de cordero Moruno (rack of lamb, we ordered it medium rare, though it came out pinker than we expected, it didn't stop me from picking up the bones and chewing the meat off. Yes, I did that at Jaleo inside of Cosmopolitan!! ) Mini pepito de ibérico (Spanish mini Bugrer, a personal favorite of mine. My first time tasting Spanish ibérico pig. Fattening, yes, but trust me, it's worth the risk of getting your arteries clogged up. ) Paella Valenciana 'Rafael Vidal' (Chicken and rabbit paella, personally I couldn't differentiate the rabbit from chicken, but the paella itself was amazing, crispy and brunt.) Bacon wrapped dates (this dish was actually deep fried and served on an alioli-like sauce, tangy and sweet,) flan (Paul highly recommended this creamy flan, and it's beyond any flans we've ever tasted before. I especially love how it's served with mango sorbet, wiped cream and tangerines. Believe me, it works! ) and lastly, the olive oil ice cream (the rich olive oil with grapefruit sorbet plus chunks of grapefruit, citrusy and creamy at the same time.)  The ambiance in the restaurant was just simply romantic yet trendy, not to mention  é  the tasting kitchen is also located inside of Jaleo. I cannot wait until the next time when I visit Jaleo/Cosmopolitan again and try the famous é!!", "Date": "2014-12-31", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Nate", "ReviewID": "zeRR-wtQ-8A_YwIR2aFKYQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "This place is really an amazing stop.

I had been wanting to try it from the day it opened; the Iberico ham was calling my name!  My wife and I made our reservation through Opentable for Android and got right in at 630pm the day before Valentines. I immediately noticed that this was a  hipster  type of place with a modern feel; Wood floors and white tables without table clothes. The feeling was comfortable while retaining its coolness. If you are expecting a romantic, quiet, and private atmosphere this is not the spot for you.  The Menu is expansive and playful. Chef Andres' uses a nice sense of humor on his menu to get you to eat and drink! Most of the dishes are tapas style and this encourages sharing of course! We started with the Iberico Jamon bellota from the famous black footed pig! it's a little pricey at 22$ for five shaved slices, but go for it; you can't get this stuff in a supermarket.  Next, we ordered the Soupa De Ajo which is garlic soup with a 63degree Egg. They served it tableside and it was Soo garlicky and delicious! The croutons melted right in front of you as the hot soup hit them. The soup was soul satisfying!  Following the soup we had Dungeoness crab stuffed peppers. Tasty but not monumental. Then we got the foie gras and pork cannoli's in bechamel! Wow! Yummy! Topped with shaved black truffles this dish satisfies the biggest foodie! Rich and creamy and savory; everything you could want in a dish. We didn't think that our next dish of Veal cheeks could stand up, but the cheeks were out of this world! Luscious and tender you could eat them with your fork and served on the most wonderful olive oil potatoes you could ever want. The pork and the potatoes together were heavenly. This was our absolute favorite dish!  The night we were there the paella was made with Lobster. We went for it! As I said before, the chef is cute with his menu. So to me this seemed to be his signature dish. When you walk in to the restaurant you see a huge grill surrounded by UFO sized Paella pans.  I figured if you go to Jaleo then you have to try this dish. They tell you the paella takes about 45 minutes so it actually came out after our veal cheeks. Perfectly cooked lobster rested on top of the rice. This dish was all about the rice and the seafood with a yummy garlic aioli on the side. My only problem with the dish was that the Lobster was still in the shell. I have a problem with a place that serves lobster in the shell. I don't want to wrestle the damn thing to eat it. but it was a lovely dish and very good.  Our two desserts were well done and tasty but the dessert menu is short; only about 8 choices. Save some room and share like the rest of menu!  The service was very attentive! Our water glasses were never empty and there was never a pile up of empty plates. The table remained clean and cleared throughout the dinner. Our waitress, Michelle, was helpful in selecting a nice Rose Cava that went very well with all the food. Even on a busy night they were really on top of the service.  Overall I would recommend Jaleo to anyone who is into good food.

I'm not sure).  I guess I like my bread hot.  Chistorra envuelta en patata frita Slightly spicy chorizo wrapped in crispy potato.  Okay, this was tasty.  The potato helps to add texture to the dish.    Canelones de cerdo y foie con bechamel This dish had foie gras in the center, which provided a rich and creamy flavor.  Lomo de buey con Valdeón* Okay... here's my complaint.  This basically tasted like any random piece of meat.  It wasn't anything special.  Both the cooking and the meat quality seemed out of place.  Gambas al ajillo The shrimp was solid in terms of quality, but the sauce was a little underwhelming.    The sangria This was really sad... it tasted like sprite.  I was expecting great sangria, especially at a tapas restaurant.    So basically, a mix of good and mediocre dishes influenced me to be a little harsh.

Jaleo is located on the 3rd floor of the swanky Cosmopolitan Hotel.  The decor was very modern and sleek.  It's a nice place to dress up with your girlfriends and eat out.  Don't get me wrong, I don't mind shelling out top dollars for food but only if the food is worth it.  I understand that tapas are small plates but that doesn't mean you should provide us with toothpick size plates and charge us an arm and a leg.  We ordered the carne asada (grilled skirt steak) it was like 2 oz of meat and the charge was $18.00.  Um, maybe if it was waygu beef topped with some uni, okay that would be reasonable.

The pan con tomato, the gazpacho, so fresh and delicious.  My husband had some cheese (not a fan of cheese) - he loved it.  We went on the chorizo wrapped in a potato chip deep fried - YUM.  Then to the boneless chicken wings and carne asada.  Amazing flavors and textures.  For dessert we had the olive oil ice cream - I'm a sucker for anything olive oil - with grapefruit grenata.

Our server also recommended the hamburgesa de Iberico ($14), which is a grilled pork burger served with a cream sauce.  So tasty.  I think my husband inhaled this one.  The croquetas de jamon Iberico also very tasty and served in a cute little fry basket.  The paella is also excellent and changes daily.  This time they offered the lobster paella.

We were half full when we walked into the restaurant, but decided that we still have to try it because of my love for Paella.   There are 4 types of paella on the menu, but they only cook one every day, their  daily special . The one available on the day we went was the chicken and rabbit paella with green beans. Well, the chicken was a little too dry, but the rice was yummy and cooked well. The dish was executed well, but lets just say that it would have been my last choice order based on personal preference.  We also ordered the salmon tartare with salmon roe cone which was rather interesting to eat. One cone is definitely not enough, even for tapas sized servings :)  They had a special dish that day which was a slow roasted pork. We ordered that and it surely did not disappoint. The skin was nice and crisp, and the pork tender but not oily. It worked very well with the sauce too.  I have a weakness for Spanish flan, and their flan was easily the best I've ever had.

The restaurant was loud and crowded and we kind of got lost in the shuffle a few times.  The service was very spotty - sometimes they took away our plates before we had finished, and sometimes they left us sitting for way too long before checking on us. The server said she would put all our tapas in an order that made courses, but that made it so some people didn't have anything they wanted to eat for a course or two.  Also, our check did not come until we asked the manager to track it down for us.     In all, I would probably not return to Jaleo.  Part of the fun of tapas is enjoying the people you are with.

Friday night - place is hopping so we opt for the bar. Even the tables within the bar area are packed.   Our goal - 3-4 small plates, a drink then off to the next restaurant.   Bartender was very nice, attentive and shared her opinion on the favs. We basically sat in front of where they have the portion of the kitchen where they cook the paella over a wood pit - looked cool but how's the food ?   Ordered a 1/2 carafe of the sangria ( $18), the Pan con tomate and added the jamon iberrica ( total cost $15 ), Chicken Croquettes ( $10 ) , the bacon wrapped dates ( $8 ) and finally the lobster Paella ($23)   The sangria had a real earthiness to it - not what i would call the standard refreshing sangria. The bartender advised there was cinnamon and star anise in it. I liked it but it looked like a springtime drink that tasted like a fall drink.   they brought out the croquettes first ( would've preferred the pan tomato as the starter ) - the croquettes ( 5 of them ) were very good. it was like a high end Chicken ala King in a pastry that almost looked like a pizza bite.   The pan tomato was next with the dates. The dates ( again 5 of them ) looked like the chicken croquettes but of course, totally different in taste. I gotta admit, Firefly has them beat on the dates ! The pan tomato ( 3 slices of bread with tomato seasonings and then the ham ) simple but oh so good - the bread had a crunchy bottom yet an airy lightness above.   The only downer - about a 10 minute delay ( possibly a little more ) for the paella. The rice was amazing - full of flavor, definitely used a lobster stock within the rice. Two lobster claws , cracked, were included - decent flavor . I was kinda hoping for some Chorizo and a few other seafood nibbles - nope. Also, was there saffron ?

I have been to Bazaar (Jose Andres' restaurant in Beverly Hills) a few times so I kind of new what to expect. I would say I got pretty much what I expected.  The atmosphere is really nice. The Cosmo Hotel is very new and contemporary and Jaleo continues that feel. The restaurant is live and has a very fun, energetic atmosphere. There is an open-ness to the restaurant and it blends in with the rest of the hotel (so that you don't feel closed off).  The food (as with other Jose Andres restaurants) does not live up to the hype. The food is definitely not bad, but it is basically slightly above average. I love the tapas (small plates) style of eating, because you can try many dishes. And when you look at the menu, there are sure to be several things that look extremely appetizing.  The two of us had about 6 or 7 dishes. The cones filled with salmon sashimi and topped with salmon roe were very salty. I was expecting those to be better, they were just okay.  The Brussels sprout salad was pretty solid. We had a monk fish dish which was pretty good, it had a cilantro oil on it.  The bacon wrapped dates were very tasty. I have had bacon wrapped dates at many other restaurants, the difference here is that they were lightly breaded and deep fried. I though that was a nice touch. However, at other places bacon wrapped dates are stuffed with cheese (either a hard cheese like a Parmesan or sometimes a blue cheese). Here no cheese, and adding a nice Parmesan would kick it up a notch.  The veal cheeks were very good in my opinion.  We had a couple other salads including the lobster salad. Probably too much lettuce compared to the other goodies.  We also had the vegetable paella (which was the special) and it was pretty much vegetable paella. It was on the more expensive side (around $18) of the dishes and was not worth it. I would rather have had 2 more interesting dishes.  In the end, I would recommend this restaurant to others because the experience is worth it. The atmosphere and the unique dishes make for a fun time. Keep in mind, the dishes at this restaurant are not as  wild  as Bazaar where he uses several techniques some refer to as molecular gastronomy. But, the dishes are interesting and very palatable. Just don't go in expecting Michelin star quality food and you won't be disappointed.  Price is fairly reasonable for this type of setting. The dishes ranged from about $8 - $20 per dish.

Yelp! When will you give us half stars???!!!  I think 3.5 or 3.75 is more accurate for me.  I've been here three times now and have had vastly different experiences in terms of service and of food. I wouldn't go so far as to say the place is inconsistent (although that wouldn't be a surprise as it is in The Cosmopolitan-the Kings of Inconsistency), but the food flavors and preparation are vastly different from dish to dish. The price is sometimes off-putting for what you get; it is Vegas though...  If you go for dinner and want to order wine, the server will leave his ipad-wine list with you; it's cool. I still like someone who can discuss wines with me a bit more than our server could.  To keep it light and casual, Jim G. and I grabbed some snacks in the bar a couple times. That's how tapas is really done in Spain, anyway. Two different bartenders on the two nights we went. Both were cool, although one was slammed (and apparently short-staffed) so he was not the kindest; service was fine though.   During our dinner visit we tried the Monkfish: I strongly suggest you stay away from this dish!!! One of the best dishes I've had ever was monkfish in Paris, so I figured I'd give this dish a try. Oh My! It was fishy, it was sour-ish, it was not good. I mentioned that to the server; he was uninterested.  We also tried some paella; it looked so great cooking at the Paella station that we had to. I didn't think it was that awesome. It was done well, but the flavors were uninteresting to me.  Things that are good/ok: Gambas al Ajillo: Hard to do this one wrong; nice garlic/butter sauce Huevos Fritos con Caviar: If the egg were a bit less cooked and there was a dash of additional flavor or texture, this might have been perfect. Canelones de cerdo: Pork and Foie Gras canelones with bechamel sauce. This was good, but again, I expected bolder flavors. it could have been amazing, but fell short of that.  Ultimately, my review of Jaleo isn't stellar. What I do like is the energy in this place. I like the decor. I like what the Chef is trying to do. I think a lot of people will enjoy the less-than-traditional ingredients and the attempts at bold flavors. It's a blessing and a curse that I've eating amazing meals in fascinating places; I expect a lot. I would still prefer to be smashed up against a bar with slightly warm wine or Mahou beer enjoying the bold flavors if tapas in Madrid than in any of the US restaurants where I've tried tapas. They try, as Jaleo does, but the food still leans a bit too American for me.   You see why I'm torn?

Luckily there was no more delay to getting us seated at this busy, loud restaurant. Our waitress was very informative and was great at letting us know what was and wasn't available for the evening. Each dish arrived quickly and the presentation for each one was remarkable!  Croquetas de pollo (Traditional chicken fritters) - this arrived in a shoe. Yes - a shoe. Aside from the quirky presentation, the fritters were delicious - creamy and comforting, as if someone took a chicken stew and fried it up into fritter bits!  Bikini de jamón ibérico, queso Manchego y trufas (Pressed sandwich of ibérico ham, manchego cheese and truffles) - honestly, none of us said a thing while eating this. It was good, but we were probably expecting a little more. It felt too simple.  Caña de cabra con highs ((Murcia) A soft, semi-sweet goat's milk cheese paired with raisin walnut bread and fig jam) - I could've eaten a whole log of this cheese on a whole loaf of the walnut break with a whole jar of that jam.  Salmón crudo con huevas de salmón (Salmon tartare and salmon roe cone) - another favorite that stood out from the rest! Strong and fresh with a great combination of textures!  Arroz con costillas de cerdo ibérico de bellota Paella (Made with the ribs of the legendary, black-footed ibérico de bellota pigs of Spain) - This plate was meant for 2, but really it would be for 1. Luckily it was enough for all of us to get a good taste of the flavorful rice, mushrooms and pork!  The following were good and flavorful but not that exciting (in my humble opinion): Gambas al ajillo, Pollo a la parrilla con queso Valdeón y mostaza, Jamón serrano Fermín  We ordered enough and were stuffed!

The whimsical descriptions were bothering me and made  none of the descriptions clear. Our new waiter gave us a few recommendations and we chose to start with toasted slices of uniquely crispy bread and sautéed spinach with pine nuts, raisins, and apples. What does uniquely crispy bread even mean? Anyways both dishes were overly salted. The bread was a rendition of bruschetta and tasted soggy. Spinach could have been good with the combination of ingredients but once again all I could taste was salt in my mouth. After these dishes, I decided to not order anything else off the menu.   From the beginning the vibe was uncomfortable. Waiters and waitresses were standing around and talking while watching the dining room. The pig that they were displaying looked diseased.

Me and another girlfriend went to jaleo for dinner and all I can say is the service that we got from some white guy named Brian was horrible. We understand that being in the cosmo it was busy but he did not once ask us how the food was, and was too busy with the couple next to us. He was too occupied with getting more money out of that couple than giving us decent service. Our food came out relatively fast but everything that came out was bland. By the end of our meal we were craving some flavor, hoping to get dessert.. It took us 20 minutes to get our check and not only that he didn't even offer us a dessert menu.  We had gotten the shrimp al ajillo, the chicken fritters, the chorizo wrapped in potato, and the tuna salad. All were bland and the portions were minuscule to almost non existent. I know tapas are meant to be small, but jaleo took it to the next level.  I was furious when I left, the food was sub-par and the service was ridiculous. I would have complained to the manager if I wasn't in such a hurry to get out of the godforsaken place. I will never go back to jaleo, I'd rather go to firelfy where the service is decent to amazing and the food is always out of this world.

Enjoy the whimsical surroundings (Jaleo houses the legendary E, it's decor is an extension of that dining space, a foray into the mind of the chef).  Be prepared to sample molecular dishes alongside the traditional.  Most importantly, share some food, spill some wine on your face from the porron and have a great time.  Tip:  Order in flights (keep a menu).  Dishes are tapa style.  Ask your server the number of pieces on each dish.  All can be adjusted for the number in your party.  Tip:  Keep to Spanish dishes.  Steaks, lamb, pork can be had at Bazaar Meats, pure molecular gastronomy for E.  Save room for a paella.  To start, nice selection of cured meats (opt for the  chef's selection for the best variety).  Nice selection of cheeses however having the cheese as part of another dish is the way to go.  The Cabra goat cheese in endive with pine nuts and Clementine oranges is incredibly creamy and refreshing with a great acidic touch.  Don Bocarte Anchovies are excellent.  Canning Spain's great seafood is what Don Bocarte is about.  The whole fillets have great texture and salinity and oddly brightened by the olive oil.  Trust me, this isn't the stuff you spoon out of a can in college desperation days.  Gambas al ajillo (shrimp cooked in a garlic tomato broth).  The shrimp, plump and juicy.  Its sweetness accentuated by the acidic tomato sauce.  Garlic adds a creamy richness and gentle earthiness.  The crusty bread that accompanies it is the perfect way to sop up the goodness.  Grilled octopus is stunning.  Thick leg, tender with perfectly blistered and blackened skin adding a pronounced but pleasing bitterness.  Zesty olive oil mixed with a sweet onion puree adds sweetness.  Good as any.  Paella is the specialty and a must.  Cooked over a wood burning fire that imparts a gentle smoky bitterness.  The chicken and mushroom is excellent.  Tender, free ranged, thighs and an assortment of wild mushrooms amidst a rich mixture of moist, well flavored rice.  A streak of roasted garlic, lemon and olive oil supercharged aioli adds the richness and acidic peppery zing that has you yearning for more.  If you're lucky, and it's being made, ribs of the black footed Iberico pig or chicken and rabbit with tender green beans is a must order.  Service is very friendly and efficient.  Excellent wine list focusing on Spain.  Good by the glass selection.  Solid sherry selection and flights.  Think you got what it takes to have a great evening?

Yum!!!!! -Salt Codfish: this one disappointed. It just tasted like 'fried'- I expected a battered piece of fish, but instead it was a ball of fish mushed up with some other stuff, breaded then fried. Neither of us liked this. -Gambas Al Ajillo : apparently their most popular dish, but neither of us especially enjoyed it.

Five cheeses for twenty dollars that we nibbled on throughout the whole meal, seemed like a good deal to me. It was served with crusty bread with a delicious spread of crushed tomatoes. Did I mention I also love tomatoes?  I just happened to look right now at the Jaleo Washington DC menu and you get all six cheeses for 18 dollars. Grrrrr! haha, oh well. I've lived in DC and now in Vegas, and I guess this is the compromise I get for dining in a casino on the strip now. My favorite favorite favorite dish that we tasted was the fried organic egg topped with caviar! YUM! YUM! YUM! We also had the spicy chorizo wrapped in a thin potato! Which I thought was great, just the right amount of spice! Then there were the fried dates wrapped in bacon.....hmmmm. Served in a shoe!? YES! served in a shoe. I have a picture on my phone that I wish I could upload right now. I've never eaten out of a shoe before. But, if you can get past the bizarre notion, its actually quite funny (especially after three glasses of wine) and quite tasty! As far as meat goes, I didn't try any of the serrano ham, which I'll have to come back for. But, I loved the grilled hanger steak with piquillo peppers. It was sliced very thin, but still medium rare, and tasted amazing alongside the bread and cheeses. My least favorite was some other roasted red pepper dish, but obviously I can't even remember the ingredients so it did not impress. I was far too full for dessert, but instead enjoyed a cup of resh french press coffee to keep me going for the rest of the night.

Our waitress said that there was a chicken special that was so much better than the chicken wings so she would bring that instead. I did not object but I should have.   The tomato bread was yummy. $6 bucks.  The manchengo queso was an actual small slice of cheese with some dried fruit. I was thinking I was going to get some sort of yummy dip. Nope, a small piece of hard cheese. Wow Chef! Did they teach you that in culinary school?  I suppose queso does mean cheese in Spanish so it is my fault for assuming. $9 bucks  The cod empanadas were more like wontons to me. They were fried with pureed cod inside and honey drizzled on the outside. The taste was decent but the texture made me want to gag a little bit.   The boneless chicken wings. These chicken wings cost $18 dollars for 4 of them. While I was eating them, I was thinking.. These are not any better than Buffalo Wild Wings.  NOT IMPRESSED. If those were sooo much better than the other ones, I would have hated to taste those.   My husband ordered a glass of scotch and I ordered a bramble (house specialty drink).

There are really only a couple that are my  standards  that I always go to when I'm in town.    I spent a little time in Spain and fell in love with Tapas, but to me, Tapas is also an atmosphere and this is Vegas and its trendy and not as enjoyable as being in a small bar in Spain eating some great Tapas that were just made.  I'm used to the menu being written on a small chalkboard or on the wall and not a fancy menubook or a wine list on an iPad.  Nevertheless, there are some great dishes here worth trying. 1.  Olives/liquid olives - the kalamata liquid olive concoction was fun and tasty and we laughed when the little olive balls popped open.  As long as you like olives, you should get these. 2.  Veal cheeks - if you are weary about eating these, stop reading this, turn off your computer, and go get a plain ol' burger you loser...these were really awesome.  One of the girls in our party got really upset when the waitress took the plate and there was still a little bit of potato and sauce left in the bowl.  Bummer.  We shared this with a group of four and it was perfect because given the richness, any more than a couple of bites would have been overkill and there was more food to try.  But I would order this every time I come to Jaleo. 3.  Ham fritters - delicious.  Why would you want to get chicken here? 4.  Bacon wrapped dates - I get these whenever I see them on a menu and they were great here. 5.  Skirt steak - reminded me of when I was in Spain because a piece of skirt steak, with some roasted red peppers, and frites was a staple meal.  Would have been happy if I didn't have to share this one. 6.  Paella - it was the lobster one.  They make one large batch(of varying ingredients) every 45 minutes or so, so you can get the one just made hopefully, or wait a short while and get some after some other tapas.  We started out with this and it was just okay.  I would just rather order Paella at a restaurant that specialized in that, so you get the pan and a chance at the socarrat, because it was a little cold and just tasted okay.  If you don't know what socarrat is, google it...its important. 7.  Chorizo - tasted good but not wowed. 8.  Bread with tomato and Manchego - okay, but would rather have just had some Manchego by itself.    We did have a nice bottle of Albarino that ran about 100 bucks.  While Patatas Bravas is an absolute for me when I go out for Tapas, they don't make them the traditional way here and I appreciate our server letting us know that.  So we passed on those this time.  I would recommend swinging by for a little wine and a few tapas before dinner somewhere else(see above list/Top 5).  The restaurant smells fantastic which is almost worth a short visit in of itself.

A friend and I had reservations for a late (9 p.m.) dinner on a Saturday night. We were a bit late, but were seated promptly anyway. The place was PACKED ... and really, really loud. We were led to a small table near the back of the restaurant.  Service was prompt and our waiter, Mario, was friendly. He offered a few suggestions, and really seemed to be pushing the (pricey, $56) Arroz a banda con bogavante (AKA lobster paella). So we bit, along with an order of the Croquetas de pollo (chicken fritters served in a tennis shoe), a Berenjenas con miel de cañal estilo Malagueño (fried eggplant), and Vieiras con salsa de romesco (seared scallops), washed down with a half -carafe of the house sangria.   The server had warned us that the paella could take about a half hour to make and that we should prepared to wait. Meanwhile, he poured the sangria, which was absolutely yummy. Much to our surprise, the paella arrived within 10 minutes of ordering - ahead of the other dishes. Also surprising: It was barely warm, was full of charred bits and contained very little lobster (yes, there are three lobster parts presented on the plate, but they contained only a small amount of meat, which also seemed a bit undercooked). For $56, this was an absolute disappointment. We didn't even finish the dish.   The rest of the plates arrived within 15 minutes. The chicken fritters looked promising. But, when I bit into one of the piping hot finger-shaped fritters, I was met with a molten, smooth, tan filling inside. The only thing I can compare it to was the consistency of pureed, jarred baby food (and it kind of tasted like that, too). I actually had to wait for the fritters to cool down a bit, which firmed up the consistency and at least made them more palatable. But overall, they were just gross. Revolting, actually. I'm cringing as I write this just thinking about them again.   Same went for the eggplant: Lightly breaded (as the menu describes) they are not. The batter used to fry them was obviously thick, almost like a tempura batter (which is what the four, half-moon pieces looked like - puffy and large). Again, when hot, the eggplant was almost molten and oozed out of the breading. In no way did it resemble eggplant. Again, it firmed up upon cooling a bit, but was still sort of weird.   The scallops (all two of them, for $15) were pretty, but I'm not sure they were entirely cooked in the center. They felt kind of mushy, which was not appetizing.   By far, the best plate of the evening was dessert: Flan al estilo tradicional de mamá Marisa con espuma de crema Catalana (classic flan), which was one of the best interpretations of the dish that I've ever had. The flan was velvety smooth, reminiscent of panna cotta. It was garnished with a vanilla-bean whipped cream and a small scoop or orange sorbet. I could have eaten that all night.   But a woman cannot live on flan alone! Which is why I would not ever consider returning to this restaurant. The food was terribly disappointing. And unless you're into shouting your entire dinner conversation while feeling as though you're trapped in a sardine can, the ambiance leaves something to be desired.", "Date": "2012-07-29", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "Rg3MF_uHxyIfFcg0ZNxFDw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Excellent food (other than the patatas bravas).

I usually show up here alone when I'm in town on business, so I end up at either the tapas bar or the sangria bar. Some people have complained about the service here but I have found them unfailingly energetic and helpful, eager to guide newcomers through the menu. They're often crowded, so yes, servers do not always have a lot of time to hover, but I've never had anyone brush me off. And I always get the feeling they really enjoy the food they're selling and want you to enjoy it, too.  I have some special dietary needs, so I prefer small plates to the ginormous portions that a lot of people like and expect. And as a corollary, I don't have much use for hotel buffets. If you love the value and large portions of a buffet, Jaleo is probably not for you. But if you like smaller portions, you can get very happy at Jaleo.   Every dish I've had here has been good, and some are dizzyingly delicious, though some are unmemorable. The chicken croquettes -- served in paper tucked into a sneaker -- are comfort food elevated to Olympian heights. The combination of crunchy, creamy and salty will take you back to childhood, if your mother was a gourmet tapas chef. There's a bacalao dish that is similar. Their fennel and apple salad with mancheco is a healthy option that is way too tasty for being so good for you, rich with toasted nuts. On the other hand, the house smoked cheese with nut brittle would be a good pairing with a drink but is only okay as part of a meal.   I had one dessert that isn't on the online menu: torrijas, I think it's called. They describe it as a Spanish style French Toast, which doesn't quite convey what it is. It's like a creamy bread pudding with top note of citrus, maybe from a liqueur, served with brioche ice cream. It's not the best dessert I've ever had but right now I'm having trouble thinking of 10 better ones.   The atmosphere is loud and a little raucous. As befits its location in the hip, upscale Cosmopolitan, the vibe is, well, upscale and hip, energized, welcoming and bright. This is not a place for a quiet, sedate experience. It's very different from the darker, more romantic La Cave at the Wynn, which also serves small plates.   But here's the catch with Jaleo: Those small plates aren't cheap. They add up. And tapas, as everybody knows from watching Anthony Bourdain, are meant to accompany wine or beer. So if you show up very hungry and order 4-5 tapas/person plus drinks, dessert and coffee, I'd estimate you could be looking at $150-$200/person. I usually order 2-3 tapas and maybe dessert for around $50 before tip -- if I'm not drinking. I am generally satisfied with that, but as I said, I usually show up alone and I like to eat lightly.   Bottom line: A fun menu to explore, lots of soul-satisfying treats, but the price can sneak up on you. I can't honestly call the food a great value for the money, but I love the whole Jaleo experience: the energy, the young eager staff, the feeling of fun, even the bustle and noise. No, it's not a hotel buffet.

Our server was pretty rushed the whole evening and was not very attentive.    Unfortunately, the tapas are a real let-down.  We started with the lomo iberico (type of ham) and a selection of Spanish cheese.  Very small pieces and not served with bread.  We had to ask and pay for bread separately.  Who serves ham and cheese without bread.  In all the times we have had tapas, this had never happened.  Next we got the dates wrapped in bacon.  Incredibly salty.  Almost inedible.  The sauteed cauliflower was very good and the lone high point of the meal.  The mini pork burgers were pretty good but quite greasy.  The lamb skewer was so lemony it was hard to eat.  Finally the sauteed mushrooms were pretty good but a bit undercooked.  Like other reviewers have noted, the portions are small.  You could very well leave hungry like we did.

Even more disappointed by the fact that I watched a walk-in that had arrived AFTER my group and was seated before us (there were a few open tables we conveniently stood by that the walk-in's got). There's no question, the hostess just forgot about us. it wasn't until the bartender noticed our annoyance that he went and got us a table. Strike 1.  I love (and I mean LOVE) tapas. We ordered a bunch of traditional dishes, expecting them to be a little more traditional. The patatas bravas (that were around $14) was a bowl of potato chips w/ mayo & spicy tomato sauce on top of them. yes. POTATO CHIPS. This was highly disappointing. Strike 2.  Service was incredibly slow - we ran out of water and waiting over 30 minutes trying to get a refill. WOW. Strike 3.  Out of the dishes we ordered, I couldn't point to a single one that was better than the food at Julian Serrano (in Aria, just next door). And of all the dishes we ordered, all were more expensive than their counterparts at Julian Serrano. None of it tasted bad, I just can't justify the price for the taste.

For example, the staple of tapas restaurants, the patatas bravas -- hard to describe, but included not only the traditional tomato-based sauce, but also a sort of creme part -- you'll see it when you try. But the real standout was the ensalada rusa. My dining companion, a Spanish literature PhD who has lived in Spain for months at a time, said it was the best she'd ever tasted.   Excellent food and excellent service. But there was another aspect of the dinner that I have to comment on.  On a Saturday night in midsummer, being at this restaurant is not just a dining experience, but a theatrical experience as well. As anyone who goes to Las Vegas on a weekend quickly realizes, it's sort of like Comic-Con if Comic-Con were about cisgendered displays: everyone is in a costume, of sorts, that emphasizes the degree to which they feel they best express their gender identity. And this was just as true at this restaurant as on the sidewalks of the Strip. Seated in the dining area were a number of pre-bridal parties of all men and all women, each displaying to the max their gender certifiers and clique behaviors. One party of 16 women seated at a long table, headed by a young woman in a bridal veil (!) wearing a freaking BANNER that said  BRIDE-TO-BE,  was described by my dining companion as  the Last Supper staged as a quinceañera.  Watching them gab to one another, take pictures and selfies, stare at their phones for the results, give each other fond (or cutting) looks, was fascinating. This was merely the largest party of costumed youths.

Chef José Andrés' delivers, as promised, in this Cosmopolitan Las Vegas-based branch of the original Metro Washington DC location, which has earned respect as a local institution.   You might have caught a glimpse of the chef in the Travel Channel's Washington DC episode of No Reservations featuring his exclusive artsy haunt: Minibar.  The chef not only has an incredibly passionate streak for quality ingredients, but he truly shines in culinary innovation and personality while providing an undeniably eclectic ambience that perfectly compliments the menu.           The spirit of Spain is infused into every detail without coming across with the superfluous kitsch one may discover at any Strip establishment.   While often busy, and almost impossible to have a quiet conversation, Jaleo offers a dining experience filled with enough energy to keep your attention without pushing you into sensory overload.      Jaleo, in short, offers a remarkable mixture of tapas, as well as the expected paellas, a noteworthy selection of Spanish wines, cocktails with character, and a kick-ass sangria.      Additionally, you will be greeted by enthusiastic and knowledgeable staff with terrific, and timely, presentation.  Created in 1993 by Chef José Andrés, Roberto Alvarez, and Rob Wilder, Jaleo has not only made a name for itself in DC, but it is slowly coming-of-age as a formidable competitor in the Las Vegas dining scene.  Be warned, Jaleo packs enough fiery punch to knock out any other tapas joint in Las Vegas.

The ambiance is a very relaxed atmosphere, with the staff welcoming to the trendiest of clientele as well as to the fanny-pack-toting tourists. There are 3 kitchens, including one huge wood fired stove for the paella (which is absolutely divine, worth the 45 minute wait). If you're not sure what to get, the staff asks you about your tastes to give you solid recommendations.  Here's what we had with our sangria: - watermelon salad (trust, you'll never look at watermelon the same) - the blue cheese, pear and raisin plate - the lomo (which was so good we had it twice) - the garlic shrimp (also had a second round, and dipped just about everything else we ordered in the sauce) - embutido (by itself) - embutido (on bread with cheese - a nicely salted pork pizza) - the paella with ribs (they only make two types a night but you can order one of the others if you're okay with ordering a huge pan for your table) - chicken fritters which looks like coquettes but tastes like chicken pot pie, served in a shoe (yes, that says shoe - it's the chef's homage to a famous athlete) - flan (super good, I'd come back just for this) - chocolate mousse   Everything we had was incredibly well seasoned, with no one taste overcoming the other flavors.

The cocktail was really good, maybe too good. Was there any alcohol in there? I'm not sure but for reason I would order it again.

I consider it to be one of the best restaurants i've ever been to! I was beyond excited to try Jaleo. It came highly recommended and I had fun imagining the crazy thing Jose Andres could do with Spanish tapas.  What we got was so disappointing! To start off, the ambiance of this restaurant sucks. It's loud and the chairs are super uncomfortable. It's not a  dressy  place at all, it doesn't even feel like a  nice  place. The people sitting next to us looked like they had come right from the pool and overall the vibe was super casual.  Service was spotty at best, except that 3 times they tried to take away our dishes when there were still several bites left. Excuse me!  The food was fine. It wasn't bad. There was nothing amazing or creative about this food at all, just your standard Spanish Tapas.  The only thing that was unique was the fact that they served chicken fritters in an old shoe. When we asked the waitress about the significance of the shoe she just said ,  I get asked that so much. The only thing we can think of is that Jose doesn't like plates . It felt so gimmicky!    For 2 people, I would order 5-8 Tapas to feel full.    With the plethora of AMAZING other places to eat in Vegas and in the cosmopolitan hotel, Jaleo is not a place I would waste my time eating.   **EDIT** I asked Jose Andres on twitter why he served the chicken fritters in a shoe and he replied!

Unfortunately the first time we went our favorite dish was not offered during lunch so we left. Six months later we made a return and were not disappointed this time.  Jaleo serves tapas style dishes which means the servings are small and several orders should be made for each person to be full. The menu is huge with chesses, salads, meats, etc. there is plenty to pick from.  Hands down this is their best dish: Croquetas de pollo   These are fried fritters with creamy chicken inside served in a shoe that shows Andreas' playful spirit. Once you have these you will ask for another and another serving they are that delicious.  We also had Patatas Bravas which are small slices of potato with aioli on top and a tomato sauce on the bottom. Chistorra envuelta en patata frita which were slightly spicey chorize sausages wrapped in a crispy potato skin. Cana de cabra con higos which were red peppers stuffed with goat cheese with a jam. I have to say the cheese was a bit bitter on this one. Finally we finished with Pollo a la parrilla con queso Valdeón y mostaza which was a perfectly grilled piece of chicken with a nice mix of herbs, mustard and lemon The sauce was delicious and the lemon added a nice citrus taste as well.  The Las Vegas Jaleo showed that there is great quality control as it tasted just as good as the Washington D.C. branch.

It's not that the concept isn't intriguing. Tapas restaurants are an excellent concept which can provide fantastic flavor combinations and lots of options for customers to choose from. When you're traveling with a group, it's great to order several tapas and share.  I also want to be clear that I think the staff at Jaleo was top notch, friendly, and timely. I appreciated that on a busy Thursday night.  The problem with this place wasn't the concept or the service. The problem was the food.  I went with a group of six people and personally tried 5 different tapas during the course of the meal. We would have ordered several more if the food wasn't so underwhelming.  What I tried:  The  pan de cristal con tomate fresco,  which was $12, was some dry, stale bread with what tasted like a can of tomato sauce dumped on top. It was sloppy. It was flavorless.  The  croquetas de pollo  ($12), were served in a shoe. Literally, the food was in a paper cone that was place inside of an old shoe. Why would anyone think that's clever or appetizing? The croquetas were decently cooked, but still lacked flavor.  The  gambas al ajillo  ($16), were flavorful, but the portion size was minuscule for a $16 dish.  The  remolacha con cítricos  ($12) was drenched in the dressing, though it wasn't bad otherwise.  The worst of it all, in my view:   José's patatas bravas  ($6) was seriously a individually-sized bag of potato chips (you know, the one they'd sell for $0.50 in a vending machine) covered in mayo and sriracha. They even took up a third of the plate with the empty bag cut in half, as if that was something that would impress a diner. The chips weren't great (most of them were crushed), and the sauce combination was fine, but this was an embarrassing thing to have on the menu in my view. An absolute shame.  The consensus about this place from those of us who had dinner that night and tried tapas other than those I listed was that it was the worst meal we had in our weeklong stay in LV.  I'm by no means someone who expects to have a five star meal every time I go out, and I understand the Vegas expense is always higher than it is other cities. I also understand that in a busy shift, some meals don't always turn out as well as they should. But the fact that all of the tapas we ordered had serious flaws is indicative of a systemic issue in the restaurant.  My disappointment in this meal compelled to share this experience.

Alright, now that I've put that disclaimer out there, onward with my review.  This place is in the uber-trendy Cosmopolitan Hotel.  It's tapas-style, Spanish fare.  The menu is pretty large and diverse - there's a little something for everybody, including cheeses, hams, soups, salads, various types of meat, vegetarian offerings, paella, you get the picture.  You should be able to find something you'll like.  We (my husband and I) started out with a beet salad, liquid olives, and chorizo sausages wrapped in sliced potato.  Not sure if the liquid olives are authentic Spanish or more of a gimmick, but interesting, nonetheless.  Beet salad was pretty standard, but good, and the potato-wrapped chorizo sausages were very good.  Next we decided to order the octopus and something that was advertised as a pork sausage stew.  This was my first time trying octopus, and I enjoyed it well enough.  The pork sausage stew was really just pork meatballs with sauteed mushrooms and pearl onions - I wouldn't call it a  stew.   It would have been quite tasty, actually, but the meatballs were WAY oversalted.  We had wine with our meal, but the cocktails looked quite good.  The atmosphere of this place was okay, but there was something about it that made me feel like I was at a restaurant in a mall.  Maybe it's the way the front of the place is wide open to the  commons  area outside, I don't know.  Other than that, it's lively and bustling inside, just as you would expect a tapas-style restaurant to be.  The service was okay.  Our server was attentive, but she didn't seem to happy to be there.  Every time she came over, she plastered on the fakest smile you can imagine (think the really angry girl from the movie  Waiting ).  At one point, she came over, turned her back on us to whisper something to the busser at the table next to us, who then proceeded to come and wipe our table down.  I really don't know what she said - at best it came off kind of rude, at worst it felt like it was something negative about what pigs we were.  I also overheard some other servers right behind us bitching about other customers.  Might want to save that gossip for behind the kitchen door!  All in all, decent food, decent atmosphere, bizarre experience with the waitstaff.

So perhaps this was the motivation for me finally trying one of his restaurants on my most recent trip to Vegas. Or maybe it's just that I really, really like Spanish food. Or both. I think it's both.  Anyway, I rounded up five food-loving dining companions and together we ventured into Jaleo on one fine Saturday night just after my 30th birthday. We were seated quickly and given iPads on which to choose drinks. I see the reason for doing this (because the wine list we were presented was a lot different than the one on the web site, so it seems they do a lot of updating), but none of us could really get it to work right (and at least half of the folks at the table own their own iPads). I think I accidentally turned the thing off two or three times. But after some fumbling, we successfully ordered our wines. I wish I could tell you what I shared with my fiance, but it is not listed on their website. So I can tell you it was dry, white, and awesome.   Next, onto the food! We were six very hungry people and we ordered many, many things of supreme deliciousness. The canelones were the highlight for me, primarily because of the perfectly browned manchego cheese on the top. Heavenly, you guys. Some other things that were particularly ASTONISHING:  - the veal cheeks - the bacon wrapped dates (I know this is on every menu, but the fact that they were fried made them at least 50% better than any others I've had). - the stuffed piquillo peppers (though the ones at Julian Serrano are still better; don't tell José I said that) - the sliders (get the Iberico bacon!)   We ordered the olives and one of my friends really didn't care for the liquid olives, but the rest of us approved of the FLAVOR EXPLOSION. Nothing else missed for anybody.   Service here was just fantastic. Our waiter was super helpful with lots of recommendations, and was able to help us figure out how many orders of each thing to get. I really liked how they paced out the tapas. At a lot of other small plates spots, I sometimes feel inundated because everything seems to come out at once. Here they made it so that we were able to enjoy one or two dishes at a time, and I really appreciated that.   Yeah, everything is expensive here, but you're on The Strip. We were all quite full for about $80/person, which is well into special occasion range, but totally worth it.

This is Vegas. Everything is overpriced. The sooner you realize that, the sooner you can accept it, move on, and enjoy yourself. Considering everything on the strip is overpriced, Jaleo really isn't that pricey.  2. You're at a TAPAS restaurant. Everything is small plates. That's the point. Don't expect a huge, Hash House portion of jamón ibérico and croquetas, and you won't be disappointed. The whole idea is to order a bunch of small plates and share among friends. It's social! It's fun!  3. This is a a José Andres place. Andres is into molecular gastronomy and generally screwing around with food to make it fun, playful, whimsical even. Croquetas in a shoe? Bring it on! And please, like the health department would let them use worn shoes? Come on.  I went for my birthday dinner with my best friend, and it was awesome. I'll admit I have a bit of a culinary crush on José Andres, so I was preconditioned to love it, but it really was great. Loved the sangria, the croquetas were practically orgasmic, the dates were magical, and that was hands down the best damn flan I've ever had in my life. And I'm a big girl--I've had my share of flan over the years. The patatas bravas aren't traditional--they really are like thick chips--but they still taste like the real thing.   None of these things is necessarily  revolutionary , but they're really effing tasty.  Our waitress was great, but the kitchen staff forgot about one of our dishes, so it took forever. (No matter, I'm a fan of the slow meal.) Another busser brought us someone else's croquetas by mistake, but our waitress let us have them anyway.  Well, someone screwed up, but they're on the house, so enjoy!  The kicker is that in my mango sorbet, I found a tiny piece of plastic that came from the container they stored it in. Lucky for Jaleo, I'm pretty hard to piss off in a restaurant. I told the waitress, she brought the manager over--the GM, not the shift manager, he explained what happened, I said it was cool (I'd also had a fair amount of that delicious sangria), then when we got the check, they'd knocked off a more than decent portion of it for all the tiny hiccups.  Hiccups aside, it was a great meal. I'll be back, but with more people so we can try everything on the menu. It's casual, but classy.

With arbor-infused blanc tequila, bay leaf syrup, lime and a sherry salt rim, this drink will kick start your flavorful ride the right way!  The menu is loaded with endless Spanish tapas and paellas options. One item that blew my mind was the mini pepito de ibérico, which is a Spanish mini burger made from the legendary, acorn-fed, black-footed ibérico pigs of Spain with ibérico bacon. Absolutely one of the best tapas i've ever gotten to enjoy! A soft buttery bun and tender meat this bite is filled with different flavors guaranteed to satisfy you.

We were a little wary due to some negative reviews, but we went ahead and gave it a shot. Mostly because they have a foosball dining table. Let me just say...I don't know what all the negative yelpers were talking about! There is no way this is the same restaurant you guys went to.  The service was great. Our server really was super helpful in our decision making. Especially the important stuff like, should we get the small or large sangria? Which, by the way, was pretty tasty. I'm not a sangria snob, I don't care if they're  supposed  to make it a certain way. It was good, end of story.  We each started off with salads. Manzanas con hinojo y queso Manchego for me. Borderline amazing. The only thing that kept me from being in love with it was that it either had not enough cheese, or too much salad. I'm going with not enough cheese. He had a brussels sprout salad. I was not interested in that at all. I hear it was lovely.  I moved on to the Carne Asada, and he went with Chistorra envuelta en patata frita, which is basically glorified pigs in a blanket. But really yummy. My carne asada was absolutely delicious. The only negative is that it was a little less done than I typically like my meat. I had to put the roasted peppers on top so that I wouldn't have to see the bloodiness as I was eating it. I don't eat piglets, so I can't speak for his dish. But I did break off a piece of potato. It was like eating the best Lays chip ever made.  Time for dessert! Always my favorite part. We shared a flan. It doesn't sound like much, I know. But it was topped with a mandarin orange sorbet and some kind of cream which I can only assume was infused with crack. And I want more.  The biggest disappointment of the night was that we didn't get the foosball table.

The kitchen was out of most items, granted it was a late dinner, but the waiter made an offhand remark about us coming late, and came after we were served to tell us that the item we asked about on the menu had come back to life.   The food came dry, not at all fresh, and clearly left for at least an hour after it's even made. The tapas were overpriced and the sizes were small even for tapas.

I consider myself to be somewhat of a José Andrés fangirl so I was naturally looking forward to dining at Jaleo.  Needless to say, my expectations were not met.  The food itself was decent.  Not quite as inventive as The Bazaar's offerings but with the lower price point, that's to be somewhat expected.  Service, however, was horrifically below a restaurant of Jaleo's caliber.  When my party was seated, the waiter proceeded to give us the  key dishes you should try  shtick including the many varieties of paella that the establishment is famous for.  Okay sold.  We try to order the paella only to be told that we can't do so because we have a party of four and the menu states that you must have a party of six or more.  Uh, okay.  Then why did you just spend all that time raving about your paella?  We then ask if it would be at all possible to check if there were any other tables ordering any of the paellas that we could combine ordering forces with because we really wanted to try the paella.  Our waiter flat out rejects us without even bothering to check.  Now I understand that there's a certain protocol to be followed and I wasn't necessarily expecting an exception but would it have been so hard to double-check (pretending to check would have been more than sufficient)?  Oh and here's the delightfully irking kicker: OUR SERVER WAS WRONG.  While dining at é by josé andrés this past weekend, the infinitely more gracious and knowledgeable waitstaff notified me that every night, Jaleo makes a paella of the day for the entire restaurant to order individual portions from; the six or more limit only applies to parties who want to order a paella of their choice.  A waiter who's clueless about the menu at an upscale(ish) restaurant?  For shame.  Following the paella debacle, I excused myself from the table so I could surreptitiously notify our waiter that one of the girls in my party was celebrating a birthday and that I'd like to surprise her with a dessert.  I couldn't find the waiter so I told the busboy who had been helping our table who in turn said he would pass along the message to our waiter.  While giving us our dessert menus, our waiter proceeds to ruin the surprise by saying,  and are we celebrating a birthday today?   I wouldn't expect this kind of a misstep from a T.G.I. Fridays let alone Jaleo.  Had service been passable, I would have rated Jaleo at a solid 3.5 stars.

The service is unbeatable as they bring items quickly and are attentive. As it is a tapas place, the items come as they are ready.

There was an asparagus dish with yet again too much mayo.   There were sliders at $9/each that sound amazing on the menu but come with items on it not listed in the menu that impact/overwhelm the flavor: caramelized onions and two different peppers.

The food is absolutely delicious, the plates are small (tapas style) so you get to try a lot of different things, and it has a non-stuffy, fun pre-going-out vibe. One of the tables is even a foosball table! I'm actually really surprised some of the reviews rate Jaleo so low...I've never been disappointed with a dinner there.  I ate there most recently last Friday night at 9pm with a table of four. Here are some of the foods we ordered that I can remember:  salmon cones - these are an absolute must, probably my favorite item on the menu! They come with salmon roe on top too.  carne asada - my first time ordering this. we saw it on the table next to us and it was absolutely as good as it looked. cooked medium rare on top of peppers  chicken fritters - also our first time trying this. it's not something I would normally order, but we saw our waitress walking through the restaurant carrying a shoe! We asked her what we had to order to have our food served in a shoe, and the chicken fritters it was. They were good, but not stand-out.  mussels - I'm not generally a huge mussels fan, but I love these! Served on ice in the shell with an awesome marinade on top  sliders - delicious! definitely order the iberico ham on top, and I suggest asking them to leave the aioli off  ham and manchego grilled cheese - self-explanatorily awesome  cheese course - I can't remember the types of cheeses we ordered (the top three on the menu) and all of them were fantastic. they don't serve the cheese with bread or crackers, but they'll bring you bread if you ask! or you can order the bruschetta which is delicious as well  Unfortunately, they had removed the pork and foie gras canelones from the menu, but we were told it's a seasonal item and will be coming back! :)  I wish I remembered our servers name because she was really nice and attentive, without being obnoxious about it. When my sister wasn't sure which drink to start with, she let her sample a few wines and then brought her a cocktail with Bramble in the name. (I cannot recommend that drink enough - it tastes like berries and cucumber!) For the four of us, our bill came to about 650, but a lot of that was alcohol.

I had a fantastic lunch here on my last day in Vegas. Originally planning on going somewhere else in the Cosmo for lunch, we instead ended up here and it was a perfect choice. Not that we were surprised - it's Jose Andres, after all.  The lunch menu offers a $26 prix fixe menu of salad, gazpacho and a choice of paella of the day or sandwich(es) of the day; there is also a fantastic a la carte selection of cured meats and other small dishes; and of course, no tapas meal is complete without a pitcher of sangria (which quickly escalated our lunch to well over $100 for two).  The paella that day was a chicken and mushroom, which at first I was skeptical of. My heart is very loyal to seafood paella, but I gave this a shot and it was outstanding. The chicken (all dark meat) was tender and juicy, the rice was cooked to perfection and with rich flavors, and the whole thing was served with a garlic aoili that was spread across half the plate. Yummmm.  For the sandwich option, there were three to choose from. We opted for the chorizo/tomato sandwich and it, too, was a winner. Light, crispy and flavorful, served with Jose Andres' own pink himalayan salt potato chips.   From the a la carte menu, we were tempted to order a few dishes, but knew our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. There was plenty of food already for the two of us, but we had to try a little something extra.  We went with the endives and oh. my. goodness.  The endives/goat cheese/orange/almonds dish might've been the single most refreshing combination of flavors I've tasted all year. I could've had 10 orders of that and called it a day.  For dessert, we had the flan. I prefer a simple, traditional flan, but still ate every bite of this creative take on it. It was served with orange slices, a sorbet and a whipped creamy something. No complaints here!  I love when a meal - unplanned and unresearched - delights and surprises.

I was pleased with what I had. It kind of made me miss home more, so I don't know if it was a good idea haha Me and my friend had the lunch menu, which came with a salad, gazpacho (typical chilled tomato soup), and paella. The salad was just a regular salad, but both the gazpacho and the paella were really good, the closest I've had that tasted like home since I was last there. We also had as appetizers some manchego cheese and lomo iberico. Everything was really good in Jaleo, but there is a downside: the price.

My bestie wanted tapas for her birthday and we decided on Jaleo since none of us had tried them yet. It was pretty easy to get a reservation for Thursday at 9:30. I was thinking it'd be a bit busier because it was leading up to fight weekend but nope! They had a normal steady flow of people.  Ambiance is cute, a nice place to catch up with friends or family. The atmosphere didn't feel stuffy at all. However, I will say that the spacing between courses felt a little bit too long and when the food came out, all of them could have been a bit warmer. They all were lukewarm.  As for service, our server was nice, however, he did not offer explaining the menu, did not ask if it was our first time or even talk about the portion sizes. The only thing he did mention was specializing in Gin & Tonic variations on an iPad lol which were $20 each! The menu is very extensive and a bit confusing since all the dishes' names aren't in English! I wish he'd mention what his favorites were. I also saw $55 & $85 chef tasting options available, which I'd like to come back to try.  Cítrico Gin & Tonic $20: Oxley gin, Fever-Tree Mediterranean tonic water, grapefruit, lemon, coriander, mint. The birthday girl got this one but we all got to taste it and geeze, I've had better G&Ts from PT'S! Everyone agreed that no one could taste anything except for the tonic water. We really could not taste ANY of the supposed grapefruit, lemon, etc. And for $20? The flavor should be better than $17 specialty cocktails at the Chandelier Bar. 0/5  Dátiles con tocino 'como hace todo el mundo' $14: Fried bacon-wrapped dates served with an apple-mustard sauce. These were okay, very underwhelming. I'd rather go to Firefly and have their bacon wrapped dates any day. The bacon tasted a little charred and the dates weren't sweet. The mustard sauce was okay, nothing special. 2/5  Mini pepito de ibérico* $8 EACH!: Spanish mini burger made from the legendary, acorn-fed, black-footed ibérico pigs of Spain with ibérico bacon. These were really good! Super flavorful, soft buns and very tender! However, at $8 EACH?! What?! They're not THAT amazing, expecially for how small they were. 4/5  Rossejat' negra con Cigala $27: Toasted pasta, squid ink, sepia sofrito, Norwegian lobster and alioli. This one was my  favorite  but again there were some big issues that shouldn't be in a $27 dish. Half of the squid ink pasta was burnt onto the pan that it came in, I know this definitely only had enough to split by 2 people but between the 4 of us, we got basically a tablespoon of squid ink pasta each. Also the body of the super skinny Norwegian Lobster was cut in half but left the claws with no cut so we couldn't even get in them! Flavor was alright but I'll go to RX Boiler Room for his squid ink entree instead for larger portion and more developed flavors. 3/5  Arroz con costillas de cerdo ibérico de bellota $36: Basically the Paella with the pig ribs. I was super excited for this one but was very disappointed. Rib meat was not tender, more on the dry and chewy side and as for flavor, meh. 2/5  Salmón crudo con huevas de salmón $5/cone: Salmon tartare w/ salmon roe on top. These were super good! 4/5  Overall, I still feel bad giving a not so great review after seeing so many people love this place but the whole experience for us was pretty underwhelming and forgettable for basically all areas: specialty drink, food, and service.

If you had told me before we left that my wife would eat foie gras or veal cheeks, I would have laughed in your face.  Now I can't say that.  She did eat that and she liked it!  Let's start at the beginning.  We had an early reservation at 5 PM and as soon as they opened, the hostess came and got us as we people watched at the Cosmo.  We were seated in the area a few steps up from the main floor.  Our server was Donny and he was top notch!  He talked us through some possibilities after we studied the menu for awhile.  First, we ordered white asparagus with Idiazabal cheese.  The cheese was shredded so finely and had such a good flavor that it was a beautiful topping for the asparagus.    Next we each had soup--me gazpacho and my wife the Black garlic soup.  Both were very good!    This was followed by Ground pork and foie gras cannelloni and boneless chicken wings.  By now, my wife was getting into the tapas idea and the sharing part and we each enjoyed the dishes.  The Béchamel sauce on the cannelloni was a superb addition to the delicate cannelloni that were filled with very good ground pork and foie gras--and yes, she ate the foie gras and liked it!  One last main dish to share was the veal cheeks with morels.  It was excellent and the veal was fork tender.  On to dessert--I ordered the Chocolate hazelnut cake with praline ice cream and my wife ordered the rice pudding with vanilla and cinnamon with a lemon sorbet.  The cake was rich, dark chocolate and decadent--just the way I like my chocolate!  The rice pudding was very good.  My wife thought the sorbet was too sour but I disagreed thinking it was a great counterpoint to the mild sweetness of the pudding.  Service was excellent throughout the dinner.  Bus people did their jobs efficiently, more iced tea was brought, Donny came around to suggest we might want to order our hot foods so the flow of the meal would not be interrupted and he had recommendations for us when we asked and he was spot on with them!

Unless you read the English description.  Well, as I said before, I have no patience to read every description to settle on a handful of openers.  Which sucks because we ended up with the cod empanadas, which, oh, btw, doesn't really have any cod in it.  It's basically a fish cream that's been deep fried in thin and crisp empanada shell with some honey drizzled on it.  You might like it and love it, but my friends and I could not stomach this to save our lives.  We Fear Factored the shmuck who ordered it as punishment.  Yes, he smelled like fish after that.  The menu doesn't suck if you read Spanish.  Or you have the patience to actually read everything.  Deal killer?  Nope, because...  ...I pester people to give strong recommendations.  Sucks for everyone else except me!  Using this method, we stumbled across a ginfully good Gin & Tonic.  They ship their ice sphere (don't call it a ball) from their sister ship in LA.  Seriously.  The care and attention that goes into this one drink suggests that they care about all of their products (apparently even that cod cream).  Speaking of attention, the food in the shoe definitely grabbed ours, as we promptly ordered the delectable pollo croquetas (sp?) that occupy the footwear.  Those little morsels of what tasted like really good creamed chicken in a crunchy fried shell are really yum.  Another great recommendation was that we try their off-menu paella (I don't know what it's called because we said we'd take it before the server even described it).  To our surprise it was loaded with a whole lobster tail, a giant lobster claw (a bitch to break open), a few prawns and a few muscles.  Killer good that dish, but...  ...not as good as the Iberico Short Rib Paella recommended on my first visit.  It was so rich and tasty that we wanted another plate.  I daydream about it.  I drool uncontrollably.  My second visit to Jaleo was specifically to have this dish again.  Upon sitting, before ordering drinks or even water, we asked for, nay DEMANDED this paella.  To which our humble server replied they were not going to be making it.  At all.  For the rest of the night.  Once the tears stopped, I pulled myself together with a wonderful Gin & Tonic, had some pretty good dishes (like the potato wrapped chorizo and roast quail) then went over to Blue Ribbon for oxtail fried rice to dull the pain...but that's for another review.    Yeah, Jaleo, you've got a lot going for you.  Your food's mostly good.  But I think I need Rosetta Stone and some valium to get through the menu.  And you need to get some more damn Iberico short ribs for the best paella in the world!", "Date": "2012-08-14", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Addy", "ReviewID": "VO8ojp_FIgSFT1UjEmQ_vQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I can't decide whether to give this place 3 or 4 stars.  I guess I will round it up.  Jaleo is the place my boyfriend took me for our anniversary.  We came here on 7/25 for dinner.  PAN DE CRISTAL CON PASAMONTES MANCHEGO $12 Delicious.  Really authentic light and crispy toast with a fresh tomato paste and a slice of thin manchego cheese.  Just wish we could have gotten more for the price.  CROQUETAS DE POLLO $12 My favorite.  Delicious croquetas with chicken.  They even came in a little shoe.  Strange, but definitely interesting.  Only 5 in an order.  CALAMARES A LA ROMANA $12 Eeek.  Well this popped my food-sending-back cherry.  As a server, I have never sent back food.  But even my boyfriend couldn't eat this and we both love calamari.  It was extremely chewy/rubbery which means it was overcooked.  BUNUELOS DE BACALAO $14 Yum!! I couldn't get enough of this.  I didn't really know what to expect when ordering this so I was surprised when it came out.  It is like little fried balls of creamy codfish.  The honey aioli was so good.  Very rich flavor.  PAPAS ARRUGAS $8 How can you go wrong with potatoes? Yum.  CARNE ASADA CON PIQUILLOS JULIAN DE LODOSA $18 So good.  Cooked perfectly.  MINI PEPITO DE IBERICO $8 I thought my boyfriend was going to die happily once he bit into this.  His favorite part of the meal.  We also ordered a sangria ($12) and a cocktail ($16).  I'm going against the odds and saying I did not like the sangria.  I felt like I was back in high school and had to plug my nose, down this, and then chase it with my water.  I don't remember which cocktail my boyfriend ordered, but when it came out I was very confused.  It literally looked like a SHOT.  Not a cocktail, but a shot.  There must have been 2-4 oz at MOST.    The service was okay.  We had a really hard time finding our server to tell her about the calamari/get our check.  She took it off our bill without a problem, which we appreciated.  So all in all: I would come back.  But maybe on a half full stomach.  The portions are way smaller than tapas.  Some are bite sized.  And it is extremely overpriced.  Our bill was $120ish and we were still hungry.  Not a good feeling to pay this much and leave hungry.  We were highly considering going to get a slice of pizza at Secret Pizza but had a show to go to. (Which we wouldn't have been late to if it didn't take our server 15 minutes to drop the check).

If you're in LA, check it out -- I think it's even better than Jaleo.  On the pricey side - I believe for about 5-6 tapas and some sangria it was around $125.

To order drinks you the waiter gives you an ipad to look up all their selections. The app was very easy to use and ended up being handy versus gimmicky. The Cuba Libre was one of the best  rum/coke  drinks I've ever had. With a cinnamon stick, bitters, and a giant sphere ice cube served in a red wine glass it was as beautiful as it was tasty. My date had the Jaleo bramble which because of the cucumber water and berry puree tasted very fresh.  On to the food!  Patatas Bravas (fried potatoes): A simple dish, but one of the best. Nicely fried with a delicious red sauce and aioli . These disappeared very quickly.  Gambas al Ajillo (shrimp with garlic sauce): The sauce on this dish rocked my world. Garlicky of course, but with a very deep flavor. We both wished for bread to get some more of the sauce.   Rape Donostiarra (monkfish with sherry): Very thinly sliced monkfish, which tastes similarly to lobster. Light sherry/olive oil sauce which was mild to let the taste of the fish through.  Mejillones Vapor (mussels with lemon and olive oil): Mussels were very little and the ones that weren't gritty tasted excellent. Sauce was very buttery, but went well with the mussels.  Setas al Ajillo (wild mushrooms): Hen of the woods mushrooms with a side of mashed potatoes. Really liked the potatoes, but the mushrooms tasted like mushrooms with nothing on them.

We experimented with how tiny a bit we could dissect out and still get the wow: almost invisible bits still sparking savory deliciousness.   Paella rotates depending upon the whim of the chef; two types are always available. This is a bit problematic, as we have missed the seafood paella 3 times, but it does allow proper preparation in a HUGE pan over an open fire by a dedicated paella preparer or two. Thus, whatever type they make is worthy.  We were seduced by the anytime availability of several types of paella at Julian Serrano, and learned that it's just not as good that way.

Nice place to grab drinks or a small bite before heading out for the night.   Service: This is where they really suffered. Within a span of 5 minutes, we had three different servers come over to go over the menu with us and ask our drink order. We were very confused because after the first server, we thought that was our server and gave her the drink order. So to have two more people come by showed they had no sense on anything about the tables. The crazy part was it continued throughout the night. I swear we had seven different servers!! The communication between them was terrible because they had no idea about what we ordered and our orders were all messed up! The dinner should have taken two hours tops - ended up being a three hour dinner as we sat there waiting for food we had ordered at start of the meal.  They comped our desserts and drinks because of the delay in the orders and mess ups - which was very nice of them.    Food: We ordered a ton of food! The food here is fantastic! Especially after just coming back from Barcelona, Spain. I appreciated the food so much more!  We ordered:  Sangria - good  Tomato Bread - Bomb  Ham, goat cheese, fig bread - Bomb!  Beet salad - Great!  Scallops - Delicious!   Shrimp - Awesome!  Dates - Bomb!  Seafood croquettes - Meh, not my favorite  Short Rib Paella - Great flavor - meat was on bone and not much of it. Hard to eat.   Lamb - small but great flavor  Steak - Really good!  The mousse dessert dish - So good!!   Food is fantastic! Small portions with high prices, but great flavor! Great scene! Service - poor.

My sandwich of manchego cheese and jamon iberico was okay, but I had better in Spain where I used to go at least twice a year.  My niece ordered the veggie sandwich, and all it had was a sliver of wilted lettuce (for $18!).  The service was non-attentive.

We came in a little early, around 4:30 so the place wasn't hopping quite yet for dinner. After our flight and check-in to our hotel, and then getting over to the Cosmopolitan, (which is beautiful by the way) we were ready to eat. We used Open Table for our reservation, as we weren't sure what to expect. They're on the conference floor of the Cosmopolitan, and the restaurant is big and open. I wasn't expecting such an open and airy space. They had high tables in the main space, as well as a space off to the right with I believe a mix of lower and higher tables, as well as high bar seating, and then actual bar seating along the wall of the main space. At the back of the main space was a huge open kitchen with a fire pit where they make their paellas and that was so cool to watch.   We both ordered teas, although their drinks looked amazing. The menu is so big and comprehensive with big descriptions that it takes a little while to pick out a small handful of items to order, especially if  you're trying to coordinate with another person. Our waitress, Morgan, was more than accommodating as we read our novel menus and picked out our tapas. We decided on the following:   Lomo Bellota: We started with the Smoke-cured, acorn-fed pork loin. It was thinly sliced, nicely presented and had a lot of great flavors, we enjoyed it.   Gambas al Ajillo: This was my husband's choice - shrimp in a garlic sauce. It was actually a tomato garlic sauce, and came with a cute, miniature piece of baguette, he liked it.  Paella de Pollo: The chicken and wild mushroom paella was by far our favorite dish of the evening. While filling, and a decent portion, we ate the whole thing. It was flavorful, buttery, and just incredible. The best thing we had, hands down.   Piquillos Tolosa: These were thinly sliced red peppers with sauce - they were fantastic. Soft, yet firm enough to pick up with a fork. They weren't spicy at all, and had a subtle sweet flavor. These were our second favorite of all that we ordered.  Coliflor: This was roasted cauliflower with green olives and dates. We weren't crazy about this dish, and felt it was an odd combination. The sweet with the cauliflower and the tang of the olives was a little too bizarre for us.  Atun con Ajonjol: My husband ended with the sesame crusted seared tuna and said that the tuna was over seared and tasted a little old, but over all the dish was ok.  I'm giving Jaleo four stars. We really liked the tapas experience and the restaurant was clean and pretty. Our waitress was super attentive and really nice, and took the time to explain everything to us. The paella is worth two stars on its own, we loved it so much. I'm leaving off that last star due to the Coliflor and the Atun con Ajonjol that could have been better, and we felt that everything was a little pricey. Otherwise though, this was a stellar experience that has us thinking about doing tapas again.

There were 4 of us and we indulged by ordering probably close to 20 different tapas dishes. The bill was outrageous but worth every penny.   A few highlights:  - The croquettes were served in a sneaker. Yes, a running sneaker. Not sure why, but it was cool all the same. - This place is in the Cosmopolitan which is a hip hotel in Vegas. This place may be trying to be a little too hip. It was too bright and felt like it was in the middle of a mall. You could see everyone walking by outside. Granted, it's in a Las Vegas hotel/casino so we knew there'd be some level of loud excitement surrounding us, just not so much.  -   Service was good, but odd. We never really knew who our waiter was. It kept changing.  - We did not eat one bad dish. Some were better than others, but none were bad. - Bread was hard to come by. Tapas often had incredibly delicious sauces (the  mojo  for example) and it's a shame to waste that sauce. We asked for bread to dip and got 3 little tiny pieces (for $3). It was not enough bread, at all. We ordered a few more of them. This did not spoil our appetite one bit.   A few of my favorite tapas:  - Grilled asparagus with Romesco sauce - the Romesco was incredible - Croquettas de pollo (my Cuban mother-in-law makes really good croquettes but these blew hers away!) Creamy inside, crunchy outside, so much flavor   - Papas arugas - The mojo made this dish! Without it, this is basically just salted, boiled tiny potatoes.  Thanks to a duo of mojo's (verde and rojo) this dish delicious - Warm Brussels sprouts salad - this had a really nice citrus flavor to it and was like no flavor combination I've ever had with Brussels sprouts before  - Fried dates in bacon with an apple mustard sauce - like candy. Seriously.  - Seared scallop with pine nuts - melt in your mouth good  - Mussels vinaigrette - plump and juicy mussels with aromatic broth - another reason we needed all that bread!  - Grilled hangar steak with mustard sauce and blue cheese - incredibly tender and great combination of flavors  - Shrimp sautéed with garlic - it's a traditional tapas dish but it tasted better than any other version of this I've had before  - Oysters gin & tonic - I can't eat raw oysters for a few more months but my tablemates raved about the gin & tonic sauce   Just ok:  - Pan con tomate with manchego cheese. Not bad at all, just not earth shattering  - Jamon Iberico - it was from some fancy black footed pig in Spain. It wasn't bad but it wasn't all that great either. It was the most expensive thing we ordered that night   - Homemade grilled pork sausage - I'm not a huge sausage fan in general (get your mind out of the gutter, THAT's not what I mean). This was not bad at all but just not one of my favorites    I know there was more but this is all I can remember. We had no room for dessert. The 3 folks at the table who aren't pregnant polished off several carafes of Sangria and seemed very please with it, and with themselves.  We finished with coffee and each one came in it's own little press (Spanish press, not French I guess) and a timer to tell you when to  press . The concept was great but servers came over and pressed for us before the time was up. We were all disappointed that we didn't get to press our own. Silly for us to care, I know - but why bother giving you a timer and telling you what to do if they're just going to do it for you!

A couple that stood out to me were the stuffed roasted red peppers with goat cheese, the garlic shrimp, and the chicken croquettes served in a shoe.

The menu was bright and cheery and drinks are ordered by iPad. We'd had a massive brunch earlier in the day and so weren't starving, but did split a variety of vegetarian dishes. I noticed the non-vegetarian dishes seemed to be plated quite creatively (one served in a shoe, another served as little cones).  - Pan de cristal con tomate fresco - This was probably our favorite dish. Crusty white bread with a smattering of tomato and olive oil. The tomato was more flavored into the bread, rather than a hunk of tomato sitting on top of it. Good flavor and definitely not too salted.  - Setas en escabeche - These mushrooms were fine. Nothing to write home about. A bit on the saltier end, without enough other flavor.  - Coliflor con olivas y frutos secos - A dish that is usually one of our favorites. Nothing special about it. It was on the more edible side, but again, had too much salt. The over-salting even offset the nice flavor of the fruit.  - Espinacas a la catalana - We have a favorite tapas restaurant in San Francisco that makes this beautifully (Alegrias). Whenever I see this on a menu I think it'll be served like theirs - sautéed to perfection with raisins and pine nuts. This felt like a spinach salad with salt poured on.

Ambiance and service deserve 0 stars - overly loud dining room, unnecessarily lazy staff and servers.  For the details -   Firstly, Jaleo messed up my reservation.  I originally had a res for a party of 6 people @ 6PM on Friday.  I called 3 days prior to change to 8 people @ 7 PM.  I didn't get a confirmation call the day-of which I thought was weird.  Sure enough, they never changed the original reservation and since we were  an hour late  when we arrived, they had already given up our table.  They did seat us immediately but had to squeeze us into a table meant for 6 right at the front of the restaurant by the bar and hotel escalators.  Yuck.  And, as noted by many here, the main dining room is certainly loud.  I also think it's ridiculous that they don't answer their phones before dining service begins.  Having to wait til 8PM on the east coast to call and make (and then change) reservations was ludicrous.  This is probably also why they don't call you to confirm.  So, we were seated and the waitress came around to take drink orders and informed us that, in her exact words,  the kitchen is broken  and they were doing all the cooking on the grills in the middle of the restaurant, so there were a few dishes that weren't available.  She didn't specifically mention which, of course.  We got our drinks and they were all amazing.  The famous G&T, sangria, some gold sparkly drink, a drink with instructions on how to drink it (dip this into this, then put this in your mouth, then sip this, then do a dance...)  Now, I'm a tapas whore, and the menu at Jaleo is very much standard classic tapas, nothing really out of the ordinary.  So I go to order 6 of the usual suspects for my wife and I.  They couldn't make a single one of them.  Well, what can you make then?   Well nothing from this side of the menu or that side of the menu.   So...let me try again...what CAN you make?  Wound up figuring things out and placing our order, and the tapas started arriving shortly thereafter.  Except the runners kept coming to my side of the long table, saying to me what the dish was, and then putting it down in front of me.  So I had to turn into the waiter, loudly screaming across the table to see who ordered each dish and then passing it down.  I finally got fed up around the 8th plate or so and started forcing the runners to do their job and figure out who ordered each dish so they could place it in front of the right person.  For.every.single.dish.  Ugh.  Also, there were a few dishes we had ordered doubles of that we never received.    Thank god the food was good.  We probably ordered every dish that was available and none disappointed.  Winner of the night in my book was the lamb ribs.  Fall-off-the-bone delicious.  Other mentionables - patatas bravas were potato chips which was a neat twist, and the romesco sauce had an interesting smokey flavor.

We paired that with a cheese plate that had some goat cheese (dont knock it till you try it) along with some bleu cheese and fruit, absolutely delicious!    We ventured out into the rest of the menu, we tried the calamari stuffed with pork (awesome), the grilled octopus, some small (tapas people) cones stuffed with raw salmon & roe and raw tuna along with other ingredients I cant recall, the cauliflower, brussel sprouts, and a spanish egg/potato pancake of sorts (also awesome) then the potato with mushrooms.......you get the picture we tried almost everything but the paella.  You can order what ever paella they have that day (our choices were veggy or chx/mushroom) or you can choose from 8 types but must order a whole pan (feeds 8)  Our server was attentive, very knowledgeable on the menu and friendly.

I actually didn't know Jose Andres had a restaurant at Cosmo, and when I passed by it during the day, I was so excited I made a reservation on the spot for later that night. The ambience and decor was awesome! Colorful and very spanish, definitely reminded me of Spain. One of the tables even had foosball under that you could play with. now that was... awesome.  We were seated promptly, and because it was a monday after EDC weekend, a lot of items on the menu were not available. It was saddening.. we were so hungry and all of the popular dishes were gone :( Anyways, we ordered:  -Croquetas De Pollo- I love this dish at bazaar! Had to get it here, it was just as yummy but a little bit more salty.. It comes served in a shoe. When I asked the server why, she explained it was the brand Spanish Camper- the oldest shoe brand in Spain from a small village. Jose Andre wanted to support their company, so he created this  food on the run .. haha -Jamon serrano Fermin- delicious! Came with little bread sticks and it was so so good. -Ensaladilla rusa- ultimate spanish tapa: a salad of potatoes, mayo, and imported conserved tuna with spanish trout roe- after mixing it together, it was very rich and flavorful. Yum. -La Serena con membrillo- La Serena cheese, walnut dust, and quince paste cone- wasn't a big fan of this, the cheese was overpowering, usually love Jose Andres' cones but not this one. -Ostras Gin and Tonic- oysters with lemon, gin and tonic. So refreshing and light! These oysters were small and sweet- loved it! although we both had a slight allergic reaction to these oysters. -Paella valenciana rafael vidal- couldn't leave here without trying a paella! only paella they had left.. it had chicken, rabbit, and green beans, and was absolutely yummy. We finished every last piece of rice haha.  Overall extremely yummy meal. Our server was very gracious and recommended and explained the dishes very well. She was like a Jose Andres dictionary- she really knew her information on the dishes and what was on it.   The six dishes left us feeling satisfied for two- not too full and not too hungry. Total was about $120 without tip and we ordered a drink. I saw some reviews complaining about the prices and small portions, but hey- its Vegas. Also, Jose Andres' prices and portions are always consistent- Bazaar is similar to Jaleo in terms of that. This place isnt as good as Bazaar in LA (that place has a special place in my heart) but if I am back in Vegas, I would definitely come back and eat here!", "Date": "2014-07-02", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Vincent", "ReviewID": "mh9nO1JCrIzscVOOoPST-A", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Having been to The Bazaar by Jose Andres and loved it, I was excited to try some of his more traditional fare.  Overall, I thought this meal was fun and an overall success.  We came here on a Sunday night without reservations but were seated right away as a table had just become available.  This is off to a good start!  We started with the Aceitunas ($12 for 4 anchovy stuffed green olives and 4 kalamata olive spheres made from sodium alginate).  I've had Jose's black olive spheres at the Bazaar and actually thought the kalamatas work much better.  Next, we had the Chistorra Envuelta ($8 for 6 skewers).  The spicy chorizo  was quite tasty and contrasted perfectly with the crunchiness of the potato chip wrapped around the  skewer.  The waitress highly recommended the Gambas al Ajillo ($10 for 6 shrimps) which the menu features as one of their most popular dishes.  Maybe it was high expectation from the waitress and the menu, but I thought the shrimp wasn't really anything special.  Sure it was perfectly cooked, but it just tasted like nicely cooked shrimp with garlic oil.  My favorite dish of the night was easily the Pinchon Estilo Alcantara which was squab topped with foie gras and shaved black truffle ($22).  All the flavors came together so well.. I would have ordered this plate just for myself.. who says sharing is caring?  The Rape a la Donostiarra ($10 for a large platter of thinly sliced monkfish) was pretty solid.  The waitress said it was a brave dish.. I've never had monkfish prepared this way before, but didn't think it was anything overly eccentric.  Finally, we had the Arroz a Banda con Bogavante ($28) which is their lobster paella.  I was really looking forward to this, since we were sitting right next to the paella station.  As a quick note, they only serve 2 paellas at any given night, and could take up to 30 minutes to prepare, so be aware that not all options are going to be available.  The paella was quite rich and tasty.. a tad over-seasoned, but that's ok.  Each dish is served with half a lobster tail and a claw, which was a nice touch.  We had our meal with a pitcher of red sangria, which I highly recommend.  You can never really go wrong with wine mixed with fruit.  Overall, Jaleo was pretty much what I expected from Jose Andres - tasty, modern Spanish cuisine.  I can't wait to come back to try everything else on the menu.  Definitely come in a group to maximize the selection.  I thought our party of 6 was perfect, since most of the dishes come in groups of 6.

I'm shocked that this restaurant is getting a 3.5 yelp average (which typically means a mediocre restaurant), as I just had one of the best meals of my life here and for a price that was incredibly reasonable. I eat out a VERY nice meal almost every week for work travel and compare this restaurant to that set. The dishes at Jaleo were creative with astonishing and successful combinations of flavors and ingredients.  I had:  1. Beet salad (best I've ever had by far) 2. Wild mushrooms with potato puree (delicious) 3. Shrimp sautéed in garlic (plate-licking good) 4. Spinach with pine nuts, raisins, and apples (simple but loved it) 5. For desert, flan (a masterpiece, sensational)  Also had a nice glass of wine and coffee. I was stuffed and the pre-tip bill was only $65, which I considered a bargain given the amount of food and the quality.  A sense of the creativity-- the beet salad was served with beets three ways (raw, boiled, & fried). Any of these 5 dishes, I would have raved about at another restaurant. To get 5 such dishes in one meal blew me away! I can't wait to go back.  Other comments/suggestions: The restaurant is busy and a bit clubby in feel, so it's loud though it may vary somewhat depending where you sit. The food comes out when ready, so if you want to stage your meal (e.g., appetizers then main), order in stages, not all at once. With such a large selection, it can help to ask for the waiter's favorites and the most popular dishes across the menu.

The restaurant is located on the third floor of Cosmo in their restaurant district and when I went on a Wednesday at around noon, it was literally empty.  Granted they just opened, but by the time I left at 1pm, still no one had been seated.  I grabbed a seat at the bar and took part in restaurant week.  The meal provided was the exact same as their paella lunch menu, with gazpacho, salad, and paella of the day, except it was only $20 rather than $26, per usual.  From what I saw on Yelp, I was expecting to be left unfulfilled with portion sizes and taste, but I was rather pleased.  All 3 dishes had multiple flavors and 5-6 ingredients wrapped into the food to create unique tastes.  The gazpacho was refreshing, but probably too small at a cup size.  The salad was petite as well but the ingredients kept you excited with the saltiness of the fish and freshness of the greens.  The paella is the best in town from what I've tasted.  There's not many Spanish Tapas dishes available in Las Vegas, but this paella matches even what I've tasted abroad.  I would recommend trying it no doubt.  For $20, the meal was very reasonable and I would come again.  I do wish the paella would have been more seafood oriented rather than the chicken and mushroom provided, but it was still delicious.  The service was spot on and the atmosphere was nice, albeit a little lonely with no one in the restaurant.

Again, there were 10 of us, and these were small tapas plates, so only half of us would get literally one bite of food and that was it.  Then we decided to get a paella.

I'm not a fan of rabbit and others in our group were incredibly opposed to ordering rabbit, so that left us with one paella option, the vegetarian one. For a place as expensive as Jaleo, to have that bad of a selection is completely unacceptable.

With this being said...let me say that Jaleo did not disappoint! The food was delicious and truly met all my expectations. While at é I was offered an amazing wine, which I was disappointed was no longer on the menu. BUT... Nelson our server presented me with an equally amazing glass of white wine and my disappointed was quickly turned to complete satisfaction. We also ordered sangria which was filled of so many refreshing and crisp flavors. The sangria is a complete MUST have! Now on to the food.   Not really a fan of bruschetta but the Pan de cristal con tomate has me rethinking my dislike of soggy tomato sauce on a over toasted bread. This was such a fresh, crisp and clean tasting tomato sauce over a perfectly toasted sliced of bread which I enjoyed with manchego cheese and this pairing was perfect. We did a few cheese pairing (equally delicious), the vegetable paella (which I was not to excited about but surprised was DELICIOUS), and pollo al ajillo which went perfect with the vegetable paella. The Mini pepito de ibérico are nothing less than addicting! We started with 2 and then 3 and then we had to stop because we could have ordered 12 more. Perfect little sliders with so much flavored packed into each bite.   Yes, many may complain about the menus prices. But I would argue that point by saying you get what you pay for. The food is great and not one complaint here about the prices. The service was excellent. Nelson our server took amazing care of us and his recommendations were spot on.

The paella with lobster was a notch above uncle bens seasoned rice, lobster was tough and the whole thing about room temp when it arrived at the table. Would avoid that one if you visit as it's one of the worst versions of paella I have ever had. Eggplant was marginal and soup my husband tried he liked. The olive oil ice cream  was nice but hard to form an opinion when it amounted to about 3 tablespoons worth. They could up the portion a bit to match their prices.  Some one else here commented on the noise - absolutely mind numbing loud. I had to get up and leave my husband to finish the bill as I couldn't take it anymore and was getting a headache.

There was no need to worry!! This place was fantastic!!  We were seated immediately for our reservation and greeted by our friendly waiter, who made some great suggestions for the tapas style dishes.  We started with jamon iberico.....OMG...melt in your mouth, salty, nutty goodness of the iberico pig.  We were both in awe....we started to feel much better about our meal here after that.  We then had the liquid olives....how do they do that?  I think the liquid olives tasted more like olives than the actual stuffed olives that came with it.  Both were soooo good!  After that, we had the spicy chorizo wrapped in crispy potato...perfect combo.  Loved the flavor of the spicy chorizo...left a bit of heat but not too much.  My larger dish pick was the Rossejat....paella made with angel hair like pasta and shrimp.  There was ham in there as well.  Delicious!!  I especially loved the crispy edges that burned a little against the cast iron skillet.  It was served with some garlic butter sauce, which I dipped the shrimps in....just heavenly.  My BF's pick of the night was Secreto Iberico....the skirt steak of the iberico pig, which came with pan con tomate.  This was THE BEST pork dish we both have ever had.  It was so juicy, tender, flavorful....ok, I'm drooling just thinking about that wonderful piece of meat....mmmmm.  Pan con tomate was good too, but nothing compared to this piece of meat.  I think we'll be dreaming about it until the next time we can hit Vegas again.  Dessert - flan and some apple tart thing...can't remember the exact name, but also very delicious.  Apple and cinnamon wrapped in brioche with vanilla bean ice cream...so good.  Flan had a bit of a citrus taste to it but the consistancy was perfect.    If you're anywhere near Vegas, go here and try the secreto iberico.  You will not be disappointed.

Nothing overwhelmingly great, but the lobster salad was good, as were the gambas con gabardina, and the endive with goat cheese. The pan con tomate with anchovies and the the bacon-wrapped dates were both ok, although nothing spectacular. And we should have stayed away from the patatas bravas, which for some strange reason consisted of a bowl lays potato chips squirted with sirracha and mayonnaise.  The real killer for the evening was the service. I realize dumb people have to work someplace, but do they all have to be assigned to my table? The bus boy kept awkwardly climbing over us or shoving himself between us trying to take our dishes and glasses when we clearly still had food and pitchers of sangria in front of us. At one point he practically tried to take the fork out of my date's mouth mid-bite. An I once had to slap at his hand to keep him from taking my plate. He's very lucky he didn't catch a fork to the hand. The waiter was really no better, and screwed up our order at least 5 times. It's 3 days later and I'm still waiting for my gazpacho.

To start we ordered the pan de cristal con tomate fresco which is nothing more than crispy bread with fresh tomato.

Cooked on their real wood fire pit the way paellas should be cooked. Texture and flavor was very good, I just wished it had more meat variety like shrimp, calamari and chorizo the way I'm used to paellas and yes the price would be higher but it would be be better than making a paella with half the ingredients just so they can call it a deal.

The sparkling white sangria, though a bit light for a cocktail of its own, paired well with the salty and spicy foods throughout the meal.

I can't find it....too confusing.....   Really?  Good grief.  Jaleo was very good.  In fact, borderline excellent minus one total miss on a dish.  If you don't know, or are challenged like a few reviewers who  couldn't find it , it is in the Cosmopolitan, if I remember right, on the 3rd floor.  We took the very brilliant route of  reading the sign  that said what floor it was on and took the escalator up.    The space is beautiful, as most new restaurants in the newer hotels are.  Our server was sleepwalking a bit, but the food made up for it.    The salmon crudo and roe in a  cone  was a real showstopper.  Just delicious, and what we started off with (though we ordered 2 more).  We proceeded with some dry-cured Chorizo which was also really delicious.  The  bikini de jamon  were very tasty (little pressed sandwiches) as well as the chicken fritters which literally melted in your mouth.  The meal was really on fire until we hit the paella, which is supposed to be their specialty.  You basically take whichever one they are serving at the time, and ours was chicken and rabbit.  The bottom line is that the meat was severely overcooked.  If it had not been for the amazing dishes before, that would have been a catastrophe, but taken overall, the meal was still great.    We had a monster caraffe of Sangria which was solid, but that is not what you should order.  You order your drinks from an iPad they give you, and the first one you see is  the world's best  gin and tonic.  The server played it up, so we thought what the hell.  We ended up trying all 3 and they were absolutely outstanding.  Really delicious stuff and a must try!  Overall, very solid.  Ignore the nonsensical reviews talking about  small portions  and outrageous prices.  I've said this in other reviews, if you walk into a Vegas restaurant in a newer Hotel looking for a bargain, you are just a little out of your comfort zone (how was that for PC??).

Was it the gambling?  The constant ability to find something to do at any time of day?  The lights and people of the strip?  While all of these things make Vegas what it is today- the best part of my recent trip was dinner at Jaleo.  On a friend's recommendation, I made a reservation before I got to Vegas just to ensure we could get in.  Getting in didn't seem to be the problem on this Tuesday night as we went early- but by the time we left- every table was filled.  Also know that Jaleo is located in the Cosmopolitan hotel at the top of the bank of elevators.  If you come in on the cab side- you will have to walk all the way through the casino and then head upstairs.  We were seated in some funky clear acrylic chairs that had us wondering all night if our  butts looked big in this?   Kidding . . .but those are some funny chairs!  Our server was great making plenty of suggestions and finding me a Spanish wine that would equal my beloved Cab.  They do the ipad thing with their drink selections listed on it- but for this girl- sometimes just asking is the best way.  And then- Ta-da  . . . . THE FOOD!  Our server suggested 6 or so things to share but there were so many things to try that we ended up ordering 8.  Not to worry, there wasn't a smidge of anything left on our table.  In no particular order we had: -Gin and Tonic oysters -Chicken Fritters served in a shoe.  A SHOE!! -White asparagus with thyme served in a sardine can -Lobster salad- very unexpected and fresh -Cauliflower with dates and olives- a god must have created this mixture it was so good -Scallops in a red sauce -Steamed Mussels  -Grilled chicken  All were amazing, although I probably would not order the chicken again as it just couldn't stand up to the amazing combination of flavors of the other dishes.  And that shoe that the chicken fritters come in was a funny story.  I saw the busser walking around with a shoe on his tray and asked just what was up with that.  He said the chef liked that brand of shoe and that he chose to serve food in it.  As simple as that , and even though neither my friend or l were eating fried or breaded food, we had an order of those darn fritters!

Now given that Jaleo is at the Cosmopolitan on the strip, I was already anticipating high prices. What I didn't anticipate was: finding it difficult to find the restaurant since it wasn't marked well at all, very tiny portions for what they charged, and no sensitivity to food allergens.   First off, it took my group a bit to find the place, with the restaurant not marked properly. Our confusion was resolved when we stumbled on it and they told us we had arrived. We only saw markings for China Poblano, so the confusion never really went away.   After we sat down and started reviewing the menu, we started asking the waitress questions about the menu. Thankfully we brought up my allergy to shell fish because the whole fried section of the menu was hands off, even if items didn't have shell fish in it. Turns out they fry everything in the same oil - chicken, dates, shrimp... not a best practice they should continue.   The dishes I was able to eat were good, but honestly, the dishes did not go far at all. Due to the fact I was expecting a nicer atmosphere and not having half the menu eliminated from eating because of the frying issue, the lack of food on the small plates really through this place over the edge for me. I would definitely recommend other restaurants in the Cosmopolitan over this one: Holstein's - excellent burgers, Comme Ca - excellent french bistro and STK - good steakhouse.", "Date": "2013-04-30", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Castine", "ReviewID": "R462MUz8JnDaS30SrZx1ng", "Overall": "2", "Content": "I've tried to go to Jaleo for dinner twice before, but neither happened.  I wish I hadn't pushed for a third try, because this meal sucked.  I would've given it one star, but one thing we had was really good, so it gets an extra star.    My favorite foodie friend and I were both in Vegas on a Friday night, so decided to go to Jaleo.  He has been to the one in DC before and liked it, and I like Jose Andres food, so we were both excited.    We were sat promptly, and the waitress came over a few minutes later.  She gave a whole canned speech about the menu (which is something I hate)...and gave us the iPad wine list.  There are some relatively good priced wines and of course lots of spanish options, so it started out good.    She finally came and took our order, and we got a few things from each part of the menu, including the Paella Valenciana.  She told us they would group our items from the kitchen light to heavy and stage them to come out 1-2 at a time.  Great.  However, that wasn't the case.  We got three things within like 2 seconds of each other.  The first things were 1. Pan con tomate (Toasted slices of rustic bread brushed with fresh tomato). this was adequate.  not quite the traditional way, but tasty enough; 2. Some tiny green olives stuffed with anchovies and  liquid black olives . this dish was $14 for like 5 small green olives.  total rip off and i know anchovies are salty, as are olives, but this dish was too salty to eat...and yes, i've had them both together before and it doesn't need to be that overly salty; 3. tortilla de patata (Spanish omelet with potatoes and onions).  i'm about to get married, and this is one of the dishes on my menu, which means i've tried about 20 tortillas from caterers over the last few months, and this version was the worst i've ever had.  previously, i was shocked by how bad some of the caterers versions were of this dish, but this dish was twice as bad as the worst.  first of all, she asked us if we wanted it well done when we ordered it.  this is not a question that should be asked.  it's supposed to be a simple dish:  onions and potatoes sauteed til tender, add egg, let form til set completely.  that is it.  we got it and it was wet, and runny, so not even well done like she asked if we wanted it.  it was also super thin, with only like one layer of potato.  it was so gross we didn't finish it.    So then we flagged her down and said we wanted to slow it down a bit, since everything so far had been rushed to our table. This was a mistake, because from then on it was supperr long wait for everything.  She told us then that our paella was ready, and we said oh no thanks - we want to wait until the end for that dish, since it's most like a  main course .  This is after she told us the kitchen would structure it light to heavy for us, so delivering paella with the first few things made no sense.  The next dish was Ensalada rusa (a salad of potatoes, imported conserved tuna and mayonnaise).  This was  okay , but not great.  It was much better than it looked - It was covered with foam.  It looked like my cat threw up on it.  I'm not a foam fan.  But the potatoes were cooked well, and the tuna was tasty.  The next dish was the Seared scallops with romesco sauce.  The dish arrived and was pretty enough to look at.. However,  both our scallops had grit.  This, is not good.  Neither of us finished our scallop (the dish had two) and we called the waitress over to tell her they were gritty.  She apologized, but didn't seem to really know what that meant.   Then we got the last dish before our paella...the veal cheeks with whipped olive oil potatoes.  This is the only reason the restaurant got 2 stars.   This dish was really good.  Looked good.  Tasted great.  Very tender veal cheeks.  The potatoes were fluffy bites of heaven.  Very very good.  This is what I expected every dish to be like, but sadly, it was the only good dish.  So now we are excited to try the paella.  i guess i was still holding out hope it would save the meal?  but the waitress comes over and tells us that they're out of the paella.  What?  We ordered it an hour ago.  They had it.  You tried to serve it to us at the start of the meal, we said we'd wait...and now you're out of it??  She offered us a different paella, at double the cost of the one we ordered.  We said, no thanks.  And were super unhappy about it.  We were both still hungry, but didn't want to try anymore crappy food, so asked for the bill.  We got the bill, and the damn scallops were still on it.  We called the manager over to complain (we've both been in the biz for years, and if someone complains about a legitimate quality issue, that should NEVER be on the check).  So we explained that they were gritty and shouldn't be on the check.  He apologized and claimed it was an oversight and took it off the bill.    Overall, a disappointing meal and I'll never go back.

Also, because the portions were small,  each of us could pick something that wasn't necessarily a favorite of the other.  My favorite items of the night, the brussels sprouts salad which had serrano ham, apricots, apples and a sherry dressing.  Second favorite - Deep fried, bacon wrapped dates!   So decadent and so tasty.

The slick idiosyncrasy of The Cosmopolitan continues through Jaleo. I loved all the design details from the typographic front gates to the piecework bull mounted on the wall and chicken tots served in a shoe (surprisingly cute and not gross idea). If you're lucky enough to have arrived with good company as I did, the restaurant's open layout and interesting tidbits allows for a good night of rousing conversation. My own party aside, I found the dining staff to be quite full of themselves, or rather, brainwashed by the supposed amazingness and sadly mislead by what a standard portion size is. I give them part of the blame for setting false customer expectations.  FOOD // The food really fell short of 3-stars. I've been to different small-plate kind of eateries before and Jaleo neither measured up for it's priciness in ingenuity nor taste. We took a while to figure out what to order because we were informed by our group of comrades who had a reservation before we did that the portions were fantastically small and the food not all that great. One friend honestly, and repeatedly, told us to get up and flee the place before it was too late. Could it really be that bad? sangria :: This was a good choice. Served with fresh slice of citrus, chunk o' watermelon, and some mint. And one will need some amount of vino to make up for everything else.  lobster paella :: We expressed concerns about hunger satisfaction so the waiter suggested the paella as a good way to fill up. The lobster paella had good flavors, but was rather salty (like most of the food).  fried bacon wrapped dates :: Bacon wrapped anything is always good and ever better when it's deep fried.  chicken fritters :: They're like tater-tot sized pot pies.  garlic soup :: This was the worst. It tasted like you took the packet of Chicken Top Ramen seasoning and poured it into a cup of lukewarm water and then dropped an egg in there. The waitress gushed about how the egg is cooked at exactly 63 degrees and gave me a stony stare when she caught me rolling my eyes. I apologize that your soup sucked.  chilled almond & garlic soup :: Interesting combination of flavors. Much better than the other soup, but that isn't saying much.  kurobuta pork jowls & scallops :: I ordered this and it was microscopic for $14. A few slivers of unmemorable pork and maybe half a scallop total. I can get this for $6 at a Japanese izakaya.  desserts :: We ordered 3 with components like olive oil ice cream, flan, and chocolate mousse. Again, nothing I think is worth mentioning. Do we sense a pattern?  All in all, the food didn't impress me in any way, especially factoring in the price and portion size. We had a party of 7 and with 2 carafes of sangria, 3 paellas, plus about 10 small plates, it ended up being $51/person. Jaleo is like dating a rich bitch: she may look nice and spout esteem, but it's all shallow and will set you back more money than it's worth.

We were in the mood for tapas anyway, so all it took was a quick visit to Open Table and we had a 9:30 reservation.  The place was bustling.  We showed up a few minutes late - you know how it is, walking the strip in heels - and still had to wait a few minutes for our table to be cleared and set, but we chatted amicably with the hostess (about the wonderfulness of the Mission in San Francisco, randomly) and were shortly led inside.  The decor was playful.  Our table was just beneath an enormous stuffed bull (I'm guessing it was not an actual, taxidermied one, but what do I know) wearing a silver lame wrestling mask, and I liked the  patchwork-style mixed prints on the extremely comfortable banquettes and the red pendant lamps that hung throughout the restaurant.  I especially adored the menus printed with various words relating to tapas - seriously, is ñum ñum the Spanish equivalent of nom nom?  Because that is way, way better.  To drink, we ordered a full carafe of sangria, which I found to be delicious in a spicy, more nuanced way than most sangrias (and which also seemed to be on the strong side - score).  To start with, we ordered the selection of five cheeses - Pasamontes Manchego, Murcia al Vino, Garrotxa, La Serena, and La Peral - and the Pan con Tomate with Jamon Serrano.    All the cheeses were delicious, although we counted the Garrotxa and La Peral as our absolute favorites, and although it did turn out that the cheese plate came with Pan con Tomate anyway (as well as dried apricots, raisins on the vine, and Marcona almonds), we were pleased to have the extra when the next round of food came.  Next we had the warm Brussels sprouts salad, which was so amazing I considered demanding the recipe from the kitchen, with chunks of jamon Serrano, halved grapes, and dried apricots in a tangy dressing.  The gambas al ajillo were - I am so very sorry to say - not what I was expecting...I own Jose Andres' tapas cookbook and regularly make his gambas al ajillo from it to great fanfare, and these were not in the same style.  In fact you could barely tell that they had every been in the pan with that wonderful garlic and olive oil mixture, which we sopped up with the spare Pan con Tomate.  Finally, in an effort to order at least one thing that wasn't totally standard tapas fare, we had the Tortilla de Erizos, tortilla with sea urchin - the uni was creamy and provided a nice contrast with the tortilla, although, full disclosure, I wasn't totally won over and probably wouldn't order it again.  For dessert, we had the Pan con Chocolate, which was basically like, a quenelle of chocolate flan rolled in cookie crumbs and topped with ice cream, a superthin shard of caramelized bread, and a drizzle of olive oil.  It was AMAZING - sweet and salty and unctuous.  Seriously, I'm now contemplating putting olive oil on all my desserts.  Delicious and heart healthy!...or, you know, not.  After a couple of cafe con leches we got the check and it was a very respectable $120 or so.

If you're vegan, and don't feel like trekking to the Wynn, Jaleo has a ton of tasty vegan(izable) options for you.  I used to live in DC and go to the original Jaleo in my pregan days, so I was very excited to see Jose Andres open a restaurant here!  I went there solo and ate at the tapas bar, which is fun, because you get to watch them make all kinds of little dishes and you can ask the sous chefs about what they're making etc.  Plus the people next to me were very friendly and we had a nice chat.  The atmosphere seems very laid back and conducive to such interactions.  (Note: it's not like a sushi bar; they don't serve you directly.  A server will come up behind you and take your order.)  You would be well-advised to make a reservation if you want to eat there on a weekend night - it was completely packed with a line when I went.  I got the only seat left in the place!  Note: the food here is VERY salty because they use a lot of finishing salts.  If you aren't into that, just request your food with  no added salt.   I had the pan con tomate (tomato bread), espinacas (wilted spinach with apples and shallots), papas arrugas (salted roast potatoes with red and green chile sauces - not spicy though), and the chef brought out a sample of the veggie paella!  I also had apple sorbet for dessert.  (For Bay Area people - they use the same Pacojet technology as Scream Sorbet to make an amazingly creamy vegan sorbet).  Everything was very tasty, if a bit oily and salty.  Very rich!  (I will order w/ no added salt next time.)  The folks next to me shared their sangria, which was very tasty (although not made the traditional way... they add the fruit to your glass rather than macerating in the wine.)  The service was very attentive at times, but hit or miss.  I had a great time and enjoyed my meal and will definitely be back with a group so I can try lots more things!  For you non-vegan foodies, you might wanna check out e, the chef's tasting room at Jaleo.  They do a 20-course dinner (two seatings a night) for ~$150.  They can make exceptions for some dietary restrictions/allergies, but sadly don't do a vegan version (yet?).   Here is a list of the vegetarian/vegan/veganizable dishes:  Pan con tomate -tomato bread Gazpacho - cold tomato soup Manzanas con hinojo y manchego (minus cheese) - apple-fennel salad Espinacas a la Catalana - wilted spinach with sherry dressing and apples Escalivada - cold roasted eggplant and pepper Setas a ajillo - garlic mushrooms Trigueros con romesco - asparagus w/ Romesco sauce Ensalada de coles de bruselas con albaricoques, manzanas y jamon (minus the jamon - ham) - brussels sprout salad Remolacha con citricos (minus the cheese) - citrus/beet salad Papas Arrugas with mojo verde y rojo - roasted potatoes Verdura Paella - Veggie paella (they do not use chicken stock, only water)", "Date": "2011-01-20", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Gustavo", "ReviewID": "0UFPUZ2YXP8hI1WLU9CyOg", "Overall": "3", "Content": "This place is not worth the price.

My friend ordered the lamb tapas. We thought they forgot about them because we had finished all of our 10 tapas we ordered and they still did not show up.

However, depending on the dish, some of the tapas at both locations are EXCELLENT.  Like The Bazaar, you have to know what to order; if you order the right things, the food can be AMAZING.  I ate here as a snack meal, so only tried 4 tapas, ranked from best to worst (photos uploaded of all 4) :  Rossejat (4.5 stars): This dish was DELICIOUS. The menu says  norwegian lobster,  but it's more like a giant prawn on top.  The  prawn  is cooked to perfection; very juicy and tender.  It rests on top of a bed of crispy noodles (with bits of cuttlefish mixed in).  Served with a garlic aioli sauce, which goes really well with the noodles.  This is a must-order dish.  It is a bit on the salty side though, so minus 1/2 star. Otherwise, this dish is perfect!   Sauteed shrimp (4 stars): Simple, yet good.  Served in a lemon-garlic sauce that goes really well with the juicy shrimp.  Chicken tenders/Croquettas (3 stars): A bit on the salty side.  The waiter recommended this dish as a house favorite, but it was only ok.  The filling in the fried dough was a bit too creamy for my liking.  I also didn't like the idea of it being served in a shoe.  Uni w/ pomegranate foam (1.5 stars): Very pretty dish, but taste-wise, not so great.  I love uni, but this dish ruined it.  Uni doesn't pair well with pomegranate.  Uni naturally has a slight sweet, creamy taste, but when soaked in pomegranate foam juice, it gives it a sour taste & sour uni is just not good.  Once the sour flavor goes away, the uni tastes better, but might as well just eat uni by itself then.", "Date": "2011-03-04", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Lana", "ReviewID": "CiFCHzLKI3eiUPbf_AkAiA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I was craving some rabbit meat.

At the table in front of us was what looked to be a call girl and her customer for the evening. We spent some time trying to decide if she was of the  high end  variety and decided that she was not. She definitely looked bored.  To our right was a man in his 40s and a guy in his 20s and a guy who looked to be in his teens.  We spent the majority of our evening trying to determine the relationship here - was it a love triangle? Was he their gigolo? Who knows.. but that's what makes Vegas fun.  Other than that you had the typical bachelor party, a table with 20 dudes, and a table of 4 women in their 40s clearly trying to relive their youth.    We chose Jaleo because we were planning to go to Marquee after dinner and they are both located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  We called from the pool earlier in the afternoon and were told that a table for 4 wouldn't be available until 9:45 pm. It seemed late, but we decided to show up at 9 pm and have a drink at the bar and hope the table opened up sooner, which it did (small tip).  From what I can remember, this is what we ordered:  Croquetas de pollo - Traditional chicken fritters Mejillones en escabeche - Mussels marinated in Sherry vinegar Chorizo Palacios - A slightly spicy cured pork sausage seasoned with pimentón and garlic Patatas bravas - A Jaleo favorite with spicy tomato sauce and alioli Canelones tradicionales de cerdo y hígado de pato con salsa bechamel - Pork and foie gras canelones with bechamel sauce Mejillones al Vapor - Steamed mussels with bay leaf, lemon and olive oil Fricandó de carilleras de ternera y puré de patatas al aceite de oliva - Veal cheeks and morels with olive oil potato purée Carne asada con piquillos Julián - de Lodosa - Grilled skirt steak with piquillo pepper confit  Everything was pretty good, but nothing stands out as outstanding enough that I would say that you must order it.  The Patatas Bravas were - to warn you - just seasoned potato chips.  I chose the Canelones tradicionales de cerdo y hígado de pato con salsa bechamel because of the  foie gras  component (you may or may not know that it is illegal in California and I needed my fix) but you couldn't even tell there was foie gras in there, which was disappointing for me.  Food was good, not great, and pricing is what you would expect for a restaurant in the Cosmopolitan (overpriced but at the same time, reasonably priced for where you are).

Don't get me wrong, I understand quality over quantity, but if you really break it down, give me an endless supply of the minuscule tapas, so small I can barely remember what I ate, I still wouldn't come here. The plates are small (yes for the 4th time in this review, not sure if I got my point across), but the quality of the tapas are not even that great or anything spectacular. The entire dinner, I couldn't stop thinking about the cup-o-noodle I purposely didn't eat because I didn't want to spoil my appetite, bad move.   This place is not good for groups, seeing as you have to order at least 3-4 orders of each tapa to feed a table of 9-10.

My wife had the gin and tonic drink I am not usually a wine drinker but wanted to try the experience.  They started us off with the famous Iberian ham and cheese which was amazing and I can't remember all the dishes they were so much but the highlights for me were as follows:  The Iberian ham they have us generous portions of that but I loved the cheese also and wish we had more than two pieces.  The blood sausage was unique I had never tried it before.  Interesting flavors and the sauce accompanying the blood sausage was excellent.  The wines accompanied with these meals so far were ok for me I tried to meld the wine with the meals but for me they did not work well.  The watermelon salad was very good but I hate goat cheese with a passion lol my wife liked it a lot.  The gazpacho I did not enjoy i could not taste much of anything.  The paia was a bit of a disappointment the rise tasted way too oily and we were hoping for seafood but got rabbit and chorizo sausage on the side.  The rabbit was cooked perfectly and I had never had rabbit in my life.  The chorizo sausage was amazing and dish also came with spinach salad that tasted good also.  The wine pairing with this meal also was ok for me also.  By this time we were both very full and it was time for dessert.  The dessert was amazing amazing amazing amazing.  It was a chocolate cake and ice cream with a piece of fried bread I'm not sure what it was made of and olive oil was sprinkled on top of it which I think was an Amazing touch.  The best part of everything with this dish was the wine omg I was in heaven it was rich and filled with so many flavors.  The wait staff was wonderful our server was great and at the end of our meal they brought out a little bowl of ice cream with a candle to celebrate our anniversary.

I've always loved spanish food since a family vacation when I was 14, so when I saw there was a tapas place in the hotel we were staying at, I knew we had to go.  We didn't have a reservation (story of my life) so we ended up at the little bar in front of one of the prep areas.  This ended up being really cool since I actually saw one of my dishes being prepared- more on that later.            Our server was great- she had a lot of solid recommendations, including the gin and tonic.  It's my boyfriend's favorite drink, so we had high hopes which were completely met and exceeded.  Delicious!  The sphere of ice was awesome too.     We started with the salmon tartare and salmon roe cones, which were reminiscent of those we had at The French Laundry- not as good, and slightly fishy for my taste, but my boyfriend enjoyed them.  Next the spanish omelette and gazpacho.  The spanish omelette was good, but only average.  The gazpacho was AMAZING though.  While we were waiting I noticed the cook in the prep station in front of me delicately placing tomatoes and sprigs of something green- using tweezers(!)- into a dish.  I commented on how cool that attention to detail was, and two minutes later that dish appeared in front of me, ready for cold soup to be poured over it!  The soup was fantastic, the perfect melding of all the flavors, not too spicy and salsa-y, not to greasy and oily.   I would have been totally happy eating several bowls of this the entire meal.  We also got the shrimp sautéed in garlic, grilled asparagus and raw salmon.  The shrimp and asparagus were as expected, good, but not incredible.  The salmon was my boyfriend's favorite part of the meal.  It was sliced paper thin and spread across the plate.  I have no idea how they sliced it so thin but it was wonderful.

They had one in Bethesda, then opened another in DC. It was one of my go-to places. Good food, delicious sangria - just a great time. I was sad to leave it behind when I left the DC area.   So imagine my surprise when I notice the hotel I'm staying at in Las Vegas has a Jaleo. Jackpot! But not so much...  We were able to walk in around 8ish on a Tuesday night and get a table for four. We were seated promptly and our waiter was over fairly quickly to take our drink orders. I know some people might find the cocktail menu on an iPad to be cool - but to me, it's just annoying. Why can't I see a list of drinks before the waiter gets there? Instead, we all have to huddle around the screen he's holding up and click around. I get that we're in the  digital age  - but occasionally, you might want to take practicality into consideration.   We opted for a carafe of sangria to start. This was my first disappointment. It didn't resemble the sangria I used to love. It was sweet, but it also had some type of green leafy thing in it (mint maybe?) - and it just took away from the sangria I used to love.   Next came the task of ordering food. Many at the table wanted paella, but there were only two types available on the menu that they said we could order for a table of four. So even though we saw many delicious choices, we were told only two were available - not the service I'm used to. In addition, there were a handful of tapas that they were out of already.   The waiter kept pushing and trying to steer us the tasting menus (a whooping $55+ per person). When I said we would just make some individual choices, he pushed again saying we should get items to share (the plates are tiny enough - can we just pick what we want first). He also kept saying it was wrong to make individual choices because they come out at all different times, so one person could have food and another couldn't (something I'm well aware of, as was my party). He kept talking at us to the point we felt overwhelmed. Our party was getting frustrated and contemplated walking out (after paying for the sangria). I convinced everyone to just ignore him and order what we wanted.   Finally, we got our orders in and the food started coming out. Just about everything I ordered was salty or bland. The bacon-wrapped dates were the best (for me), but deep fried and greasy, so they were a bit rough on the stomach. The others liked their choices (mostly), and no one cared that the food rolled out in waves.  The waiter did check on us a lot, so we were never without drinks or water. And the wait staff was quick to take away empty plates and replace silverware and sharing plates, so that was good. Still, we skipped dessert because we just wanted to get out of there.

They change their menu occasionally so the brussel sprouts that everyone raves about is no longer available! The waitress also recommended 3-4 tapas for each + the large Paella dish BUT 2 each + paella was sufficient!

Order a Carafe for ~3 glasses.   *Pan de cristal con tomate fresca (Half a loaf of toasted, uniquely crispy and ethereal bread brushed with fresh tomato): aka Tomato Bread. Delicious! Supposedly the bread is imported.It's a great starter!   *Arroz con costillas de cerdo ibérico de bellota (Made with the ribs of the famous, black-footed ibérico de bellota pigs of Spain): So, the Chef chooses 2 of the 5 paellas to make each day. On this day, there was this one + the Rabbit one (Paella valenciana 'Rafael Vidal' A true classic of chicken, rabbit and green beans). It says allow for  45 minute wait  because you'll be served when it's ready. They continuously make batches. Once each batch is done, they ring a cast iron bell and yell out  Paella ! I've never been to Spain so I don't really have anything to compare it to. However, I like that the rice was  crispy . A little on the oilier side but it is pork. Meat was tough though.   * Gambas al ajillo (The very, very famous tapa of shrimp sautéed with garlic): JUST DO IT. Sauteed with garlic but there's a rich & warm tomato-like  sauce  on it which MADE this dish. So good.   *Chorizo ibérico de bellota Fermín (A dry-cured chorizo made with ibérico meat): eh, skip. tasted like a dry hot dog and it was on a bed of some kind of corn/polenta looking thing but didn't help   *Caña de cabra con higos (Murcia) A soft, semi-sweet goat's milk cheese paired with raisin walnut bread and fig jam: I don't like stinky cheese but something about this paired with raisin walnut bread & fig jam made this a winner!   *San simón con garapiñado de frutos secos (Galicia) A smoked cow's milk cheese paired with house-made nut brittle: Loved this one because of how mild it was. It's a harder cheese but not like parmesan-hard. The nut brittle was tasty s well.   *Manzana con hinojo y queso manchego (Sliced apple and fennel salad with Manchego cheese, walnuts and Sherry dressing): This was a nice palate cleanser. Super refreshing with the crispy granny smith apples + fennel.  *Coliflor con olivas y frutos secos (Sautéed cauliflower with dates and olives): Waitress said this is a hit or miss dish but we LOVED this.

The food is usually consistently good and the last time I was there it left a bad taste in my mouth and figured maybe someone who cared at the restaurant would maybe read:   To starts...the server was pretentious and rolled his eyes at me asking for something different. (I know difficult people who order, and I'm not one of them. I think I asked for no onion.. Something that wasn't a big deal...). I always order their expensive ham. The stuff from Spain that is ridiculously priced but so delicious.. I always say what the hell.   Well, most normal servers bring extra bread when you ask for extra bread... This server literally ended up charging me like 15.00 for every few pieces of bread they brought... After over $45.00 extra dollars w tax..I HAD to say something on principle.   Well, apparently this is 'bread from Spain..' (I don't even know wtf that even means... Unless they're literally overnighting loaves of bread in from Spain... Doubtful). And Also the server let me know that I didn't clarify when I said,  can you bring extra bread for the table,  I wasn't specific enough, etc'.   I say.. Ok fine... Side note: after the waiter and manager continued to make me feel like no one else in the world could EVER make this mistake...not even flinching or offering to take any of the $45.00 Spanish bread off the bill- I debate in my mind if I should just let it go... Or again on principle.. Explain to them why they NEED to understand where I'm coming from or at least pretend to.. Because when someone orders extra bread for the table... The server SHOULDN'T presume that what is meant.. Is that they want the special Spanish bread that is $15.00 an order!!! Am I right or am I VERY right??? (At the risk of already being dubbed, that table w the annoying white girl who won't stfu about her bread... I just decided to go all the way and let them hate me... I was too far in to stop..)  So, I tell them that the last several times I've been here... My servers just act normal about it... See I'm spending like $80.00 on a few pieces of ham alone... And bring a few extra slices of bread.. Of their 'Spanish' bread... I told them this and said... I don't care what bread you bring... Just not the kind that costs $15.00 for 4 slices that you ring in 3X on my bill. The manager basically reiterated that I was incorrect for feeling any 'kind of way' about this, reminded me the bread is from SPAIN!! and made me feel like an even bigger jackass for continuing to say something.   Let's say I was 100% wrong about this.. (Doubtful, but still..) .. They should make me feel like I am totally right cuz I'm the customer. Now... I've worked in so many restaurants and NEVER ever gave any clients or customers attitudes because that's just not the way this world works. The customer is and should always FEEL like they are right.     After this, the passive aggressive manager showed me that he removed my Spanish bread from the bill...Then preceded to send over 3 baskets of their house bread when the meal was over, to make me feel like an even bigger jerk. The bread baskets were literally on top of one another with the black book check also on the table.   I am not a fan of people giving restaurants 1 or 2 stars based on poor service if the food is consistent. And that's why this mark isn't lower. It should be a 1 star but the food is usually great. My problem with this experience is I wouldn't even classify this event as someone having a bad day. They repeatedly had many chances to make this bread fiasco just go away... And they enjoyed flexing their 'power' and making me feel bad/ awful about the entire situation. I used to go here once every 3 months...

They bring pan con tomate to the table to start which was delicious.  We ordered plates of olives as well as their prosciutto plate which came with four different types of meat.  The chorizo was to die for.  The olive plate came with olives stuffed with anchovies as well as this bizarre kind of emulsion, it was kind of a liquid olive in a transparent skin.  It was definitely different.  We ordered various small plates to share.  Everyone loved the octopus and potatoes.  The squid is served over black ink and was probably the largest small plate that we got and it was really good.  We got goat cheese stuffed red peppers, which were delicious but I think the goat cheese was mixed with some sort of blue cheese.  I ordered the cod salad, which is raw cod marinated in some sort of vinaigrette and served with olives and oranges, it was so good! My friend got the steak and loved it.  We ordered a serving of paella to share.  They make two paellas every night and alternate between which one is ready to be served.  The two paellas they were serving that night were a pork paella and a vegetable paella.  The vegetable paella was ready to be served when we got there so if we ordered that one we would not have waited, but we ordered the pork instead and it came out at the end of our meal which was totally fine.  We drank sangria the whole time which was $50 for a carafe but we each got at least one glass out of it.  Our server was excellent, she was very prompt and seemed busy but we got everything we ordered in a timely fashion.  She was also incredibly knowledgable and could answer every question we had about the menu.  Our bill came out to around $450 for the 6 of us (including a 20% tip that we asked her to add), which included two sangria carafes.  I think the food alone was somewhere around $280.

The food was simply amazing, and while some of it was less stellar than others, I had an amazing time.   Headed here with my brother Edward and his girlfriend, Jackie for his birthday. I've never had tapas before really and was really looking forward to trying it.  My brother started by ordering a Perron with Cava. The cocktail menu (on the iPad) even had a short video of how to drink from it. It was a lot of fun, though we ended up wearing a bit of it.    The food was great. We ordered a lot justifying it because they had small plates and because we were treating ourselves. (Also, I paid but my brother paid for Carnevino the next day, so I knew he'd be spending more there). We ordered both of the paellas available that day - I was super excited because I don't eat seafood and all the paellas I've seen elsewhere include shellfish (yuck). Both were perfect and crispy and complex. The pork sliders were melt-in-your-mouth delicious - they literally melted in your mouth. And the terojas dessert french toast was beyond compare. Probably the best dessert I ever eaten and the best dish of the trip. The custardy bread was so soft and the crust was so awesomely caramelized that it almost was like a creme brulee but so much better.  The other highlights of the meal included: chicken croquettes, the charcuterie, the pork pressed sandwiches, the sorgbet.

The menu is vast, covering over 75 items across meat and cheese plates, land, sea, fried items and paella. Paella are made in a separate paella pit within the main dining room, allowing all diners to watch an impressive display while the paellas cook. Apparently the ventilation system alone cost $1 million, preventing all of the smoke from suffocating diners. Clearly, paella is serious business.  I've dined at restauarant-within-the-restaurant é by Jose Andres and left impressed. This would be my first visit to Jaleo proper.   Butifarra Casera Esparracada homemade pork sausage stew with mushrooms and pearl onions Carne Asada Con Piquillos 'julián De Lodosa' grilled skirt steak with piquillo pepper confit Chorizo Casero Con Puré De Patatas Al Aceite De Oliva homemade traditional chorizo with olive oil mashed potatoes and cider sauce Setas Al Ajillo Con La Serena sautéed wild mushrooms with la serena potato purée Tortilla De Patatas Clásica spanish omelet with potatoes and onions Coliflor Con Olivas Y Frutos Secos sautéed cauliflower with dates and olives Croquetas De Pollo traditional chicken fritters Costillas De Cordero Con Romesco grilled lamb ribs with romesco sauce and green onions Empanadillas De Brandada De Bacalao 'empanada' of cod brandade with honey Arroz Con Costillas De Cerdo Ibérico De Bellota made with the ribs of the famous, black-footed ibérico de bellota pig José's Tuna Salad a salad of preserved tuna, mayonnaise, shallots and hard boiled eggs on flauta bread Flauta bread brushed with fresh tomato, extra virgin olive oil and Jamón Ibérico Gambas Al Ajillo the very, very famous tapa of shrimp sautéed with garlic Vieiras Con Salsa De Romesco seared scallops with romesco sauce  My favorite dish had to be the lamb ribs, imbued with a nice smoky flavor. Tender and kind of fatty, these went down easily with the subtle heat of the romesco. Another favorite was the chicken fritters served in a shoe (fun yet awkward). Crispy on the outside and hot and fluffy on the inside, these had a delicious chicken and potato flavor to them. The skirt steak carne asada was another popular item at the table, with the tender piece of steak complemented well by sweet piquillo peppers. The paella had a bunch of very crispy bits from the pan (slightly controversial among the family), but I liked the texture and depth of flavor it brought to the dish. Overall I liked the paella, but I wanted more meat - the few pieces we had were on the bony side.  Less successful was the flauta with jamon iberico. The bread was very chewy (felt kind of stale) and the prized ham got lost in the mix. The Spanish omelette was another I wouldn't order again; the egg-potato-onion mix was a little bland and boring.  We shared a couple of desserts to complete the meal.  Flan Al Estilo Tradicional De Mamá Marisa Con Espuma De Crema Catalana a classic spanish flan with 'espuma' of catalan cream and oranges Pastel De Chocolate Y Avellanas chocolate cake with hazelnut praline ice cream and salted caramel sauce  Both desserts were simple and satisfying. The very light flan, scented with vanilla bean, was my favorite and an appropriate end to the Spanish meal. Chocolate lovers wouldn't be disappointed by the chocolate cake, however.  I found the meal at Jaleo to be good. Nothing stood out as extraordinary, but the restaurant offered a good to way sample a bunch of different Spanish flavors.

OK, the bad reviews are due to either going in the first few weeks of opening (in which all restaurants have issues) or having never been to Spain and experiencing real tapas.  This is the first time I have gone to a Spanish tapas restaurant in the US and had it taste like the flavors I tasted in Spain.  The food is amazing and prices are actually quite reasonable considering 1. it is Vegas and 2. the prices would be the same in Spain but in Euros.  If you compare it to some of the restaurants nearby then you would realize the price to food ratio is actually quite good.  We ate there 3 out of the 4 nights we were in Vegas because it was so good and even though we live in a foodie town we can't get great Spanish tapas.  Some of our favorites - the oyster  gin and tonic , gaspacho, chorizo fried potatoes (chistorra envueita en patata), tomato bread with manchego cheese, ham selection, lobster paella, and seared lamb ribs.  We also enjoyed the brussel sprout salad, lobster salad, garlic soup, and rossejat (fried pasta),   We loved everything except the raw salmon crudo (which was overpriced and lost it flavor buried in olive oil and pine nuts), the clams with lemon - which were not special and had some sand in them, and the croquettes which were the best we have had but we are not lovers of croquettes.  If you know Spanish tapas, you must try it.  If you don't, still try it but you may want to ease in with the items most Americans would love - seared lamb, garlic shrimp, croquettes, brussel sprout salad, and try some hams and cheeses.

The bruschetta was surprisingly delicious and more filing at than usual due to the large pieces of bread. The chicken dish was called Pollo al Agillo, which was a chicken leg and thigh served with a balsamic glaze of some sort. It was pretty good, but nothing to write home about.   The real standout of the meal were the croquettes. As I sat at the table I saw the waiter walking over to me with a sneaker in his hand... I'm like, you wanna hit the basketball court or something?

Rosemary Lemonade - very sour and the rosemary hits you a bit later into the drink, but I loved it.  Pan Con Tomate (with Manchego) - so good. Its perfect with manchego and I just love it. Unlike some bread/tomato/cheese starters, this was easy to eat and didn't make an embarrassing mess. So so so good.  Apple/Fennel Salad - I love anything with apple and fennel. Throw in some manchego and I'm very happy. This was probably my favorite bite of the meal.   Cod Empenadas - we were warned they were different. And they are. Its kind of like fried won ton wrappers with liquid cod and cheese inside - and drizzled with honey. (Good thing I don't write menu descriptions as that sounds disgusting - but its very good!)  Carne Asada - yum, very tender and it came with some tasty red peppers.   Bacon Wrapped Dates - I've never had a date before and didn't know they were so sweet!  These are little dates, wrapped in bacon and breaded.  Our server recommended this dish be served last as it is somewhat dessert-like. Good call.  The service was great and his recommendations for dishes were perfect - both the specific dishes themselves and the number of dishes (2-3 per person).    The drink menu was on an iPad that was left at the table to give you time to scroll and search through to find all sorts of wines, cocktails, and nonalcoholic beverages. It was fun, but kind of a silly concept as you were to select on the iPad which drinks you wanted - then you are supposed to hold up the iPad and show the server your  order page   so they can then write down your order. Then the server walks over to the computer terminal and types in your order.

His Las Vegas offerings also include é by José Andrés (a paean to molecular gastronomy) and China Poblano (Chinese and Mexican).  ***The Menu*** There are pages of tapas, so take your time perusing the list. When I went, there were a couple of specials; check with your server. Paella is available, either as a single serving of the daily special, or as one of several available if ordered for six or more people. Lastly, a caveat: while a few of the tapas are small, many are nearly entrée sized.  ***The Atmosphere*** It's a large, open space, brightly lit. There are many hard surfaces, making Jaleo a fairly noisy place; contributing to this is moderately to loud music. All in all, pretty much what you'd expect from a restaurant located in the Cosmopolitan. I ate at the bar. It seats around 15 people; the full menu is available. The bartenders, dressed all in black, are very friendly; my bartender was glad to discuss not only the drinks, but the menu.  ***The Food*** I asked the bartender whether I should order a couple of items at a time, or everything at once. He suggested I might as well order everything at once; since there were several cooking stations, dishes would tend to appear slowly, over a period of time. That's what I did, and that's what happened. In no particular order, here's what I had: **Ensaladilla rusa con atún en conserva, with optional trout roe. Yeah, this is just glorified potato and tuna salad - but it's really good potato and tuna salad. The chunks of tuna were a lot firmer and moister than Starkist; dollops of flavored mayonnaise were a nice touch; the optional trout roe was tasty. This was one of those entrée sized tapas. **La Serena con membrillo (La Serena cheese and quince paste cone). Think of this as a tiny ice cream cone (one large or two small bites), filled with a creamy cheese and quince paste. If you're familiar with mango paste, quince paste is very similar - perhaps slightly less sweet with a slight amount of bitterness. I'm not sure why, but I really enjoyed this one. **Fricandó de carilleras de ternera y puré de patatas al aceite de oliva (veal cheeks and morels with olive oil potato purée). Two large chunks of cheeks were soft and rich - just the way veal cheeks should be. Just as rich were the whipped potatoes. I liked this dish a lot, but you have to like meat that is soft and fatty. **Bacalao (salt cod; off menu special). My bartender recommended this dish. It was a special they started serving the night before. The dish consisted of a generous chunk of salt cod. Slightly chewy and salty, I liked both the texture and flavor. Accompanying it was some rich mayonnaise or aioli or some such thing. If this is still available, it's worth ordering.  ***Summary*** The Strip now has two high quality tapas bars: Jaleo and the nearby Julian Serrano. I've only had one meal at each, so it's difficult to say which is best, but I'd give the nod to Jaleo. I enjoyed my dishes slightly more, and the atmosphere is a little more upbeat. However, they're both winners.  ***The Bill*** The meal was about $60, plus drinks, tax and tip.

It is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas - consistently fantastic food and service. Incidentally, my other favorite restaurant in Vegas is China Poblano, so maybe it is a Jose Andres thing.   Yes, it is expensive. No, this should not be a surprise. Jose Andres is an award-winning chef. The menu is posted online WITH the prices listed. This is Vegas. The price you pay, however is 100% WORTH IT.   I am one of those restaurant patrons that asks a lot of questions (What's your favorite dish? What's the most popular? Would you choose __ or __? How is that prepared? What's that dish over there?) and the waitstaff always answers my questions without any attitude or annoyance. They're friendly and fast.   It is loud. Every 45 minutes or so they ring a bell and yell  Paella!  when the paella is ready. They are accommodating of groups, so large groups of people who have had too much sangria can get quite raucous. But it's also fun. Barcelona is loud. Barcelona is raucous. This is not a white-table-cloth restaurant, so don't expect that type of atmosphere. They have a foosball table as a table.. it has been my dream to one day be seated there, but I'm beginning to wonder if you maybe have to ask when you make the reservation.   Now the food....  Pan de cristal con tomate fresco - tomato bread - sounds simple, but is remarkably delicious. Reminds me of bruschetta, but with a crispier bread that doesn't hurt your teeth when you bite into it.   Jamón ibérico de bellota Fermín - fancy ham - comes with tomato bread. I am not a major ham connoisseur. I am amazed at how they can slice it so thin (by hand!).   Dátiles con tocino 'como hace todo el mundo' - bacon wrapped dates - not my favorite bacon wrapped dates around  Croquetas de pollo - chicken fritters - I was worried this would be fancy chicken fingers. Instead, it is like a pot pie wrapped in a mozzarella stick. SO GOOD. Ultimate comfort food. I wish I could eat this once a month (if you know what I mean ;)). Also, it comes served in a shoe (a Camper shoe, to be precise), which is fun.   Salmón crudo con huevas de salmón - salmon / roe cone - I really liked the cone part, but roe is so salty, so the overall effect was pretty salty. Good, but salty.  Ensalada de bogavante con cítricos y escarola - lobster & frisee salad - comes with a generous portion of lobster. I do not like frisee, but my mom loved this dish.   Coca con erizos de mar - uni toast - comes with a LOT of uni. Although, now that I'm writing this review months later, I don't really remember anything that special about it.   Rossejat - noodle paella - SO GOOD. Definitely a must-order.   Rossejat negra con cigala - squid ink rossejat - also really good, but I like the regular rossejat better. I don't know how they get the inside of the Norwegian lobster to such a creamy consistency. Be careful about letting this touch your lips, it will stain them a lovely shade of grey.   Canelones tradicionales de cerdo y hígado de pato con salsa béchamel - pork & foie gras canaloni - the ultimate indulgence. Really rich and creamy. If you are lactose intolerant, you might have a stomach ache after, but it is so worth it. This is such a rich and heavy dish, if you order this I recommend maybe selecting one item fewer than you would have.   Other notes -  I recommend the white sangria over the red.

Jaleo was our last dinner outing on a recent Vegas trip and it did not disappoint. The food was outstanding from start to finish. A trendy decor perfectly at home in the Cosmo proved to be the perfect setting for a style of dining that encourages a communal experience.  The menu spans multiple regions of Spain and showcases some of their most popular cuisine. Jamón ibérico and paella are probably the best known dishes to an American audience but Jaleo's menu goes far beyond the staples offering a unique mix with something for every palate.  The Good: Jaleo's menu features a number of different paellas, but keep in mind that they rotate on a nightly basis, also make sure to order them early as they take 45 minutes to prepare. We opted for the vegetable paella which was packed with flavor. The rice was a perfect al-dente and had a nice bite to it. The portion was a bit on the small side so be sure to order 2 if you have a larger group. The Jamón ibérico did not disappoint either. Sliced paper-thin, the fat marbled ham had a great saltiness finished with hit of acorn. Another standout were the Croquetas De Pollo (chicken fritters). They weren't unlike risotto balls I've had in the past with a molten cheese center. They were a nice balance to the bold, spicy flavors of the other dishes. Ultimately you really can't go wrong with anything on Jaleo's menu. We sampled about 10-12 dishes total and they were all outstanding. Be sure to start your meal with one of the restaurant's signature gin and tonics.  The Bad: Nothing bad to report. We did have to wait an extra 15 minutes past our reservation to be seated, but the friendly bar tenders took good care of us while we waited. The service was also a bit slow, but that's more attributed to just how busy the restaurant was. Make sure you book a table in advance.  Jaleo is a quintessentially Vegas dining experience.

There were lots of kids there as well so it isn't a place for a romantic date by any means. The wine list came on an IPAD which was cool until I saw that they only had Spanish wines by the glass. I had never heard of any of the them and had a hard time choosing. The waiter was friendly enough to suggest one based on what I like. When it came I did not like it at all. He brought me another to try and when I told him I thought it was corked he said it just had  barnyard  notes to it. Who the heck wants to drink a wine that smells like a barn? We ordered a meat sampler plates, some olives, ham croquettes, shrimp with lemon aioli and oilive salt. Everything was good, not amazing and the portions were so small even for tapas that we either each got one bite or had to cut something in half. We didn't even feel like we'd eaten anything after the first seven plates that I proceeded to quickly order 7 more. The mussels stood out but the paella was so bland and crunchy (underdone) that we had to send it back.

Similar to an omakase, we left the decision making in the hands of our waiter and the kitchen, although we mentioned a couple specific items that we wanted. Our waiter said it would be about $50 per person for the food.  What followed was a gluttonous feast of about 13 dishes plus two desserts that were almost all amazing. Our meal consisted of:  Pan con tomate (2 orders) - toasted slices of crispy bread brushed with fresh tomato Three queso (2) - cheese platter Jamon serrano (3) - 18-month salt-cured ham Espinacas (2) - sauteed spinach, pine nuts, raisins and apples Bruselas de jamon (2) - warm brussels sprouts salad with apricots, apple and serrano ham Gambas al ajillo (2) - shrimp sauteed with garlic Pulpo a feira (2) - boiled octopus with potatoes, pimenton and olive oil Mejillones al vapor (1) - steamed mussels with bay leaf, lemon and olive oil Calamares tinta (2) - seared fresh squid with squid ink sauce, artichokes and pearl onions Carne asada (2) - grilled skirt steak with piquillo pepper confit Codorniz Catalan (2) - grilled whole quail with apple puree and pinenuts Ensalada Malaguena (1) - traditional salad from malaga of Spanish cod, oranges, potato and black olives Paella Iberico (1) - made with the ribs of Iberico pigs Flan (1) - classic Spanish flan with espuma of Catalan cream and oranges Pan con chocolat (1) - chocolate cake with hazelnut praline ice cream and salted caramel sauce  The spinach dish sounds simple but the flavors that they were able to coax out of those common ingredients was unforgettable. Even if you're not a fan of those leafy greens chances are you'll love it. Other favorites were the mussels (much better than the previous time I had them), quail, and the squid, a dish as beautiful as it was delicious.  I could probably list all as my favorites because each was well executed. Some caught our attention with bold and complex flavors while others were more subtle, yet just as refined. It was an excellent mix that showcased the ingredients and the chefs' skills. The relaxed pace of the meal (about two and a half hours) gave us plenty of time to appreciate each dish and try plenty of cocktails and sangria.

The Cosmopolitan's front desk had transferred our call to Jaleo, which oversees reservations for both dining experiences. Miscommunication ensued.   The hostess was all smiles and apologies when we arrived. We were disappointed, but not shattered, seeing that Jaleo is still born from Chef José Andrés's creative mind, just less...avant garde.   Compared to The Bazaar which I had visited in Miami, Jaleo's dishes had less pizzazz and showmanship, but still utilized fine ingredients, impeccably prepared.   The menu offered a number of dishes procured from black-footed, acorn-fed pigs, like the Lomo Ibérico De Bellota Fermín, thinly-sliced cured pork loin. It was tender, rich, and flavorful.   The Arroz de pato 'Jean Luis Palladin' was an impressive take on duck on rice, smokey grilled duck breast atop creamy, short-grained rice mixed with more duck. It almost didn't need, but was accentuated by, the foie gras cream.  After some salmon roe cones, a cheese and fruit plate, and some pork mini burgers, we cleansed our palate with the Salmorejo, a chilled tomato soup garnished with a quartet of bacon bits, boiled egg, chives, and crackers. It looked like an impressionistic painting of a sunrise and tasted equally refreshing.   The only two drawbacks from this dinner was that the Mini Pepito De Ibérico (mini burgers) were too greasy, and that the service slowed considerably as the tables filled up.

They were tiny and drowing in this orange sauce.    The pork and foie gras canelones were probably the best out of all the things we ordered.  No one could detect the foie gras though.  They looked and tasted like little enchiladas so if there was foie gras, it was minced into the pork inside the canelones.

CONS - Hard to get a reservation on most nights - The menu can be intimidating - ask questions or get a tasting menu (see below)  TIPS - Order the tasting menu. Don't worry about specific dishes - they'll bring out course after course of amazing food. - If you drink beer, try the Estrella Damm - it's clean and crisp, like a Japanese beer but with more flavor. - The location in the Cosmopolitan is perfect if you are going to have drinks in one of the hotel bars or go out for an evening at Marquee Nightclub. - Fridays, Saturdays, and Mondays are the busiest nights (aside from special events or conferences).", "Date": "2014-01-03", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ada", "ReviewID": "09gwX63pw--jbBInH_bORA", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Everyone was telling me how good the food is but can be pricy.

My bank account hurts.  Jaleo has one of the largest menus I've ever seen. Factor in my inability to settle on just a few items, I will get just about everything that peaks my interest... Which unfortunately for me is everything on this massive menu T__T The food here is fabulous. It's not just delicious but creative, innovative and exciting!  Jaleo has a 5-star selection of cured meats. I personally like to start my meal with these items. I consider the embutidos to be the money-waster section of the menu. Portion sizes are small. Zero bang for your buck but oh so totally worth it. If you're feeling frisky, opt for the kobe of pork products. You only get like 5-6 slices but the cured ham from the magical unicorn pig from the isles of... gotcha! In all seriousness, get the black-footed Iberico just once. It's supposedly fed only acorns and results in meat that makes your mouth water just looking at it.  Vegetable-wise, Jaleo makes an amazing warm brussel sprouts salad with apricots, apple and serrano ham. They only use the outer leaves and they're cooked to perfection so they still have a bit of bite. Its a good enough portion for 2 but you'll want the whole bowl to yourself. Also noteworthy is their sauteed spinach. And where else can you get Liquid Olives? These little suckers are a result of some sweet molecular gastronomy. Little blobs of deliciousness that emulsify on the  palate. Sounds weird but I swear they're amazing. They're served with 'real' olives too. I'm a beet addict and always looking for new ways to prepare them. Their Beet Salad prep is 1. different from every place else (no generic roasted beets with goat cheese) and #2 has pistachios in it--the junk food of nuts.  Some of my favorite fried items include the Bacon-Wrapped Dates (nothing special but still delicious), the fried eggplant, and the Cod Empanadas (they're served with honey which makes these totally addicting!)  Seafood: Gambas al Ajillo (shrimp & garlic) and the Squid w/ Squid Ink. If you're craving mussels, order them elsewhere. The ones here are pretty uninspired.  This review is getting a little lengthy so I'll just finish the food stuff by saying the carne asada needs to be ordered. :)  How much you spend is entirely dependent on how much food it takes to satiate your appetite and how much meat you order in comparison to the potatoes.  I mean that literally and figuratively. We generally spend $50-80 per person when we come here. Most dishes run $10-20 but of course there are the outliers (like the ham and paella). And drinks are pretty pricy here too. When you have that WTF moment when you see Jose's $17 gin & tonic... trust me and Jose when we say it is THE BEST gin & tonic you will ever have in your life. Juniper Berries are the business. Plus, be endlessly entertained by the ice sphere (which I like to obsess over every time).", "Date": "2013-02-24", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Liza Faye", "ReviewID": "mW6aBlxaWYFNhII2_L8blA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Spanish Cheese Selection.

I had never heard of it and love Spanish tapas, so I was all about it!    It was a Friday night and we couldn't get seated until 10:30 (We checked at 8:00) We put our names on the waiting list and went to the chandelier bar for a few drinks. Can't say that waiting for our table was awful. When you have good company and a cool place like the chandelier bar, time seems to go by pretty fast. We headed upstairs just in time to be seated. The restaurant was jam packed. It's to be expected, the Cosmopolitan hasn't even been open a year and everyone wants to know what it's all about....the stores, the bars and most certainly the restaurants!   We were seated  outside  the actual restaurant. We were seated at the very last table - which leads right to the elevators and hotel rooms. This ended up being the best table possible! Far enough away so the restaurant clatter wasn't muffling our conversation, but still close enough so the staff was attentive and thorough. This also allowed my favorite Las Vegas past time....PEOPLE WATCHING! The jaw-dropping, eye-opening, laugh out loud out-of-towners are most certainly a sight to see! Our server and food runners were very polite, friendly, comical and efficient! One of the food runners picked up an empty glass and ended up dropping it and thus shattering it into pieces. Instead of getting flustered, he made himself the butt of the joke by saying  JOB OPENING!  I thought that was a great display of his character.   So far all seems well and you are probably wondering why I rated Jaleo only 3 stars?! First, let me be up front with you...Mama's on a budget!! So I knew going in that I didn't want to spend a lot of money and that I would be ordering my own tapas for self consumption as opposed to the family-style sharing. I told the table that I was doing my own thing and everyone was fine with that. I can't remember what everyone else ordered, but it was quite a bit! I ordered two items off the menu. I started with Manzana con hinojo y queso Manchego (Sliced apple and fennel salad with Manchego cheese, walnuts and Sherry dressing) Only $9....budget friendly, gotta love it! The size was surprising - but then again, it was meant for sharing. It wasn't small and it wasn't even medium...but decently sized. As I waited for my second item, the rest of the table had dishes coming out. I wish I could recall what the heck they ordered that came in a sneaker. YES PEOPLE....A SNEAKER! What about a sneaker suggests a food item would be more appetizing while residing in an opening of foot apparel? Yes, it was clean. Yes, it was brand new (at least from the looks of it), but why, OH WHY, would you deliver a dish in a sneaker and then say  I thought you'd enjoy it more in my gym shoe.  I get that it was meant to be comical, but I just didn't get why it would be served in a sneaker in the first place. I was eagerly anticipating my Carne asada con piquillos Julián de Lodosa (Grilled hanger steak with piquillo pepper confit). I though for $14, it would be a decent size...especially for family-style sharing. This is where my hugest disappointment resides. The dish was horribly undersized. It was one small piece of hanger steak that was cut into fourths. The pepper was a least two times the size of the steak....would you like some steak with that pepper? I understand that the portion sizes are meant to be more of a tasting menu, but you would think that they would give you a little more, especially with a family-style setting. It was quite delicious and it left me wanting more....oh the inner workings of the restaurant business to get you to spend more of your hard earned dough!   Overall, it was a decent experience. I'd say have dinner somewhere else (more reasonably priced) and if you want to snack later, it would be suitable.", "Date": "2011-07-21", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Tim", "ReviewID": "ZYKtaQXDKLLc8fsUqKmUgA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "How many ways can a restaurant use Jamon Iberico.

My complaint - I am tired of Croquetas. They may be traditional buut no matter where I have them, I really hate them and unfortunately Jaleo is no exception.

I like to try places that I don't have the opportunity to at home. Jose Andres' Jaleo is not in New York and was recently listed in the top 100 restaurants in the country. Having been to many places on the list, Jaleo was the first reservation we made for this trip.   Jaleo is served tapas style and has many modern takes on old classics some were exceptional (the chicken wing special with sherry reduction and a blue cheese)  others fell a little flat to me (patatas bravas) and others way over salted (lobster paella). The best part of Jaleo was the table seated next to us. Terance and Alfonso, two brothers from California. We shared some food with them so we were all able to try some bites of food we otherwise wouldn't have ordered.  Boys, don't forget to get in touch when you come to NYC!  Wings with blue cheese on the rim (the best thing we ate here)  All in all, Jaleo was just very ok, and in my opinion, not top 100 restaurants in the country good.

This trip was no different as we started off the weekend by dining here at Jaleo.  Can't beat a weekend filled with gambling and fine dining.  After the shitty 6 hour drive out to Vegas plus the 112+ degeree weather we had to deal with, dinner at Jaleo was definitely worth the suffering.  This restaurant was packed and luckily we were able to make reservations a week before.  Doubt anyone was seated without a table.    There was only one negative point to our dinner which was the fact that patrons couldn't order any paella they wanted.  Apparently, the chef determines what paella to make and the order in which he does so.  At the time we were seated, we were disappointed to find out that he was making the chicken and rabbit paella next and the server wasn't sure when he was going to make the lobster paella.  The lobster paella was the sole reason for us dining here on a Friday night.  We started the meal off with the croquetas de pollo http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A?select=doBDden97_QWUQ90g3fahQ#doBDden97_QWUQ90g3fahQ.  I had just recently dined at Racion in Pasadena and thought that the croquetas were amazing there until I had the ones at Jaleo.  OMFG were they delicious!  They are served inside a shoe which added a fun aspect to the presentation.  Perfectly fried to a golden crisp and surprisingly they were not oily.  A must order when dining here.  Huevo frito con caviar http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A?select=doBDden97_QWUQ90g3fahQ#rcJVfsQ828Px9z1QGseU1g.  Probably my least favorite dish as I'm not a caviar person.  Though the egg was perfectly cooked (with a runny yolk), I thought that the caviar left a strong fishy after taste in my mouth.  Ensalada de coles de bruselas con albaricoques, manzanas y jamon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A?select=doBDden97_QWUQ90g3fahQ#zfhsQwFmrz73uw3ejHSdcw.  I'm not a brussel sprout person and still thought that this dish was tasty.  Perhaps it was the bits of jamon they used to give a nice saltiness to the dish or it's the fact that I'm starting to like them....I'll have to say it was the jamon!    Rossejat http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A?select=doBDden97_QWUQ90g3fahQ#5NoVIJuIihu5NBs2MGfHJw.  After hearing the disappointing news about the lobster paella, we decided to order this instead after hearing that it was a specialty dish that Chef Andres makes.  It was pretty good though I thought that the squid actually had a strong fishy taste.  Again, I do have a pretty sensitive palate when it comes to fishy tasting seafood.  I'm more of a meat person so though the noodles were cooked perfectly, the squid sort of killed it for me.  Mini pepito de iberico http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A?select=doBDden97_QWUQ90g3fahQ#T0TizmLVjT3tF3kTRO439g.  Not sure which iberico dish to order, we settled for this one.  My complaint was with the timing as it didn't show up until near the end of our meal, making it difficult to consume as we were stuffed.  Wished we had a few more mouths to help out with all the food we ordered.  The mini pork burgers were good but ended up skipping out on the bread and just eating the pork patty.  Secreto iberico con pan tomate y salsa verde http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A?select=doBDden97_QWUQ90g3fahQ#ZCU0locj942eufdlsI9tnA.  Hands down the best dish of the night!  Perfectly cooked and seasoned!  This skirt steak from the iberico pork is to die for.  It came out still warm and boy did each piece melt in your mouth.  It was so good that for a brief few minutes, I forgot how full I really was until most of the plate was gone.  Oh and the pan con tomate was awesome!  After devouring the plate of the secreto, the waiter came back with some exciting news!  Turns out that the chef just finished cooking the lobster paella.  Being too full to even consider ordering a plate of it, we asked for a sample http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A?select=doBDden97_QWUQ90g3fahQ#1qw63ZI6jhTaG-pMhU_NSg.  The waiter brought out two spoons of the freshly cooked paella and holy shit was this good!  If not having been so full, I would've gladly ordered a plate.  This paella is by far the best I've ever had.    We were given some advice on how to book our next reservations and hopefully we'll be able to order a plate of the lobsert paella.

I had the Lobster Paella.  Phenomenal!  A whole lobster on your plate with cuttle fish & chorizo.  The spices were definitely shipped from Espana.    La Sirena con membrillo was a small cone that tasted like some kind of creamy and slightly tarty cheese that I've never tried before.    Salmon crudo huevas salmon cones were a trip.  A salty poppy crisp from a tiny little cone shaped treat.  It fooled you because it looked like a raspberry ice cream cone but had such an umami flavor that lingers and matures into something you'll remember fondly.  At the time there was a Sea Urchin dish that had a raspberry foam.  Wow now that was a first!  Creamy oceanic Uni mixed with a light and frothy pink sweetness.  Woah!  Hope they still have that on the menu..  We had some Salmon Cream Cheese Rangoons.  They liked to play around with what you're used to and make it otherworldly.  This place was amazing when it first opened.  I don't see many of these dishes on the online menu anymore?   Another one not on the menu anymore was a braised lamb rack.  Savory and buttery tender perfect.    There were Crab meat Stuffed Peppers.  Also some strange olive oil pur'e horderves.  The entire experience was mind expanding.

After wandering the strip looking for a worthy restaurant I stumbled in to Jaleo. First things first.  Order a gin and tonic, they are amazing.  I was skeptical, given that it is a Tapas restaurant, but do yourself the favor and order one.  I also found myself drinking some wine that was good, but not mind blowing (like the G&T's). The food is awesome, if you have not been to Spain before order a bunch of dishes from all over the place.  I always recommend paying for pork, and theirs is top notch, definitely the high quality stuff.  I like the Jamon Serrano, but find one that is in your price range and enjoy placing it in your mouth and letting it melt like butter. Skip the Paella, it looks good and the fire is a neat little bit of flair but I wasn't impressed and found it to be the most overpriced item I ordered.  I can't really remember any of the other dishes I had, but everything else was good to great, with the Ham, and the Gin and Tonic being my stand out favorites and the Paella being good, but not on par with everything else.

The lobster Pallea was out of this world and the calamari was excellent. The only miss is the fact that they don't give you any bread to soak up the delicious sauces. After the first round of traditional sangria we went for the white cava fish bowl which packs a good kick and is crisp and refreshing.  It went very well with the monkfish. On the other hand, the food was so phenomenal that after we were full, we saw a tapa dish at another table and still ordered it and desert. Lastly we ordered the flan and the tangerine custard came with a sherbet, whip cream and a couple of slices.  It was fantastic!!!

I did not have to pay to eat here; and as such, money is not the reason I'm unhappy about Jaleo.  But, I couldn't IMAGINE if I DID pay to eat here, for how SUBSTANDARD they are.  Even DISREGARDING MONEY, this place is a joke & a failure.  When you consider money, it becomes absurd.   Food portions are smaller than bite-size ($10 for a piece of cheese the size of two fingers).  You WILL leave hungry, unless you are anorexic.  Worst of all, the TASTE/QUALITY of the food is below-average.  For example, the paella was a scoop of OVERLY SALTY and greasy poorly-made rice, with three tiny (bony!) pieces of dry meat.  Drinks -- gin & tonic -- tastes like a regular  gin & tonic.   LMAO.  But the bourbon drink was better, at least.  Service -- our waitress gave us bad vibes.  She was unhappy.  SUPER ANNOYING.  She would ask us questions like  everything ok?  while we were talking (interrupting us).  Then, she would be gone for a long time, and we'd have trouble getting basic things.  Decor -- really lame.  Not interesting.  The only interesting thing are the kitchens, because of the BBQ & fire.  Too bad what comes out of them sucks! :(  I REALLY WANTED TO LOVE this place, but it's such a failure.  Unless they change things drastically, it won't be there much longer than a year.  Mark my words!  In the casino, I saw a small group of people put down somewhere between $30,000 to $40,000 on a roulette table (at one time), and then losing it all, with one roll of the wheel.  But you see, that didn't disturb them, and I know why:  roulette is clearly a game of chance, and they knew that.  When I chose to gamble at whatever games I chose, I went into those situations knowing it was just that -- a gamble.  But, dinner at Jaleo:  disappointing and frustrating!  Because the bottom line is, the food is NOT GOOD, and the portions are tiny.  Thus, I left hungry and disappointed.  I'd even have eaten bad food because I was hungry, ha ha.  It's amazing how you can go to Burgr and get a world-class burger that is completely fulfilling and incredible for, like, $14, but at Jaleo, the tab goes into the HUNDREDS for just two people-- just for appetizers and simple drinks.  (Remember! -- I didn't have to pay for my  experience  there).  There are lots of great reviews for Jaleo, but remember:   If a thousand people say a dumb thing, it's still a dumb thing.   In my case, I have no connections to this place, and no reason to give it any specific rating.  I'm just being honest.    I know that, being human, most people are blinded by advertising and their high expectations, and are therefore biased.  Also, most people (at least ones I know), find it conflicting to realize they didn't like some food after they pay hundreds of dollars for it.

Since I've eaten at Jaleo back in my home state, I figured this Jaleo would either be of the same quality or better. I ended up feeling that the tapas back at home were better. Here's what I had:  1. Berenjenas con miel de caña al estilo Malagueño (Lightly battered eggplant Málaga style) - This was surprisingly good. It was lightly crispy and slightly sweet. The eggplant was had a great texture where it would melt in your mouth. Nicely done.  2. Ensalada de coles de Bruselas con albaricoques, manzanas y jamón S(errano Warm Brussels sprouts salad with apricots, apple and Serrano ham) - I am not a fan of brussels sprouts so I didn't enjoy the first couple bites. However, after that, I started to really enjoy this salad and how it mixed salty, sweet, and bitter flavors together. Nicely executed. The pieces of ham were delightful. :)  3. Vieiras con salsa de romesco (Seared scallops with romesco sauce) - This was my FAVORITE of the meal. It was perfectly seared, juicy, and fresh tasting. The sauce complemented the scallops very well. Too bad you only get two pieces. :( Also, lovely presentation.  4. Codorniz a la Catalana (Grilled whole quail with apple purée and pinenuts) - Great flavor. It was juicy but the breast was slightly dry. That didn't bug me though because I imagine it's quite difficult to cook a quail (such a tiny bird!) perfectly. Nice presentation too.  5. Arroz a banda con bogavante (Literally meaning, 'rice apart from lobster,' made with lobster and cuttlefish) - We had the 1/2 lobster. The lobster was succulent (a little sad it didn't have much meat) but the rice itself was incredibly salty. Even in small bites, it tasted very salty. I think they may have accidentally seasoned it too much, but it was difficult to finish the plate. I was also too tired to complain and the dish had such beautiful presentation.  Service: Our waiter was a mix of aloof, aggressive, and somewhat helpful. lol. He really pushed to have us order 3-5 tapas per person and specific tapas that he preferred but we really didn't need to eat that much. We also accidentally spilled water over half of the table, and I was surprised that the waiter didn't notice that we had used all our napkins to wipe up the mess before assisting. Rather, someone else (I think busboy) swooped in quickly and helped us out. The waiter then came by with two napkins, gave my husband one replacement napkin while I stared in disbelief as he walked away with the other napkin. He then turned around after about 10 seconds to give me the other napkin in his hand. I'm not quite sure what happened, but I'm thinking maybe the loud music/business of the restaurant made him tired. *shrugs* I do think the busboy provided outstanding service. He was extremely helpful and attentive. I think he came by our table to sincerely check on us more often than the waiter. We also ordered the paella with cuttlefish, not lobster, but the lobster paella arrived at our table. o_O  Atmosphere: This restaurant is VERY LOUD. Mostly from the music that is playing which in turn increases the chatter level of the patrons. The ceiling speakers are everywhere, so there isn't a quieter spot. The decor was beautiful, modern, and festive, and I enjoyed the interactive nature of the restaurant with the few open kitchens. I loved watching the chefs/cooks prepare the tapas.  Bottom line: Although I had a great time dining at the restaurant, I am disappointed by the meal because I felt that the service and taste was much better at the Jaleo in DC.", "Date": "2012-09-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Claire", "ReviewID": "hO0ZS-k4EgXAz6ZOhjs5sQ", "Overall": "1", "Content": "We went here for our wedding anniversary.

Food: We shared 5 plates... the Cristal bread was crispy and lightly spread with tomato and alioli... it was nice that it stayed crispy for the 20/25 minutes it was on our table and didn't get soft/mushy. There Patatas Bravas had a cute presentation with the alioli on each tiny potato on a bed of the tomato sauce. The sausage stuffed squid took a while (maybe 25 minutes) but it was delicious... perfectly cooked soft squid like a pillow and just the right seasoning in the sausage. The squid and hangar steak were our favorites. The steak we got cooked medium rare (I'm still transitioning him away from well done red meat) and it was delicious. It had just a tiny amount if blue cheese as well which I don't think is listed on the menu (but our server mentioned it). We were divided on the peppers stuffed with goat cheese and mushrooms... I wasn't a huge fan, but my husband liked it.   My only warning sounds so dumb, but IT'S TAPAS!! While we were there a man started complaining about the price and size of the dishes. If you don't know what tapas is, the easiest way to explain is appetizers for dinner... you order 2-3 things per person, we typically do 4-5 for the two of us. It isn't cheap, but that isn't a Vegas thing, it was very comparable to our favorite hole in the wall place in a not so great area of the city.

We came here for an early dinner (victims of decided to eat here on a Saturday on the preceding Thursday - or perhaps the beneficiaries of this decision - more on this later).  The drink list comes out on an iPad, which is a bit precious. You can save your time and just order Jose's Gin and Tonic for your first drink - trust me, you won't be let down! Gin and Fever Tree tonic, presented in a wine glass containing exactly one spherical ice cube and garnished with juniper berries, a slice of lemon, and lemon verbena goes down smooth - what's not to like there? Nothing.   As a party of six, we headed the waiters advice and ordered 2-3 items per person - a few at a time, starting with the pan con tomate and progressing  from there to meats and cheeses, on to vegetables and seafood, and finally to some meat dishes. We ended up ordering additional orders of a few items , such as the gambas al aljilio and the brussel sprout salad. These are items not to miss.  Other standout items include the olives (including 'liquid' olives, a simple delight of molecular gastronomy) and the secreto Iberico, which we ordered at the very land, when we were still just a little hungry - and ended up devouring. All of this food went perfectly with a well-priced Rioja.  Dessert was a bit of a hit and a bit of a miss. The flan tradicional was one of the best specimens of that dish that I've ever had. In fact, self proclaimed haters of flan were devouring it along with the rest of us. The cafe solo (espresso) is the best I've had outside of Italy. The big down was the apple tart - which wasn't really very apple-y or tarty. We could have done with out this.  This was a slow, pleasant meal.

When they lead you to your table, you will pass the station where they cook those expensive paellas. We got the Eggplant Malaga style ($9), Rossejat ($20), Gambas Al Ajillo ($16), and Spanish Flan with 'espuma' of Catalan cream and oranges ($12). The eggplant dish was pretty much 3 donuts stuffed with eggplant and honey drizzled over. It tasted good but paying 9 bucks is way overpriced. The Rossejat was like (filipino reference alert) pancit with small shrimp and a spoonful of mayo. It tasted ok but I wouldn't order that again. The Gambas were best tasting with the garlic and tomato sauce. The sauce was so good that I had to use the complimentary to finish it (hey, it was $16). The flan was good with the oranges and something crunchy that they put on the cream to give the dish some crispy texture. Would I come back again? Yes I would but only to try the paellas.

They push $20 signature cocktails, which is outlandish, and I felt silly even succumbing to a $15 alternative, which was surprisingly weak. The croquetas de pollo, while delicious and well prepared for fried food, were gone in an instant and felt cheap, like they should half cost at least a few dollars less. Eating them out of a sneaker (yes really) didn't help make them feel expensive. We went into it knowing it would be a splurge (they recommend two or three of these tiny selections per person).

At around 6pm, we were able to get seated immediately. Our Waiter came just as soon as the Hostess seated us and offered to get drinks. He seem knowledgeable about the menu when asked, and offered great options on what we needed to get to compliment our dishes.  Pulpo A Feira Maestro Alfonso, boiled Octopus w/pee wee potatoes sprinkled with Spanish Paprika and Olive oil alone was much too salty, however, when eating with Pan De Cristal Con Tomate Fresco, toasted ethereal bread brushed with fresh tomato, it balanced out salt with the acidity of the tomatoes perfectly.   Aceitunas Rellenas Y Aceitunas 'Ferrán Adrià' , Olive stuffed Anchovies and liquid olives was by far my favorite tapas, EVER. I absolutely loved every single bite of this dish.   Arroz de pato 'Jean Luis Palladin', Rice w/duck confit, foie cream & PX Reduction was just so so. The rice was cooked well, but bland as well as duck. The Foie cream was on a sweet side and lack that awesome livery, minerally taste of foie I've grown to love.  The waiter forgot to put in some other appetizers and our Rossejat, traditional paella of fried pasta with fresh squid and shrimp w/a dallop of garlic aioli sauce, so we had to wait about 15 minutes for this dish but it was so delicious! Well worth the wait. I know that some patrons have had bad experience with the rice in the Paella not being thoroughly cooked, this dish is the best solution to that problem! Traditionally, paella can take up to 45 minutes, if you don't want to wait that long, opt for this dish. It has all the great tastes of Paella but less the time.

Saltiness aside, the food was generally not made well.  (a) Brussel sprouts were torn apart into pieces and presented with citrus fruits as a summer-y salad type dish. Cute efforts, bad execution. The pairing failed and I was left with one of the most weird Brussel sprouts ever.  (b) Paella rice was 3/4 of the way done and so some portions of the rice were crunchy and undercooked... If you are a tapas place, you'd think paella is like their bread and butter... (c) Salad was way too sweet and the dressing was almost like some kind of fruit juice or syrup... (c) Lobster? What lobster? When one of the dishes with lobster came out, we were presented the skinniest pieces of  shrimp  that had almost zero edible parts, that was way below the acceptable level of any shell fish presentation.

I recently joined a friend for dinner at Jaleo, and it was a fabulous experience from start to finish.  We arrived a little early for our 8pm reservation, so the hostess let us wait at the bar, where we each tried one of the bartender's recommendations (Berroja white for me, and a gin and tonic for my guest).  It was a perfect place to soak in the vibrant, upbeat, bright interior.  It's a nice change of pace from the darker and more overtly sexified dining destinations elsewhere in the Cosmo dining district (STK and Scarpetta come to mind).    After we were seated at a prime two-top near the front of the restaurant, I decided I wanted to have a dinner experience different from the ultramodern, molecular gastronomy-heavy experience at é.  Our server recommended the  Jaleo Experience  -- a traditional tapas-style prix fixe feast for 2 for $55.  I was sold right away.  It's a mountain of amazing food at a reasonable price.  Here's the rundown of the dishes, all of which were perfect for sampling and sharing:  1) Pan de cristal con tomate fresco -- classic-style fresh tomato on bread. 2) Jamón ibérico de bellota Fermín -- ham from Iberico pigs with crunchy crackers. 3) Manchego flor de esqueva -- tasty sheep (Manchego) cheese. 4) Tichi's gazpacho -- cold gazpacho soup with tomatoes, cucumbers, and peppers. 5) Cono de atun -- cone of tuna tartare with piqullo and sesame seeds. 6) Pimientos del piquillo rellenos de queso Caña de Cabra -- piquillo peppers stuffed with goat cheese. 7) Dátiles con tocino 'como hace todo el mundo'  -- bacon-wrapped dates with apple/mustard sauce. 8) Paella de pollo -- classic-style paella with chicken. 9) Escalivada catalana -- fire-roasted red peppers, eggplant, and sweet onions. 10) Chorizo casero con puré de patatas al aceite de oliva -- crispy chorizo with potato purée and cider sauce. 11) Pan con chocolate -- chocolate custard with caramelized bread, olive oil, and brioche ice cream.  There were so many highlights to this meal that I don't even know where to begin. The pan con tomate was so fresh and vibrant.  The jamón ibérico was rich and decadent.  The gazpacho was tangy and creamy.  The paella was a wonderful mix of flavors and textures, from the perfectly cooked chicken to the crunchy rice.  The chorizo was fatty perfection, on top of some of the silkiest mashed potatoes I've ever had.  The dessert was sweet but complex.  The recurring theme was olive oil.  There was olive oil in virtually every dish, which tied the courses together in a beautiful way.  Olive oil even featured prominently in the pan con chocolate dessert -- and let me say that olive oil + chocolate is a fabulous combination that I'm eager to try again ASAP.  Service was fantastic too.  In addition to our main server, there was a veritable small army of people bringing plates in and out, and refilling our water at a moment's notice.  Not too shabby since the two of us were a pair of low-rollers sharing a single and inexpensive tasting menu.    The verdict: Jaleo lives up to the stratospherically high standard set by é.  For a traditional Spanish meal, you just can't do better -- whether you're in the Cosmo or elsewhere.  Nicely done, Chef Andrés!

You feel excited sitting there and wait in anticipation to try the food.   So here's the food breakdown  Selection of all cheeses   18. Pasamontés  Manchego, Idiazábal, Murcia al vino, Garrotxa, Caña de cabra, La Peral       * Delicious! Came with Fresh Raisens on the vine, dried apricots and roasted almonds ---  Jamón Ibérico de bellota 'Fermin' Cured ham from the legendary, acorn-fed,Black footed Ibérico pigs of Spain   22       * This was the best ham I've ever had. And it had better be for over $5 a micro-thin slice. All 5 pieces makes up one regular piece of bacon. That's one expensive piece of bacon! ---  Ajo blanco con cangrejo Chilled almond and garlic soup with crabmeat and green grapes  12       * This definitely took a bit of getting used to. I love vinegar, and that's a good thing considering that's exactly what this tasted like. Vinegar with Cream with little bits of fresh lobster and grape halves.  ---  Piquillo relleno de 'txangurro' Piquillo peppers stuffed with Dungeness crabmeat  14       * 2 pieces. This was pretty hearty. The peppers were nothing special but the sauce and crab were yummy.  ---  Gambas al ajillo The very, very famous tapa of shrimp sautéed with garlic  10       * 5-6 shrimp. AWESOME! Favorite so far  Trigueros con romesco Grilled asparagus with romesco sauce  12       * Nothing special. 5 spears of asparagus. Plain sauce ---  Huevo frito con caviar A fried organic egg topped with caviar  16       * This just tasted like a poached egg that you dip bread into. The caviar was so light you could not taste it unless you ate it seperately.  ---  Carne asada con piquillos Julián de Lodosa Grilled hanger steak with piquillo pepper confit  14       * 7 slices, 3-4oz? Again, nothing special. Cooled perfectly.   ---  Canelones tradicionales de cerdo, hígado de  pato y trufas con salsa bechamel Pork, foie gras and truffle canelones with bechamel sauce  14       * This was absoloutely my fav after the shrimp. A bit salty but Mmm! Warm and hearty, the truffle flavor standing out. Delicious! ---  Lobster Paella 28       * Total disappointment. The presentation was gorgeous, the Paella tasted like rice cooked in the juices of lobster, extremely salted. We left more than half of it on the plate. We ate the half tail and claw.    I really wanted to try the Sangria but they do not sell by the glass, another disappointment.

Located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo is a mix of amazing places to eat with Jaleo holding up the growing Tapas category. The entrance to Jaleo is inviting and enticing and holds a level of energy not seen by most eateries on a Tuesday evening. Just walking in and sitting at the bar, I knew we were in for a treat. Just as the rest of the Cosmo, no level of detail went underlooked inside this Spanish Tapas endevor. From the Tapas Kitchen mid dining room, to the wood burning circle kitchen right next to the bar, Jaleo's let's you marvel in the mastery of culinary design by seeing how it's made right before your eyes.  At the bar, we ordered two drinks, I had a Tomato infused something or other that was out of this world, very pricey for the serving size, but worth having at least once. My friend ordered a glass of champagne which was also good I was told, but also on they high side for price vs. Volume. That aside, it was time to order. We got the Bacon Wrapped Dates, the Potato Chips with white and red sauce, Chirizo Wrapped with Potato chips, White Asparagus, and the Conejo (Rabbit).  To make this easy, I'll simply break it down: Bacon Wrapped Dates: A typical order for us from Firefly, so we wanted to compare. The presentation was definitely not what we were expecting, but very fun to experience. They come served in a tennis shoe from a brand that we were told is the  Adidas of Spain . Aside from the off the wall plating, the Dates were amazing. The difference is, they deep fry the bacon wrapped dates so the whole bite is moist and flavorful with more of a hint of bacon and the richness of the date compared to most places where the bacon wins the flavor battle. A+ Potato Chips with Red and White sauce: A simple dish with lots to love. The chips seemed freshly made and the sauces had a good contrast to each other. Being so fresh, the chips had less crunch than you'd normally expect, but I saw it as a good thing. Not mushy, just less crunch and more smooth textures. B+ Choirzo Wrapped in Potato Chips: Simple, yet delightful. It is what it is, delicious Spanish chorizo, fresh potato chip, and a toothpick. Pick it up, bite, and enjoy. Simplicity at it's best, and tastiest. A White Asparagus: This was served inside a sardine-can-like tin sprinkled with a bit of cheese. The fresh crunch of each bite, cut by the slight bitterness of the cheese made each tiny serving seem like so much more. A Conejo (Rabbit): Something that's definitely not on everyone's top choices to try, but should. This was a leg and ribs serving with an apricot compote that was light and rich with enough sweetness to nicely balance the supreme flavors of the juicy Rabbit. If you've never tried Rabbit before, this is the one to try. It is not off putting at all, and will make you wish you could have it every day if you could! A+ To finish us off, we figured we'd indulge and have the Chocolate Hazelnut Cake. What a work of art this dessert was. I would've paid for just one bite of it. The chocolate and hazelnut combination they use is an absolute marrige commencing on your pallet. It was so good, I'd go there to just order that! A+ I thank the Cosmopolitan for choosing such an outstanding Tapas joint. I can't wait to try more of the menu. Hopefully over time, Jaleo's gets a happy hour or local's night, but even until then, this will be my new place to enjoy Tapas with friends and family.", "Date": "2011-01-22", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Stephanie", "ReviewID": "jREk7_okoEZXGKRd5hkAJw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Erika, our waitress was perfection.

The whole idea of tapas is to try small portions of a number of different types of food at lower prices. Jaleo provides smaller portions but doesn't have as wide a variety of food as one would hope for and definitely doesn't have the lower prices.   Jaleo then suffers from another problem - they fry just about every dish. Spanish food is not necessarily heavy or populated by fried items, but Jaleo's menu is just loaded up with fried options when it simply doesn't need to be. Even the datillos con tocino (dates with bacon - an absolute tapas staple) is fried. i've never seen that, why ruin the dish by frying it?  Because of that maybe the best dish we had was the sliced apple and fennel salad - it was just so fresh and such a welcome, refreshing change. The other dish that was very good was the skirt steak with piquillo peppers - another common Tapas dish - that was done well.

Portions were exceedingly small, prices were high, and flavors were muted . . . not a good combination for a celebrated restaurant.    I love tapas and thus was excited to try lots of different plates.  On my visit I tried the King Crab with diced peppers, the Serrano Ham, the Gin & Tonic Oysters, the Patatas Bravas, the Shrimp sautéed with garlic, the Squid & Shrimp Paella, the Seared Scallops with Romesco Sauce, the Pork Sausage Stew, and the Grilled Skirt Steak with Piquillo Pepper Confit.  Most of the dishes I tried were good but not great.  That being said, The Gin & Tonic Oysters were unique and pretty good as was the Patatas Bravas.  Rather than severing traditional Patatas Bravas, Jose Andres provided his own take on the dish which consisted of potato chips covered with a romesco ketchup and aioli.  The star dish of the evening was the Grilled Skirt Steak with Piquillo Pepper Confit.  The steak was cooked perfectly and was beautifully accented by the Piquillo Pepper Confit which provided just a touch of heat and a wonderful roundness of flavor.  Too bad the portion was minuscule and gone in four bites.

With so many wonderful internationally recognized chef owned restaurants located on the Strip, we returned to Jose Andrés' Jaleo for a Spanish lunch. We had just arrived into Las Vegas only a few hours prior to our noontime reservation and we were excited for a taste of paella and other tapas.    Our server, Jason, greeted us with friendly familiarity and described the lunch menu as an abbreviated or highlighted dinner menu that we were familiar with from previous dines. We started with cocktails and ordered their 3-course lunch special. Jason piqued my interest with a cocktail called  Con Membrillo  that was a Seasonal concoction of quince paste, rum, egg white and nutmeg. There were probably more ingredients in that cocktail that I don't just remember listing.  But, after a couple of smooth sips, I was transported to Madrid's Plaza Mayor in Fall. My husband ordered a Spanish beer, Estrella Damm Inedit Witbier to begin his  journey .  Meanwhile, our order of Jamón Ibérico Fermín with picos arrived.  It was a small plate of porky deliciousness that melted like butter as soon as it hit your tongue. The paper-thin slices were paired with crisp  picos  or mini breadsticks.  We both ordered the Complete Spanish Lunch that was a 3-course meal. It started with Ensalada Verde (Bibb lettuce, red onions and sherry dressing), Gazpacho estilo Algeciras (classic chilled Spanish soup made with tomato, cucumber, peppers and bread) and Paella del Dia (today's special featured chicken and mushrooms). It was a value for its price at $26 per person. Jason brought out each course in a timely succession...we weren't in a rush and had the time to savor the flavors. The food was well-seasoned and we were seated to watch the chef prepare the paella over the open-fire wood burning grill.

We ordered several suggested dishes only to be underwhelmed and unimpressed at the beginning of our meal, but as we branched out and tried some of the more exotic choices, the quality and experience improved sharply. Learn from our mistakes!  PLAY IT SAFE PAN DE CRISTAL CON TOMATE FRESCO: toasted bread with fresh tomato. Tasty but very basic, kick it up to something that's actually worth getting by adding Manchego cheese or anchovies. JAMON IBERICO FERMIN: if you're going to come here, you may as well try the famous ham. It's not all that much different from prosciutto, in my opinion. We were underwhelmed. COLIFLOR CON OLIVAS Y FRUTOS SECOS: the contrasting flavors of the dates and olives was enjoyable, but the roasted cauliflower that forms the base of the dish was treated as an afterthought.  CROQUETAS DE POLLO: described as chicken fritters and served inside of a shoe, this will add some excitement to an otherwise tame table of dishes. One in our party described this dish as  like a mini hot pocket of chicken pot pie . It was tasty, but not the standout menu item other reviews (or even our server) made it out to be. ARROZ CON COSTILLAS DE CERDO IBERICO DE BELLOTA Y ALCACHOFA: The pig-rib paella is tasty but not particularly adventurous. This is the only paella I've ever had where the rice was extremely crispy- I am not sure if it was overcooked, if we just got the bottom of the batch, or if it was intentional, but I did not particularly like it.   GO FOR THE GOLD JOSE ANDRES GIN & TONIC: $20 for a G&T is ridiculous, but luckily it is also ridiculously good. ACEITUNAS RELLENAS Y ACEITUNAS  FERRAN ADRIA : Olives two ways! One is stuffed with pimiento and anchovies, the other is a liquid olive using molecular gastronomy cooking techniques. It's essentially a flavored bubble and fairly fun to experience. BUNELOS DE BACALAO: Deep-fried salt codfish with honey aioli. The sauce is unlike anything else I've had, and the crispy fried fish is well-executed without being greasy. CAZON FRITO: AKA SHARK NUGGETS! I love this dish. Fried thresher shark with a garlic aioli. I've never had shark but now I'm definitely interested in trying other versions. This was battered without being crispy, fried without being greasy, and simple without disappointing. Would get again! PULPO ASADA CON CREMA CEBOLLA: Perfectly-charred grilled octopus, served with green cherry tomatoes, onion puree, and garlic oil. This was fantastic, the entire table considered it a top dish. Must order! COSTILLAS DE CORDERO MORUNO: Succulent grilled rack of lamb with parsley oil. Simple but amazing. One of my favorite versions of lamb in Vegas. PASTEL DE CAFE:  Chocolate, coffee, and hazelnut tart with coffee rum ice cream.  The menu description doesn't do it justice at all. The base is like a crunchy cookie, topped with pure coffee-chocolate deliciousness, then a smooth ice cream with a delicious sauce on the plate. An indulgent, coffee-lovers dessert.  We ordered the dishes above in nearly this exact order. Total with tax and tip was just over $250, for a filling dinner for a group of three.

This place had a nice ambiance and the sangria was spot on - light, fruity, and a plenty. The staff was also friendly but eek! Those were the only good things about this place.  Way to add insult to injury by making everything SUPER SALTY! This is some kind of ironic Vegas joke to put (actual) salt on our wounds, our bellies, and gouging us.  Items that were ordered with their online menu descriptions (5 total):   1. Chistorra envuelta en patata frita  Slightly spicy chorizo wrapped in crispy potato : chorizo was underwhelming. Presentation looked like a tiny hot dog wrapped in a greasy potato chip. Probably didn't help also that it was served in a mini fry basket.  I had to have my fiancé eat the rest.   2. Gambas al ajillo  The very, very famous tpaa of shrimp sautéed with garlic : Wow. I don't know why they put an emphasis on  very . That must mean that it's very very good right? Wrong. It was just okay. Each shrimp got progressively saltier. They provided a cute bread loaf with the dish, but I didn't want to dip it in the greasy juice. That should have been our first warning sign. Also - please spell  tapa  right on your website, Jaleo.   3. Arroz con costillas de cerdo ibérico de bellota  Made with the ribs of the legendary, black-footed ibérico de bellota pigs of Spain : these legendary pigs from Spain must have been raised in a tight space and didn't eat much. They were 95% all fat and bone. Mushrooms were decent, but over salted. This paella was probably not the worst dish of the night, so we ended up eating most of it.   I'm not going to get into too much detail on the last two dishes: mushrooms with creamy sauce and a lentil dish with pork (not located on their website...coincidence - I think not!) because we sent those 2 back. They were incredibly salty and surpassed the threshold of the benefit of the doubt - yes we turned into those people!

It's difficult to get them to agree to a large dinner, and when they do, you have to do a tasting course. When you do the tasting course you have to sign a contract. If you sign the contract you guarantee the # of folks in your party.  In our case, half the table decided they didn't want to eat and so they walked out. This left me arguing with the F&B manager for the night, who produced a copy of the contract - that was oddly missing the page where I wrote that the size of the party could change (and signed off on by the F&B manager for the restaurant)  I seriously argued with this person for over 20 minutes going back and forth as to the best course of action, while all my guests sat waiting. On my birthday dinner.   Eventually we reached a draw and decided to just eat. So the food started coming and it was actually AMAZING! It has been a minute so I forget ALL the courses but here are the ones I remember:  - the bruschetta w/ tomato - amazing. I still think about it.  - dates w/ bacon  - the paella of course  Unfortunately there were more issues...after the first 4-5 courses came out, we sat for 30 minutes without a single additional course coming. This was actually a good thing (wait and see). After pointing out to the waiter that no food was coming to our table, he went back to the kitchen and did something because orders started coming out, but not in the order on the menu. My guess would be that the kitchen fell behind on our table, got yelled at, and fired whatever they could get immediately. So props to them for getting things moving.  Dessert was delicious. The wine list was amazing.   And, our F&B minimum was eventually adjusted due to the failure at the table.   Following are my recommendations for this spot:  - it's too high volume for a large group. Come in smaller groups (less than 10) and order off the menu instead of getting a tasting menu.  - don't sign a contract because if things don't go your way, they'll be inflexible and refuse to work with you, even a little bit.  - if you do sign a contract then get the private room at least.   I'm giving this spot 5 stars for the food and taking 3 stars away for the awful customer service.", "Date": "2012-07-13", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Amour", "ReviewID": "4bRQuLRDIOlo-YPq7Vsi9A", "Overall": "3", "Content": "I so want to give this place 5 stars. Was highly recommended by a friend. My expectations were high and the tapas did not disappoint. The pan de cristal was sublime. The manchego plate as well as the para negra was out of this world. One dish after the other was well above my expectation. We then decided to order the paella feast. The beet gazpacho that came with it was to die for, while the salad was nothing to rave about. But who cares? Paella was to be the star of the show. So we patiently waited and anticipated how great it would be only because the dishes that came before it were amazingly good. After a 15 minute wait, it finally came. It sadly ruined a meal that was supposed to be a perfect 10. Half of the rice was burnt so bad that it was like eating bitter Rice Krispies. The other half that was not burnt was so salty. The combination of the two just made the dish incredibly inedible. The chicken was also on the dry side. So sad.

However, it was a little different!  Menu looked identical but it wasn't the same. Some of the stuff I had in DC weren't here and the portion was super small. I remember dining in DC and was completely stuffed and our tab weren't that bad. It seemed the prices were way higher here.  The dishes were good but just really puny for the price. Our server was good but she kept recommending things that were astronomical in price and she got the manipulation down in getting you to believe you had no other choice or that was the right choice.  One of the most disappointing item she recommended was the hand carved jamon iberico. It came as dried puny sliced up ham at $35. It was so not worth it. I had the jamon on the bread before with crushed tomatoes in DC, it was so much cheaper and better. It felt like a snow job in this dessert heat. What a rip.   Also, we wanted the seafood paella and our server kept saying that wasn't available until an hour later and the one available was the most expensive one $38 which we sadly ordered because we were starving!!!   However, the croquettas, the spring vegetables with duck egg, chorizo wrapped in potato, boneless wings, and the sliders were delicious.   Still, I can't give it lower than four stars as I'm truly a fan. I was just disappointed that I brought some people to dine here and we left kinda hungry and the tab was over $500 for sharable food people had no more than a bite of each.

Very open and spare.  Place is echo-y and noisy, which bothered me.  Service was pretty nice (when we got it), but somewhat spotty.  Our waitperson was nice and attentive most of the time.. but we had one long gap when we needed a lobster cracker.  Prices:  Friends treated us, which was so special, and we had a great time.  But had I been paying I would have been horrified at what I think are expensive prices for very small (but artfully done) portions.  Tapas:   Teeny, small and verrrry expensive.  But delicious. Had an egg with caviar, some excellent Gazpacho (I normally do not like gazpacho or cold soups, but this was soooooo good).  The presentation of the tapas is excellent, but I just find it silly that they are so tiny, especially for the price.  Paella of the night was Valencia.  Our friends who were treating opted instead to order a custom Paella (serves 6 and there were 5 of us) with lobster and calamari.  I think it cost $120.  It was outstanding.  Rice cooked just right, lobster fabulous.  It was also fun to stand near the Paella cooking station and watch them work their magic over open fires.  Paella took 30 minutes, but worth it.     Drinks:   Did NOT like the red wine Sangria... too sweet and cloying.  Asked waitperson to recommend a Spanish red wine...  She brought me a glass of Vega Escal.  Excellent!  Smooth, full bodied, fruity, just right for the meal.    Desserts wonderful too, but again small and very expsensive.  About the time we were chowing down on our chocolate flan, the place suddenly got jam crowded about 10:30pm.   It go soooo noisy, I was glad we were almost done.

They are also located towards the back of the Cosmopolitan (on the third floor I believe), so expect a LOT of walking to get there. My friends love tapas and wanted to try Jose Andres' Jaleo for our fancy dinner while in Las Vegas. We made reservations for a party of 4, but ran about 15-20 minutes late. Although we called ahead to let them know, they gave away our table, which I could understand. However, once we arrived, they told us we were next on the list, but it took at least 30 minutes before we were seated. Luckily, we were able to tell our server that we needed to get out of there by a certain time, so she was able to rush our dishes. We ordered:  -Pan De Cristal Con Tomate Fresco (Half Loaf of Toasted Bread Brushed w/Fresh Tomato, $12, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jaleo-las-vegas-3?select=xRBBLam0AYhfMFYtZlFMmA#xRBBLam0AYhfMFYtZlFMmA): Just ok. After reading the description of this dish, which claims that it is   uniquely crispy and ethereal bread , I had high expectations. However, this dish was really disappointing. The bread was ok, but too crunchy for my liking, and I didn't think there was anything special about the tomato on it. Skip!  -Jamón Ibérico De Bellota Fermín (Hand-Carved, Cured Ham From the Legendary Acorn-Fed, Black-Footed Ibérico Pigs of Spain, $35/oz, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jaleo-las-vegas-3?select=xRBBLam0AYhfMFYtZlFMmA#IrrNUw_TOBiFdiZW3HK5lQ): Just ok. Although this jamón is supposed to be from the famed Ibérico pigs, I didn't think it was as good as some of the jamón I had in Spain. I wouldn't get this again. -Vieiras Con Salsa De Romesco (Seared Scallops w/Romesco Sauce, $18, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jaleo-las-vegas-3?select=xRBBLam0AYhfMFYtZlFMmA#IyEZzs57dp9C0AVLVY8IcQ): Pretty good. The scallops were cooked well, and I liked the romesco sauce.  -Ensalada De Bogavante Con Cítricos Y Escarola (Maine Lobster Salad w/Citrus, Frisée, $18, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jaleo-las-vegas-3?select=xRBBLam0AYhfMFYtZlFMmA#lT7OTErDIrISaHyyi6m31g): Good, but nothing special. The lobster was cooked very well, but I wouldn't get this again. -Arroz de pato 'Jean Luis Palladin' (Rice w/Duck Confit, Duck Breast, Foie Gras Cream, PX Reduction, $25, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jaleo-las-vegas-3?select=xRBBLam0AYhfMFYtZlFMmA#zRC4UuIfh8yaAHmdFiFoBg): Super salty. The duck breast was seared perfectly, but this dish was difficult to eat with the salt level. I think I would've really enjoyed it if it hadn't been oversalted. -Gambas Al Ajillo (The Very, Very Famous Tapa of Shrimp Sautéed w/Garlic, $16, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jaleo-las-vegas-3?select=xRBBLam0AYhfMFYtZlFMmA#BmzG-8nYewNsvHMUqHmvBg): The shrimp were just ok, but I liked the sauce, and dipping the bread in the sauce. However, I don't think I would order this dish again. -Rossejat Negra con Cigala (Fried Pasta, Squid Ink, Freshwater Prawns, $27): The flavors of this dish were really good, and unique, but again, overly salty. I liked the sweetness the squid ink lent to the fried pasta. I would recommend ordering this dish, but asking them to go lightly on the salt.  Overall, the dishes I had here weren't so great that I would choose to come back over dining at another nice restaurant in Las Vegas since there are so many choices. Also, the chefs here need to go easy on the salt.

This is Las Vegas, after all, and Jaleo has set itself up to be held to a high standard.  Summary of our experience last month to start for those who like to read the ending of a story first is this:     Food:  5 Stars.  Value: 4 Stars.   Ambiance Main Dining room: 4 Stars.   Ambiance Secondary (The Bull) Dining Room:  2 stars.  Service: 2 Stars.     It was AOK but not so  Yay  as a total package experience that we're eager to return.  Are we glad we went once?  Yes.   FOOD & LIBATIONS:  These were the best part of our experience.  We're fans of tapas in general and chef Jose Andres' approach in particular.  We had high expectations for the food and we were not disappointed.  Creative menu, perfect execution by the kitchen with sophisticated and subtle flavors for each of our five (including dessert) choices.    The savories we enjoyed were:  1) potato croquettes (not to be missed), 2) salad with cipollini onions - blue cheese - clementines (delicious), 3) monkfish in parsley oil (intriguingly good) and  4) saute of mixed wild mushrooms and Spanish sausage (heavy on the mushrooms so just right for us).   We chose a dessert special that was a wonderful combination of grapefruit sorbet and ice cream - top notch.   Our beverage choice was house made Sangria. Don't scoff - we're normally not fans of Sangria either, but this was  good and a perfect complement to the food, not to mention most affordable. If don't try the Sangria we think you'll be missing out.  Portions were perfect - we could not have eaten any more but we would not have wanted any less.   VALUE: A nice surprise about Jaleo for us was how affordable it was, by Las Vegas standards at least.  Our total meal for two before tip was just under $80.   SERVICE:  Here the disappointment sets in - big time.  When we finally (you see where this is headed) placed our order, and asked to have the dishes delivered in a specific order, which we were assured would be no problem, our server said something about like this.   You've ordered unusually well for first time guests at Jaleo.  That's probably because you needed to wait on us for such a long time to take your order that you were able to really study our menu.   TA-DUM  She may have thought that was funny; we weren't so sure. Because it is true that after being seated and offered water by the server's assistant (more on that in a minute) we waited better than 15 minutes before we saw a server at our table, in spite of two walking by us several times.  We finally had to flag an assistant down to ask to have someone wait on us.  And it's not as if we were tucked in a corner...being seated on the banquette under The Bull and all.  Then the food items were served out of order.  Which suggests inattention to coordination with the kitchen. Everyone can have a bad night.  Maybe the poor service quality here is not the norm, but it was particularly surprising given it was not quite 7p and the restaurant wasn't even half full.  One word of caution about an item that can run up your tab. When you're seated the server's assistant will ask if you would like water. Yes? Then you'll be asked if you'd prefer sparkling or flat. If you think flat means no charge, you'll be unpleasantly surprised when the bill arrives. If you want water without charge you'll need to specify, you will not be asked,  tap  water. We weren't the only table to feel  had  by that procedure. Fortunately we caught it in advance - the folks next to  us had the unhappy experience of learning the charge applied for water when they got their bill.  Were I making the management decisions here, for purposes of customer good will I'd make sure the fee for flat water was explained at the time the orders were taken.   It's a little thing - but it is a thing.  AMBIANCE:  The main dining room is where the open kitchen and bar are, and where the action is.  Unfortunately, if you want to sit at a table in this section you'll need to navigate high bar height seating.  (Although if you want to sit AT the bar, they do provide a couple of spaces of standard height seating.)  If you want a table with standard dining height seating, the secondary dining room it is.  More sedate and actually sort of absent decor, we would have elected the main dining area but for the high seating at tables.  I'm not sure that it is with high stool dining tables - they don't work great for smaller children, shorter adults, some older adults and in general women in heels and skirts trying to maintain decorum for a business discussion.  Standard height tables work for everyone.

Plus being a Top Chef fan, I am always keen to try some of the guest judges cuisine.  First of all, I want to preface this. I do not doubt that Mr. Andres has incredible skill. I think that some of the things we had took a lot of technique to perfect (ie, Iberico ham croquettes and Cod empanadas). But technical skill does not make a great meal because in the end (for me)...it is all about flavour.  So we started off with some roasted peppers, eggplant and sweet onion which was not what we were expecting. If you check out the pics - the eggplant looked like tapeworms swimming in olive oil. Visual appeal rates a zero. Luckily, it tasted okay albeit pedestrian given the caliber of this establishment.  I think the thing that makes this place shine is their ability to take make fried food with a molten center. Both the Iberico ham croquettes and cod empanadas were surprisingly lovely and crisp on the outside without succuming to the liquid in the middle. There were problems with the these dishes though. The flavour of the Iberico ham was lost in the enveloping bechamel sauce. The cod empanadas were good but were overly fishy for my hubby's tastes (kind of like a strong mackeral - I'll admit, I did enjoy this but would likely not order this again).  Iberico ham (oh, that creamy nutty luscious goodness that literally melts in your mouth) was very small portion considering the cost. Doesn't come with bread either which made it difficult to truly enjoy due to the inherent salinity of the meat. It definitely needed something else to justify the cost of this dish.  The foie gras cannelloni was a huge disappointment mostly because of the preparation of the foie gras filling. The texture was grainy while the flavour of goose liver was completely absent from the dish. As a matter of fact, the filling had an unpleasant sourness to it that even overwhelmed the lovely unctiousness of the liberally combined shaved truffle and truffle oil. As they say, no bueno.  By far the best dish of the night - the veal cheek with morel mushrooms. Utterly delicious, the judicious scent of cinnamon gave a mild hint of spice in this earthy dish. The textures of the meat was marvelous - like the best succulent short rib you've ever had.   Hazelnut cake was surprising lacking in hazelnuts other than as a candied garnish. For a Nutella lover like me, it's like a bait and switch and I was oh-so-sad. A chocolate mousse over sponge was okay but nothing you couldn't get elsewhere for significantly less. Toying with my affections that way is a cruel joke, my friends. A cruel joke indeed.  Like all tapas places, the portion sizes were small and definitely overpriced. I would probably go back again for the veal cheek alone (yes, it is that good and is also the sole reason this place rates a 3) but would likely order other things off the menu.", "Date": "2011-04-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jerry", "ReviewID": "NxqBSF0WgqmKCkFAMAB0NA", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Oh man we had such high hopes for this place.

I've been meaning to try it for awhile since I love Jose Andres' restaurants. Easily got a reservation through Opentable.  Great service & lively, modern & vibrant setting. Everything is red and black. The menu is pretty overwhelming as with most tapas (and esp. Andres') restaurants. We were advised to order 3 dishes per person, but I'm glad I took out a few. We were so full by the end of it all. This is NOT because of portion sizes - those are quite small and quite expensive. It was because of the heaviness & richness of everything. All of the dishes had beautiful & quirky presentations, so I'm sure that added to the price tag.    First - I ordered the cocktail that was made with cucumber water, berry purée, vodka, & wine, and it was so refreshing and delicious. Didn't taste like there was alcohol in it, though it did taste like the best spa water I've ever had.  All of the dishes that we ordered were great except the patatas bravas.   Chicken croquettes - 5 stars. They were served in a Camper brand shoe (my favorite shoe brand - have you tried them? Their leather is so amazingly soft and their designs are out there). The presentation was odd, and I'm not sure about the relevance, but I was happy to see Campers. The clean freak in me was hoping the shoes were clean. lol. The croquettes were so creamy, rich, crispy but not greasy, and had nice chunks of chicken inside. I would have eaten all of them if I didn't feel guilty about the fried aspect.  Vegetable paella - 5 stars. I can't believe I'm giving a vegetable dish 5 stars. I was initially disappointed that the only paella they had during our time there was a vegetable one. However, it was a damn fine vegetable paella. The flavor was strong and vibrant. The risotto was cooked perfectly! There were tons of vegetables in there (and not the cheap nasty kinds) - asparagus, baby radishes, cauliflower... There was a bit too much of a veg to rice ratio though, but it all tasted great.  Bacon-wrapped dates - 3.5 stars. Good but greasy. They were breaded which was unusual, but I liked that about them. I'm just not normally a fan of bacon-wrapped dates in general.  Endive with goat cheese, oranges, & almonds - 5 stars. I can't believe this. 2 5-star ratings for 2 vegetarian dishes. There's something wrong with me. This may have been my favorite dish of the night. It was so bright and sooooo flavorful and refreshing. The creaminess of the whipped goat cheese, the sweet citrus from the orange slices and the crunch and slight bitterness from the endive - wow what simplicity and what a marriage of flavors. It was also a gorgeous dish.  Mini fried shrimp skewers 3.5 to 4 stars - these were some baaaaby shrimp. Loved the taste and the simplicity. They were so skinny and shrimpy shrimp though. Good thing they had almost 10 pieces in the basket.  Garlic Shrimp - 3 stars - this was more tomatoey than I'm used to seeing with this dish. The shrimp weren't impressive and the dish was meh overall.  Patatas Bravas - 1 star. Oh what a disappointing dish. Don't expect your usual fried potato cubes with aioli and chili sauce. These were a mess of super thin fried potato chips dusted with so much smoked paprika that you'd better not inhale too strongly. You'd surely start choking. There was some light aioli on top. All of the toppings blanketed the top layer of crisps, so you could barely eat the top ones and then the bottom ones didn't have anything. Not even salt. We left most of that bowl untouched.  Skirt steak - 4 stars - perfectly cooked. Juicy. Seasoned well. Smoky. Simple and good.  Flan - 2.5 stars. It had a nice citrus taste, but the texture was soft like panna cotta. I'm not a fan of panna cotta.   Apple Charlotte dessert 4.5 stars - warm, crispy bread exterior. Sweet & cinnamony apple interior. Nice ice cream on the side. So good.  Overall, the portions are small, the prices are high, the food is mostly darn good. It was by far the busiest restaurant in that corridor at the Cosmopolitan. I can see why.

I know what happens in Vegas is supposed to stay in Vegas, but... tell that to the 5 lbs I gained in 4 days. The new pounds certainly didn't stay in Vegas.  We feasted on: 1) squid ink pasta (more like vermicelli) with lobsters. The lobster was tasty, but it's the squid ink pasta that stole the show. I would've licked the pan clean if I hadn't been in public.  2) panne con tomate with anchovies. You don't like anchovies, you say? Are you scrinching your nose at the thought of anchovies? These are not the anchovies that come in a can. These are fresh, slightly salty, and give a nice depth of flavor to the traditional tomato toast.  3) Salad: fennel, walnuts, apple, and manchego cheese. A great start to our dinner. Would be good between the plates too, b/c it was kind of a palate cleanser.   4) cheese plate: we got 1 creamy and 2 hard cheeses. I don't remember the names, but the creamy served with the fig raisin toast was by far the best one. you have to eat these cheeses with the paired garnish.  5) Paella: GET SOME. You don't come to a place with the only fire paella pit stand in the US and not get the paella. This is what you smell when you walk by this restaurant and why you came. You should come with a larger group so you can order a few paellas. Ours was a mushroom, roasted suckling pig paella. Mushrooms and pork were great, but again, I just wanted to eat the tender yet crunchy rice.  6) Dessert: My taste buds were done by this point; they had been overwhelmed by the above offerings. Or maybe the flan, served with creme fraiche and lemon sorbet, was too delicate to stand out after all the rich flavors that came before.

The food that came out was definitely interesting and generally tasty, and of a decent variety. But, being tapas, there was about one bite of everything for each person. In the end we got a good number of different tapas (needing about 2 or 3 of each to feed our table of 8). I really liked the bacon-wrapped dates, the (lamb?) ribs, and this one dish with some kind of spread with an underdone hard-boiled egg that you put on bread. I was less impressed with the paella, the shrimp, and the bruschetta-like dishes. The restaurant also claims it has the world's best gin and tonic...and while it was tasty and really well-done, I wasn't crazy enough about it to want a second one.  All in all, the food was fine, but the high price tag just didn't seem to correspond to how much I enjoyed the food.

For some reason the temperature at the restaurant is set to below freezing, which makes being there really uncomfortable.  I felt like grabbing the manager and saying: look, this is the Cosmopolitan, do you not see all these poor women sitting here half naked and shivering?  You need to shut the bloody AC off!  They have a foosball table outside which doubles up as a dining table for six.  It is a super fun idea and a super impractical one at the same time.  The seats are shaped like saddles so there is no back support- there is in fact very little bottom support - you kind of hover in mid air half the time trying not to fall off completely - much like being on a real saddle I suppose!  Best of all, the poles in the table provide a great opportunity to file a lawsuit against the establishment since you can easily stab and seriously damage the person sitting across from you if you're not careful.

Eating at a José Andres restaurant can be quite a treat because he is often credited for increasing the awareness and appreciation for Spanish cuisine in America. I was spending NYE with the family and seeing that they loved the tapas at Aria's Julian Serrano, this would be similar to what they had there.   VENUE: Located in the 2nd floor  restaurant row  inside the Cosmopolitan. They try to take advantage of their real estate by packing as many people as they can inside the restaurant - not much space for diners in the tables and little table space to spread out a tapas spread. Even é has more space for fellow diners! Like many other communal dining spaces the restaurant noise level is loud throughout.   SERVICE: We had good service when it was time for place orders but probably in an intentional way to space out between plates the lighter tapas get served more quickly than the heavier tapas. It's at least a 45 minute wait for paella.  TAPAS - Crystal Bread with Fresh Tomato ($12). Think of a bruschetta using a dough with lots of air pockets inside. The olive oil and fresh tomato whet my appetite for the upcoming dishes. One of their most popular tapas.  - Cono de atun ($5/cone). All of us got the salmon cone. It is very similar to a salmon tartare cone I had at TFL except using salmon roe eggs. Entire family devoured our cones in two bites. We refrained from ordering another round because we didn't want to get too full just on cones.  - Piquillo peppers stuffed with Caña de Cabra goat cheese ($10). Delicious as the description states. The cheese was slightly salty to flavor the peppers.  - Patatas Bravas ($10). They were generous with the thick fingerling potatoes. Potatoes were on the tough side. Their interpretation of brava sauce tastes like a lot of other Spanish restaurants. My family liked Julian Serrano's interpretation more as their potatoes are more crispy.  - Gambas al ajillo (Garlic Shrimp, $16). One of their most popular tapas, the shrimps are heavily soaked in olive oil with a chili pepper added. Shrimps were big and full of garlic and olive oil. A small baguette was provided to soak the extra olive oil.   - Rack of lamb with parsley oil ($22). Thick rack of lamb portions that were moist due to the parsley oil.  Meat was less lean than other rack of lamb dishes.  -Chuleta asada ($72). Grass-fed bone-in ribeye. Cooked medium rare and brushed with sea salt and rosemary. Meat-to-fat portion was equal. Flavorful and tender but you can get better quality meat at steakhouses for the price. I LOVE the olive oil potato puree as its one of the best interpretations of mash potatoes I've tried - so creamy and fluffy.  - Shrimp and Calamari Paella ($28/person, 2 person minimum) Two paellas are made daily from rotating pans cooked over a wood fire. When a paella is finished cooking, sounds of a bell ringing and people shouting  PAELLA!  can be heard all over the restaurant (except for the é area). Entire paella pots for six guests can be made to order. Most paella dishes end up actually being disappointing - the rice was very salty and somewhat hard and it cooled off rather quickly. Shrimps were big but were overcooked.  - Homemade flan with espuma (foam) Catalan creme ($12). Based on Jose's mother's recipe Marisa, it is a custard-forward flan using a foamed Catalan creme and oranges. The orange sorbet and sliced oranges provide a sharp contrast and complement the rich and creamy custard.  My family still likes Julian Serrano but I'll be a rebel and call Jaleo my preferred tapas place in Vegas. PS: Earlier that year I also got to try their more exclusive experience, located at the back of Jaleo (http://www.yelp.com/biz/%C3%A9-by-jos%C3%A9-andr%C3%A9s-las-vegas-3?hrid=9P1EljDM_e-bgzCzxI0haQ).

The first section has gazpacho and various salads/veggies.  The second section has fried items including Patatas Bravas and croquetas.  The third section has shrimp, chicken, chorizo, and beef selections.  You can add one of the featured paellas of the day for $7.  For my three items, I chose: - Manzana con Hinojo y Queso Manchego (sliced apple and fennel salad with Manchego cheese, walnuts, and sherry dressing).  I've had this kind of salad at another tapas restaurant and I liked it here just as much as the other place.  The combo of apple and cheese is refreshing and light. - Croquetas de Pollo (traditional chicken fritters).  This dish comes out in a hiking shoe, Chef Jose Andres' take on fast food.  Super fun and the croquetas were delectable.  I think there were four in the shoe, but I could have eaten more so maybe bring me a pair of shoes next time. - Mini Pepito de Iberico (Spanish mini burger made from Iberico pigs and Iberico bacon.)  The menu states that these pigs are legendary, black-footed, and acorn-fed, but all I know is that it was one tasty little slider.  Our party of four also shared an order of the veggie paella and ended with the flan, which I would think are two dishes you should eat in a Spanish restaurant, verdad?  Happy we ordered them to complement our meals and so were our stomachs. We arrived at noon on Saturday with reservations, however, the restaurant was empty since it had just opened.  A nice, open space, you can see staff making the paella in large pans.  Our service was excellent throughout and the tapas came out at a nice pace.

Lynn & I went with her brother, who -- despite living in Vegas -- has never eaten here.  At some point, however, he's learned to turn the ordering over to his big sister and her husband (that would be me), and so off we went . . .   We were told that the lobster paella would be about 40-45 minutes, so of course we ordered that immediately . . . and it was the first dish to arrive at our table.  Good news:  it arrived within 10 minutes.  Bad news:  it arrived within 10 minutes.  Let me explain:    I thought I had ordered an array of tapas, salads, etc. and it would culminate with the paella.  Having it arrive first threw the progression of dishes I had in my head out the proverbial window, but the paella was so damned good, who cares???    Next arrived the plate of green olives stuffed with anchovy and piquillo peppers, and paired with Ferrán Adrià  olives  -- little  balloons  of liquid (Kalamata?) olives that burst in the mouth, filling you with that wonderful olive deliciousness.  Amazing!  And for someone who deeply regrets never dining at El Bulli, this was a REAL treat!  Served with that was the Selección de embutidos -- a selection of cured meats (Jamón Ibérico de bellota Fermin, Jamón Ibérico Fermin, Jamón Serrano Fermin, Lomo Ibérico de bellota Fermin, and house-made Chorizo Palacios) paired with their Pan con Tomate.  Delicious, flavorful, and indeed somewhat magical.  Next to arrive was the Manzana con hinojo y queso Manchego (a sliced apple and fennel salad with Manchego cheese, walnuts and Sherry dressing) that was crisp, light, refreshing, and very tasty.    Our waitperson, Samantha, was knowledgeable and helpful, enthusiastic without being artificial in any way.  Based upon her recommendation ( I never eat veal, but this is my favorite thing on the menu! ), we ordered the Fricandó de carilleras de ternera y puré de patatas al aceite de olive (Veal cheeks and morels with olive oil potato purée).  OMG, she was right!  Rich, flavorful, melt-in-your-mouth lusciousness that was so sensual, so . . .,  so close to being over-the-top that, were it any closer, it would be illegal!  Recovering from this silky dish of richness, we moved on to the deceivingly simple sounding Trigueros con romesco (Grilled asparagus with romesco sauce), pencil-thin -- NO, eyebrow pencil-thin asparagus grilled to perfection with romesco that we could have eaten all night long.  Major yums!  Finally, we had Rape a la Donostiarra (Monkfish with garlic, Sherry and parsley oil).  Again, deceptively simple in name, but don't let that stop you.  Normally, I'm one of those people who don't  get  monkfish (aka  the poor man's lobster ).  It's never seemed like lobster to me, and most of the times when I've had monkfish in the past, it's been overcooked and rather bland.  But this . . . THIS was OUTSTANDING!  Truly, the best monkfish I've ever had, and a dish I already want to have again!  Thinly sliced pieces of monkfish delicately poached (sous vide?) with just a hint of garlic and sherry, and a drizzle of parsley oil . . . this was THE dish-of-the-night, and the perfect dish to end our meal on!  Well, OK, with had José Andres' grandmother's flan.  This, too, was the best flan I've ever had in my life!  They have a great selection of Spanish wines, too.  (They have wines from elsewhere, but to be honest, I didn't look.)

In fact there were a couple things that I did really like, but overall, this place missed the mark for me.    We started with the pan con tomate, which was very good.  The bread was very tasty, as was the fresh tomato grated on top, then finished with a delicious olive oil.    Next, we ordered the potatas bravas.  This dish was a complete fail.  Instead of the classic fried or boiled potatoes covered in a spicy pimenton sauce, this dish is a a bowl of potato chips that was emptied into a bowl and then two cold sauces squirted over the top.  The first sauce was a tomato based sauce with some paprika flavor, but seemed a little off.  The second sauce was a mayo/garlic aioli.  This dish was terrible.  Next, came the chicken croquetas.  These were pretty tasty, they had a nice creamy texture and good flavor.  They oddly came served in a shoe.  Then we ordered the Chistorra envuelta en patata frita.  This dish was little pieces of mildly spicy chorizo that was wrapped in a potato chip.  The chorizo was tasty, but being wrapped in the potato chip fell flat for me and I wasnt really impressed, not a bad dish though.  Next was the Chorizo casero con puré de patatas al aceite de oliva.  This dish was another that was pretty tasty and largely because of the chorizo.  The potato puree that it was served on was also tasty and had a nice creamy texture.  Where this dish turned a little south was in the cidre sauce, which did not taste much like cidre and instead more like Worcestershire.  The other element that was a little too much was the amount of large pieces of sea salt sprinkled on the dish.  This dish has promise, I just thought the execution was off.  Finally, we ordered the Mini pepito de ibérico and this was the highlight of the meal.  This is a burger slider made with iberico pork, topped with iberico bacon, a roasted pepper and a delicious aioli type sauce.  This little two bite slider was great and I should have made a meal out of just these.  However, at eight dollar a piece, that is an expensive two bites.  I am glad we ordered these last because they were the best item we had.  Overall, I think this place is using very good ingredients and doing some cool things with the traditional tapas, I just was not a fan of their interpretation of the things that I tried.  Also, this place is very expensive.  For the above mentioned tapas and one glass of sangria (which was very tasty), the bill was just over $100.  The ingredients are quality, but this cost for tapas is just crazy, no doubt because of being located on the strip and carrying a famous chef's name.

Jaleo went above and beyond to make sure we were allllll happy with our experience there.   For a large group we had to go through a reservation line, and it was so nice to correspond back and forth on email! Jaleo is EXTREMELY accommodating for large groups. They let you fully customize the menu, and they even printed our event name at the top! We had a vegetarian in our group, and the day of the dinner, they really took care of her and gave her unique dishes to accommodate her diet.   I really loved our experience at Jaleo. It was very well worth the money we spent. If we come again as a large party, I would definitely want to eat there again.  Below is our menu and my opinions on each dish. The full array of dishes cost us $$105pp, and that includes tax and tip.  **Seleccion de jamones Fermin pro Jose -- the ham selection was very good! the fatty one they brought out was extremely buttery and tasty.  It came with a side of tomato bread (pan con tomate).   **Aceitunas rellenas y acietunas 'Ferran Adria' - not my favorite dish.  the liquid olives were weird and CRAZY SALTY!  **La Serena con membrillo - strong cheese in a little cone w/ quince paste.  if you are not a fan of blue cheese or goat cheese, you probably wouldn't like this one. The aroma of the cheese is very pungent, but I thought the quince paste balanced it out.  _____________  **Salmon crudo con vinagreta de anchoas - The salmon was very fresh, and the dish was served like a tartare.  The slices of salmon were very thin, with the lemon anchovy oil drizzled all around.  Kudos from all around the table for this dish.  **Gambas al ajillo - There is a reason why this shrimp is 'VERY FAMOUS'.  The sauce is incredible, and the shrimp is perfectly cooked.  My friend wanted a straw to slurp up the leftover sauce haha  **Huevo frito con caviar - egg with egg.  DELICIOUS! MY FAVORITE OF THE NIGHT.  It was so flavorful. The egg was poached perfectly with some runniness on the inside, and the caviar on top gave it just the right amount of saltiness.  yumm!!!!!  **Escalivada catalana - roasted red peppers and eggplant.  good palate cleanser.  the smokiness of fire roasting the veggies was perfect.  _____________  Manzana con hinojo y queso Manchego - LOVE Manchego cheese.  This salad was extremely refreshing, and the fennel bulb was not too licorice-y.  We ate this slowly so that we could pick at it the rest of the dinner.  Butifarra casera esparracada - pork sausage stew - it was good, but not very memorable.  Fricando de carilleras de ternera y pure de patatas al aceite de oliva - the veal cheeks were so tender. This dish would have been perfect, and I probably would rave about it more if it had come earlier in the meal.  We were getting full by this point!  _____________  **Setas al ajillo con la serena - sauteed wild mushrooms - had to get some more vegetables in there somehow :) not bad  **Carne asada con piquillos 'Julian de Lodosa' - It is very easy to overcook this cut of steak,but our steak came out a perfect medium.  Tender, juicy, yummy :)  **Arroz a banda con bogvante - lobster paella.  again, if this came out earlier I would be raving about it.  sooooo stuffed!  ___________  DESSERT! **Flan - YUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMMY -my favorite **Chocolate hazelnut mousse cake - very rich, and very good, but i could only have 1 bite. **Olive oil ice cream wtih grapefruit - surprisingly good!

The place was jam-packed, I LOVE Tapas (having lived in Spain for a short time) and the hostess was absolutely AWESOME and managed to get us a private room for my sister's 21st birthday. I have to be honest: the meal turned out to be a pretty big disappointment. I probably wouldn't recommend this to anyone with limited time in Vegas, although I have to say, I'd probably go back and try different menu items. Most restaurants deserve a second chance.  SERVICE: This was one of the main reasons I didn't end up loving Jaleo. The hostess was GREAT - she worked some magic and got us a private room (that doesn't take reservations) and she checked in while we were waiting to provide us updates on timing. When we sat down, we had two servers assigned to our room. The main waitress was nice, but steamrolled our decision-making process. Having lived in Spain, I had some definite opinions on what we should order and I could hardly get a word in edgewise. She also failed to get drink orders from everyone and when I tried to speak up to order, she talked right over me. Finally, another member of my group tapped her on the arm to let her know she hadn't gotten a drink order from me. While I knew what the dishes were like, the rest of my group wasn't acquainted with many of the menu items. When asked for what she'd recommend, the waitress blew through several items so quickly that my friends couldn't even keep up to locate them on the menu. It didn't help that she used the Spanish names instead of describing what they were in English. Her initial service left a bad taste in my mouth for the rest of the meal.  FOOD: One thing about Jaleo - this is one authentic tapas menu. I was REALLY impressed. It's a huge menu and there are so many things on it that most Americanized tapas joints wouldn't include. The gazpacho was a HUGE hit at our table, although difficult to share because it was served in one dish. The garlic shrimp was pretty good, although a member of our table got one of those awkward bad shrimp - something I don't think can be avoided. The peppers stuffed with goat cheese (my selection) turned out to be a hit despite no one else seeming interested in it from the beginning. Definitely order that if you go. I'd pass on either of the croquettes (but I never liked them in Spain either, so that may just be a  me  thing). They were served in a Camper tennis shoe, which was SUPER cute. We loved that - although the waitress had zero explanation for it. Lame. One thing I would definitely NOT order again was the beef paella. It was some of the worst meat in the paella that I've ever had - another member of our group couldn't eat meat for the next two days because she was so grossed out. Plus, it was SO expensive! Be sure to check the price on paella before you order...and I'd go with more tapas instead. Or, maybe try the seafood paella.  DRINKS: One regret from our group - we wish we had ordered a carafe of sangria. Instead, some of us had wine and some had cocktails. My Whiskey de Verano was AWESOME and I'd recommend it to others. Good drink options. No problems here.  ATMOSPHERE: The restaurant, which is totally open on one side is pretty upbeat and busy. It was PACKED on a Thursday at 9:30. But, like I said - we had the  private room. It was AWESOME. It had glass doors, so the noise was kept out (and ours was kept in). My friends who were facing the doors, though, said waiters and waitresses kept staring at us through the doors, which was a little awkward. Oh well. Deal with it - the room was great. It even had a lazy susan on the table to help share tapas.  OVERALL: Like I said, I'd go back here again to give the authentic Spanish menu another try. But, I wouldn't go for a special occasion or with a HUGE group. I'd order the sangria and I'd go with lower expectations.

If you're looking for a tapas restaurant and you're stuck on the Strip, this place might do. If not, you might look elsewhere.  One of the many definitions of  jaleo  is  the act of making a noisy disturbance,  and that's certainly the case here. This venue is LOUD. Like, you can let out a string of cuss words at the top of your lungs, and no one will even notice. (Not that my husband did that or anything ...)  That said, the service was good and the white sangria was excellent. (We tried both the red and white, and the white won out.) And the Restaurant Week menu offered nine courses, which I will rank from best to worst (not in the order we were served):  1. Pepito de Ibérico (beef slider with Ibérico bacon, caramelized onions, piquillo pepper, and aioli)  2. Melon con Jamon Serrano (cantaloupe with Serrano ham) 3. Endibias con queso de cabra ya naranjas (endive stuffed with goat cheese, oranges, and almonds)  4. Ajo blanco malagueño (cold almond soup with crab, grapes, raisins, and almonds)  5.

Calamares a la Romana (fried calamari with garlic aioli)  In a nutshell, the sliders were fantastic; the paella (undercooked) and the calamari (ugh!) were forgettable; and everything else was fair to middling. Overall, everything was underseasoned--a little salt would have gone a long way.  As I said, if you really want some tapas, you can probably find something on the menu to satisfy you. But I miss the days when we could pop into Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba at the Fashion Show Mall and have some half-priced sangria and tasty meatballs.

We went with a 2 top that was close to the open fireplace where they roast a whole pig every Sunday. The service here is excellent, you'll have a primary waiter but about 3 different people bringing you food that can take your order or answer any questions you have. The entire staff was great with giving reccomendations, either that or every dish here is great. I suggest ordering your items one or two at a time because they all came out in about 5 or so minutes. Here is a summary of what we had:  Sangria - Really good sangria, not too sweet, tastes just strong enough  Pan Con Tomate with Jamon Serrano - 3 great pieces of bread topped with a tomato salsa and some of the finest Serrano ham around  Croquetas de Pollo... Served in a shoe! - They said it was one of their signature dishes. It is a tater tot like thing with great shredded chicken in a sauce on the inside. All this and it is served in a shoe  Gazpacho de Remolacha Con Queso de Cabra y Naranjas - Hands down the coolest looking dish. In the gazpacho (chilled vegetable soup) was oranges, raspberries, and goat cheese. The mix was surprising refreshing  Gambas al Ajillo - Garlic shrimp, they said it was another one of their signature dishes  Fricando de Carilleras de Ternera y Pure de Patatas al Aceite de Oliva (veal cheeks) - If I didn't know that they were the cheeks I would've just thought it was the tenderest veal ever. It came with some amazing olive oil mashed potato's  Canelones Tradicionales de Cerdo y Higado de Pato con Salsa Bechamel - shredded pork and foie gras inside a pasta canoli shell topped with a bechamel sauce (similar to alfredo sauce)  Flan al Estilo Tradicional de Mama Marisa con Espuma de Crema Catalana - Best flan ever. It came with some really good sorbet, some whipped vanilla ice cream which was amazing different, and everything was topped with some kind of crunchy praline like stuff", "Date": "2012-02-17", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Adam", "ReviewID": "RxRSSTKhpSiEGN_POIwKEw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Wandering through the culinary halls of the Cosmopolitan can be a daunting task.  There is no shortage of wonderful restaurant from which to choose, and at some point you just have to pick one.  Last night, we decided to pick two.    My wife and I decided that it was time to go experience Jose Andres, Vegas style.  Being from the DC area we had been exposed to his Epicurean talents but were not sure what to expect from this Jaleo or China Poblano.  With Jose it is best to expect the unexpected at all times.  From the seating area directly in front of Jaleo we surveyed the crowd inside.  This place has an electric feel from hallway.  There are several different styles of tables including a foosball table conversion that seems a bit distracting.  The rest of the tables are diverse in style, and draw one's eye around the room.  In the center of the restaurant there is a small open-fire kitchen where they prepare the paella.  We sampled the lobster paella and it was phenomenal.  We also ordered an array of small plates and had an absolute blast.  The winner for me from Jaleo was the gin and tonic oysters that were so fresh and flavorful it made me wonder how they had gotten to the middle of the desert so quickly.  The service was prompt, attentive and friendly.

They don't fill water to the top of the glass, and the glasses are rather average sized for water glasses so that kinda sucks. Wines/drinks are pricey for the 'most part.' Our waiter, while initially attentive, after we placed our order, we did not see him towards the end of our meal.  We would have ordered another bottle of slightly overpriced wine, if we had seen him.  Their loss.   Chicken wings were nothing special.  Bar food chicken wings are on average, better tasting. Seating arrangements are not the most comfortable, as for most of our night, we were seated pretty close to two other couples.  We made friends though, but in the event we had not, it would have been more of a con.  Pros: Great variety of wine. Great food, especially the caviar on organic egg. Had a few 6 dollar glasses of wine (white and red) options.  We opted for a 30 dollar bottle of wine, which was quite good. Modern and energetic.  Quick getting to our seats, friendly host. Some decently priced food options in comparison to other restaurants at the Cosmopolitan/like-restaurants.  While at first glance, it looks like more cons than pros, the great food really made it 4 stars.  Fun experience to try new food and not feel craycray for ordering 6 menu items for 2 people.

Tasted almost like a chicken pot pie, but in a light breading.   House chorizo wrapped in potato chips.   Octopus served salad style and we loved it so much we had the octopus with potatoes too. One was boiled one was sautéed yet both seemed boiled. Still great.   Oysters with gin and tonic... Yup. No seasoning needed.   The house shrimp tapa, was a must try!!

Prepare to pay between $14 and $30 per small plate, which is expensive for tapas but Vegas in General is expensive. I had a sparkling sangria coupon (woohoo!) so I ordered that. The drink was okay but like some other reviewers mentioned not as good as some of the other drinks I've had at other Jose Andres restaurants. We ordered a chorizo, and a shrimp tapa. Both were pretty good, unfortunately neither were as warm as I felt they should be but the flavor was great. We didn't do the paella which is a big deal here! I think how it works is they switch which paella they make every few minutes and when they switch the chefs ring a big bell and everyone yells  Jaleo!! .

Went to Jaleo on Aug 25/2014 during the Las Vegas Restaurant week (party of 3) and was able to enjoy the following 9 course meal for only $50.14! A great deal all made better by our amazing server Mario L who was super attentive to my wife's food allergies and double checked everything to make sure we were fine. Atmosphere was great, on the louder side but the Spanish guitar playing in the background went perfect with the flavors and aromas of the night.  I have reviewed each menu item briefly below, but the overall experience was amazing, transported us to our various Tapas experiences throughout Spain in Seville, Marbella, Madrid, Barcelona and Ibiza.  FOOD: 1. Aceitunas Rellenas - Olives stuffed with anchovy and piquillo: These where great, very different, I usually don't like anchovies that much but you couldn't even taste them, there was an orange paste on the olives.  2. Melon con Jamon - Serrano Cantaloupe with Serrano ham: This was amazing, thinly shaved melon with freshly cut Serrano toped with olive oil and edible flowers. Perfect!  3. Calamares a la Romana - Fried fresh calamari with garlic alioli: I am not too crazy about friend calamari but these were probably one of the best/freshest ones I have had outside of spain/Portugal/Italy/or anywhere surrounded by sea!  4. Endibias con queso de cabra ya naranjas - Endives, goat cheese, oranges and almonds: Simple and flavorful, they literally pop in your mouth as the crunchiness of the endives meets the sweetness of the orange and the creaminess of the goat cheese.  5. Ajo blanco malagueño - Malaga-style chilled almond soup with crab, grapes, raisins and almonds: This was ridiculously good! 10/10 never tasted anything quite like it, it was the consistency of a more liquid hummus but with a light almond flavor, the resins/grapes and the crab balanced the whole  dish into an exceptional culinary experience that I didn't know was possible by having what is basically a cold soup!!  6. Judias con romesco y Caña de Cabra - Green beans with romesco and Caña de Cabra cheese: Lightly grilled or pan friend French beans with goat cheese, excellent and again, something different from what you normally expect from French beans  7. Pepito de Ibérico - Mini burger with Ibérico bacon, caramelized onion, piquillos and alioli: This was tasty and rich. Loved the smokiness of the Iberico with the juiciness of the beef and the roasted pepper.  8. Paella del día - The best-known dish in Spanish cuisine, made in our open-fire, wood-burning : 10/10! Again, Absurdly good! This was a vegetable Paella and it was hands down one of the best executions of a paellas I have ever  had! The rice, the sauce and the consistency of all the ingredients were perfect. Made me REALLY curious about how good their seafood paellas can be!   9. Sorbetes Caseros Con 'carquinyolis'- House-made sorbet with a traditional Catalan crisp: Redcurrant sorbet, a perfect end to a wonderful meal, had a hint of mint/basil, even though there was no mint or Basil used in it! Which apparently what you get when you have incredibly fresh redcurrants!  This was a 9 courses meal but the ingredients are so fresh and the preparation is so great that we didn't feel full or uncomfortable.  DRINKS: I tasted 2 different Gin and Tonics, the Sangria and a glass of wine.  Growing up in UK and visiting Spain many, many times in my life, I consider myself a bit of a  Gin Tonic  connoisseur (as its called in Spain). In fact I would love to meet Jose Andres over some Gin Tonics and discuss how to perfect this drinks which happens to be my favorite.  Come on guys, you can make it happen!!!  From the Ice (a perfectly clear sphere, which is hard to make and is apparently shipped in from California!) to the choice of Tonic , the herbs and spices and the Gin itself,  both the Jose's and the Citrico Gin Tonics where Great.   Lets put it this way, this isn't your grandma's Gin & Tonic and it's a must try if you visit Jaleo.

She's been to Spain - I didn't even know tapas originated from there - and she said that Jaleo served authentic tapas. Makes me want to go to Spain.  We also ordered sangria which was like fruit punch - I wanted bottomless refills.

The sangria is amazing and the food is delicious, the decor and ambiance really goes well together but that doesn't outweigh the things I was greatly displeased with. To start off with the restaurant doesn't even have it's name on the outside, how is it people are suppose to find the place if it isn't label? Is it suppose to be a secret that only a certain group of people know about? I only found it after walking around the third floor of the Cosmopolitan and using the process of elimination to figure out that particular restaurant must be Jaleo. Once we got our seats, I might was well be eating with the other patrons surrounding me, that's how close, cramp and loud it is!  Our waitress was very pleasant she took the time to explain the menu to us and handed us an iPad to order drinks. So what was the point of the iPad drink menu? Absolutely nothing! Basically it's a 300 dollar drink menu. You're suppose to scroll through the different cocktails, wines, beers...etc and you show your selections to your server which he/she writes down on a pad of paper. It's not like your sending your order electronically to the bar...because that would make too much sense.   So after you waste your time trying to rationalize the use of the iPad drink menu it's time to order the food. Ironically this doesn't involve another iPad. So we ordered six things off the menu, 3 for the each of us.  Now I've been to other tapas restaurants before and when you order a couple of things off a menu the server does their best to try to get as many plates to you as possible so they can get you in and out. Well apparently that's not part of Jaleo's business model. Their model seems to work as let's wait 15 to 20 minutes before each plate comes out. Keep in mind that we had a show to attend across the street at Planet Hollywood at 9pm and I was required to pick up the tickets by 8pm, our reservation was at 6pm. So an hour and half goes by and still we didn't get our 6th plate, apparently the waitress or the kitchen staff totally forgot, so the restaurant manager reassured us that the dish would be out in a few moments. 10 minutes went by and still nothing, keep in mind it was a pasta dish...nothing super complicated! Eventually we got frustrated with the wait time and demanded the check, they of course they didn't charge us for the dish they couldn't get to us in time.  As I was signing my credit card receipt the manager came up to us again and reassured us better service if we were to come back, by that time I handed him my opinion on the  How Are We Doing?  suggestion pad. I pretty much wrote to him how lousy the food service was. Overall, stay away from this place. There are many tapas restaurants in Las Vegas, I still prefer Fire Fly.

Me and my Sig other went here for lunch, excited to try a Jose Andres restaurant.   We started our meal with the signature gin and tonics, which were the best part of the meal. They were infused with different spices, clean tasting, and herbal. Worth the $20 in my opinion. We then ordered a bunch of tapas: fried dates wrapped in bacon, house made chorizo, patatas bravas, and octopus salad, and a Spanish spring roll (rollito).  The breading on the dates obscured the natural caramel flavor of the dates. It also detracted from the usual salty-sweet combo I'm used to with this appetizer. This is the first time I have been served this dish fried, I'm not keen to try it again.   The patatas bravas was so disappointing. They used waxy potatoes instead of a starchy variety, so it never got crispy like the dish should be. The romesco sauce also tasted more like bland ketchup than the rich, tangy, creamy sauce it should be.   The octopus had an off flavor to it --it tasted like old tuna. It was tender but lacking an flavor. It was served with bland boiled potatoes and a dash of smoked paprika. It needed herbs or vinegar to wake it up.   The spring roll was filled with potatoes and chorizo which needed seasoning--not enough chorizo in the filling to compensate for the under salted potatoes. The Apple mustard that it was served with was amazing: sweet and spicy. I wish I could have had it with every dish--it would have considerably improved their flavors.  The best dish was the housemade chorizo. It was seared with cider which gave it an addictive sweet, salty and fatty flavor.

The GM, Steve Oseas is top notch. Our server Francesca was really terrific. The Somm, John Peiser, was very knowledgeable and personable. Our evening was really enhanced due to these three folks. Will recommend this place to all our friends and we well most assuredly be back.", "Date": "2016-06-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Spring Chicken", "ReviewID": "NNKHQEyHGn3Rfvld-qaxrg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "This is one of the best places in Vegas.  I've been to way too many big famous chefs' restaurants, and MOST of them were terrible: under deliver, and over priced.  I don't mind spending more, but it must be worthy the price.  I think Jaleo is so far the BEST restaurant in Vegas when it comes to food and drinks.  Service is another story.  But anyway, for the food, I can give in a little for the service.  1st of all, we ordered  Jose's gin and tonic .  Because it was labeled  It's the best gin and tonic you will ever have...  on the menu.  Personally, I HATE gin and tonic, but since 'it's the BEST , I had to try it.   They literary  MIX  drinks.  They used long skinny tweezers, carefully pick and put the ingredients in the glass, followed by a 2  diameter clear ice ball (perfectly made ice ball, with no bobble and all clear, trust me, it's NOT easy to make), then they added gin and tonic. 1st sip was  WOW, it's refreshing!   There was no strong nasty gin taste to it, you could taste the gin, just not the overwhelming nasty one.  $16  Usually, most Vegas restaurants take average 15-30 mins to bring food to the table.  But this place was impressively FAST!  The 1st dish was brought to the table within 5 mins, then within 10 mins after the 1st dish, we received all 6 plates of food!  WOW!!!!!  The cod empanadas was AMAZING!  Same technique and concept as the Philly cheese steak from Bazaar in SLS Beverly Hills.  It was light and airy, but with a nice concentrated cod favor, not too strong, it was perfect!  And it was well priced at $10.  This is a MUST-TRY.  The grill skirt steak with piquillo pepper confit was my favorite!  Perfectly cooked steak, evenly sliced, the pepper was well seasoned.  Actually the pepper taste EXACTLY the same as the Spanish pepper from Rivera downtown LA.    Paellas were good, touch too salty for my taste.  We ordered both the rabbit one and the lobster one.  The rabbit was slightly dry and overcooked, but over all, not bad.  The lobster was EVERY FRESH and PERFECTLY cooked through out!  And you actually get the whole entire lobster!  Great price!    Now I'm really looking forward for my chef's table at Jaleo Washington DC.  Most famous chefs opened one restaurant after another, they stopped caring about the food.  I think Jose Andres is the next Wolfgang Puck.  (I've been to a few Wolfgang restaurants, most of them were VERY disappointing: the food was not even good, slow and bad service, the drinks were not special at all, and the prices were way too high for the quality, expect WP24, but it's still a little over priced)   Just hope that all Jose's restaurants will continuing stay consistent.", "Date": "2013-03-11", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ken", "ReviewID": "sABhhOlPsmJ-1k6hobA8Vw", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Interesting place if you like trendy.

Jaleo was magnificent.  I loved the modern vibe, the wood-burning fireplace, and the atmosphere in general.  Even though I was a bit jet-lagged (we had just arrived earlier that day), my taste buds were awakened by the culinary masterpieces we experienced in tapas form.    The fried eggplant with a drizzle of honey had a delightful texture and were unexpectedly good.  I never thought that vegetable would be so good in a zeppole-like incarnation but it worked.  We had a savory spinach dish (I forget the name) which was quite good, but was outshined by the goat cheese with a bread that reminded me of Eli's raisin pecan crisps.  I wish I could have that for dinner tonight, but such is life.  The paella, our final small plate, had both rabbit and chicken, and was flavorful and not overly oily.  I tried a bite of the flan with oranges for dessert, which also did not disappoint.    Jaleo made me rethink the way I seldom go for tapas, and has given me the intense desire to try some of Jose's other eateries.", "Date": "2014-07-24", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Kim", "ReviewID": "xQ3YasVruoWM-3fA6vBBaQ", "Overall": "3", "Content": "If you like Tapas, you'll love this place.

The ambience is geared more for couples and small groups than a romantic date night setting. This is not a bad thing, especially in Vegas.   Every thirty minutes or so they would rat-a-tat-tat the pans with wooden spoons, follow it with a tat-tat, and the whole restaraunt would chant something. The kitchen was located in plain view of the restaurant and was cool to watch the sizzle snap crackle pops and flames.   Drinks:  They make specialty Gin cocktails. Ones that you would think go with vodka not gin. I'm not a big fan of Gin, but these unique drinks were a twist on some oldies. My drink tasted like a version of an old fashioned.   The sangria is delicious, smooth, and sweet. The ladies love it!!   Food:  The product is from Spain but the food is given the chefs rendition. I have had tapas in Spain and it was wonderful to have the same flavor profile but the food had a modern flair! It was perfectly cooked, beautifully presented, and wonderfully delicious.   Best prepared lamb I have ever had. Tender meat with chard edges.   Service:  AUBREY was our server and I can't say enough about how impressed we with her service. Friendly, entertaining, and over the top service. The restaraunt as a while had a great system in place which made sure there was never a gap in service and food was be being ran on a timely basis.   We ordered a dessert, which also is states on the menu, that it takes a little longer than usual. We didn't realize at the time, because we were involved in each others company, but Aubrey told us it was 25 minutes until the dessert came out.

This was probably one of the worst meals (in terms of quality and price) that I have had in many, many years. This restaurant has been on my foodie list for almost 3 years since I first heard of the popular Chef Andres. I always want to eat at his restaurants because i know it will be good. His restaurant in LA is amazing! Because of the hype I give this place in my mind, i was extremely disappointed and felt really cheated in a food experience.   My bf and i got the  Jaleo Experience  tasting menu. It was the worst representation of a tasting experience I've ever had. I am not trying to be mean, but i really was super sad and disappointed at the end of the meal..... PLUS it was EXPENSIVE. 2 tasting meals plus a beer, ($16 Chimay), a glass of wine, 2 espressos, and a lemonade was $220. I don't mind paying that much if the menu was amazing, so i was extremely upset. A tasting menu should be special plates off the menu that the chef is happy to serve to customers not plates that I felt like I could have made myself at home.  10 course meal included some of the following:  The beginning courses: 1 course was a plate with 4 pieces of manchego cheese: i swear i've had better cheese  1 course of tomato spread toast: I could have made this at home 1 course of ham with some  crouton  bread things  1 course of gazpacho soup: we both only had a few bites of it because it was too salty and not tasty at all.  There were a few decent courses such as 2 small pieces of lamb chops (a few bites tops) and the paella. The last savory dish was cold eggplant and red peppers. It was tasty but we were expecting something of more substance, like a meat dish to end the savory part of the meal. Maybe the paella could have been the last dish? The desert was okay but it couldn't make up for the rest of the menu.   For a $220 menu, we just expected much more..  If you want to content with your meal at Cosmo, go to the Pizza place next door and just spend your money on a couple of pizza pies or 2, or 3.

Cool atmosphere, excellent service, and delicious food!   Our server Corinne walked us through the menu and made wonderful recommendations. She also gave us an ipad drink menu loaded with lots of great looking cocktails and wines. We decided to go with the carafe of sangria for the table (it was so good we ordered another!).  To kick things off, we ordered the pan de cristal con tomate fresco with Pasamontes Manchego right away because our comfy booth was situated where we could actually see the guy making them, and it looked so good we had to have it! Delicious toasty bread with fresh tomato and Manchego cheese! We also tried the goat's milk cheese paired with raisin walnut bread and fig jam. This one was also a favorite of the night. Must try.   Next, we ordered the warm Brussels sprouts salad with apricots, apple and Serrano ham and the open fire-roasted red peppers, eggplant and  sweet onions with Sherry dressing. The Brussels sprouts salad was good, but nothing to write home about, and the peppers, eggplant, and onions were my least favorite of the night. Meh.  But hang on here comes the best part! Croquetas de pollo (chicken fritters in a shoe), Patatas bravas (potatoes with spicy tomato sauce and aioli),  'Rossejat' ('paella' of fried pasta with fresh squid and shrimp), and Gambas al ajillo (shrimp sauteed with garlic). The chicken fritters tasted like little fried chicken pot pies! Yum! The potatoes were also quite delicious. Everyone wanted to lick the plate because the spicy tomato and aioli sauce was so tasty! The fried pasta 'paella' and the garlicky shrimp were great also.  Whew, that was A LOT of food, did i mention this was a party of 3? But we HAD to try a dessert. So then this little chocolate hazelnut cake with prailine ice cream and salted caramel sauce appeared...and disappeared. Nutty chocholate goodness, but not too rich. A beautiful little treat to end a great night.  An evening at Jaleo is fun and delicious! And there is so much more I want to try!
