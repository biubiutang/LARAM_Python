Had my service light on no attention for 5 minutes. Casino royal supervisor\manager Kim came by with her slot tech Mike Asian guy bald head. Kim the supervisor yell at us why we have our service light on. Is there something wrong and walk away. Rude and no customer service at away and call us dumb. We got another attendant to help us and wanted to talk to the Manager. No one came by. Very sad. Would not come to casino royal even if they are next to white castle.", "Date": "2016-04-09", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Joe", "ReviewID": "BO3mci7XUPeomNG36xSMCw", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Fun place to go in and have a drink and gamble.

What else can I say? I can imagine every casino before the 2000's being just like casino Royale. Only negative is the ventilation, pretty bad smoke smell but that's expected with one of the last  old school  casinos still left.", "Date": "2016-02-20", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Valery", "ReviewID": "6NZs48DN_K9W1h0TiitopA", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Spent quite a bit on slots and I can't get a free water bottle?

No stupid entertainment tax, no dumbass Vendor Fee, the price they say is the price you pay. Great and friendly staff, even when busy they keep the drinks coming, and will even engage in some conversation now and again. Another plus, White Castle is right next to the bar so you can get some grease to coat that belly and keep on drinking!!! Special shout out to Darryl, he's a great guy and a damn good BT, but beware, when he say's you'll be back, he is always right!!!", "Date": "2017-01-07", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Rick", "ReviewID": "X64G8QeyY44TTAKfJ-GhHw", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Cheap place to gamble!  They have one dealer for 2 roulette tables!  They also have cheap craps and black jack.  And they are connected to white castle.

My husband and I have been coming here for a few months now, and it's our favorite small spot on the strip. You can't beat the $1 beers and Washington Apple shots for $5?! That's a steal. It is truly a gem in the middle of boulders. Very happy to have found this place, and will be coming back whenever we need to get out of the house.", "Date": "2016-01-22", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ari", "ReviewID": "W2MoqoePVpubVCO-LYicYA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Best place to grab some beer. We spent 7 or 8 bucks for two beers on tap which is the cheapest we saw on the strip, and service was very quick. Casino Royale is a rather smoky casino so if that bothers you, I wouldn't recommend this place.", "Date": "2016-06-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Priscila", "ReviewID": "piEIy3x9gO5TrWHuwaQYRw", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Don't spend a holiday at Casino Royale, Las Vegas ; $650 in coats ,yes, our winter jackets...

Tables have so many stains it looks like a murder scene and they smell like dookie. Dealers threw chips at us and would give us the wrong colored chips. This place doubles as a food court from hell. Saw a homeless guy sleeping on a slot machine chair and that was probably the cleanest thing in the place. If you're gunna go for the cheap booze bring a vat of hand sanitizer and shower immediately after.", "Date": "2016-07-03", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Suzy", "ReviewID": "SxxahJQv6taYP8DuPHSkbw", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Lame. Not allowed to use  F   word. Really? People in the military die for our freedom of speech.

This place is in dire need for a full revamping. This place is dirty and disgusting. You will never win here. I have tried over 20 times to win here and I have never come out ahead. The drinks are terrible and the service is sub par. The staff is rude and the hotel rooms are sickening. I give this place negative 5 stars.", "Date": "2016-09-20", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Paul", "ReviewID": "cZSbcTaD03GHKMypoI27jA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "This is my favorite bar on the strip. Michelob lights are only a buck. It's a dive and has neon light. Three Michelobs and two bloody Mary's was $9! This is a fun place to grab a drink and look at euro dudes who are smoking while they walk up to order and watch tv. The staff is constantly stiffed so if you tip you will make friends with the bartender. Remember sitting at the bar does not mean the bartender will come serve you, you need to order between the two gold railings and then move to a seat at the bar. Unless you tip well (1-2$ per drink) then they come over and smile and take your order.", "Date": "2015-09-26", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ervin", "ReviewID": "HN6qswLf8sC_izoBx5qP5g", "Overall": "1", "Content": "When you play craps in Vegas the idea is to get the crowds cheering and the pit staff to be somewhat friendly.  The old grumps are terrible.  You would think it was their money.  When I asked how long they had been working there,  to F)(*&) Long.  Sounds like time to retire.    Even with the crowd of us all cheering one another on, it barely helped, these older men, were terrible.  They hate their job, and they act like they are doing you a favor by taking your money.  When you reach a point you hate your job, move on.  It reached a point, which 6 of us left together.", "Date": "2016-12-24", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
