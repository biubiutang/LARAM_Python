There, I said it. Canes calls mayo and ketchup a secret sauce. It is no secret if you are over 5 y.o....now back to the beotches on here whining about  having to pay for sauce . Really? You think the Worldwide Sauce Conglomerate gives them sauce? Have you seen all the fat gutbuckets at the pizza place trying to get 5 more baby cups of ranch with their Hawaiian pizza order...a small? Those future cardiac patients are bad for our society. You are NOT entitled to a free cell phone, free rent, nor free sauce. If you want something, pay for it like the rest of humanity. If you really think you deserve to get for free what this couple pays for out of their pocket for, go get a death dog off the roller @ 7Eleven, chief! Get all the generic mustard and relish you can force down your gullet and live it up. Be sure to keep the slop off of your Bernie Sanders  I am a big boy now, but still want everything for free  presidential campaign tshirt.

It looks new/renovated. A very nice, clean place to dine in.  It was hard for me to decide what to choose on the menu. Everything seemed like something I'd order! The cashier recommended the chargrilled chicken over their crispy chicken. My husband and I decided to get one of each. The lady was right! I got lucky with my pick. It was so delicious that my husband kept picking at my plate lol.  Anyways, they also had lots of sauces to choose from. This was a plus in my books because I'm all about flavor. They definitely had it here.  I also got to try their  Lychee Lemonade.  If you come here, this is what you should drink with your meal. It was really good and complimented the food. The flavors just went together!  The only thing I wasn't happy with was their French fries.  If I honestly had to describe them in one word,  Basic  would be the word. We were told that they are seasoned, but all I tasted was some salt. In my opinion, they weren't bad, just not that good.

Nice, pleasant people working there.  I ordered the Mochiko Bowl with fried egg. I'm a simple guy and this was as simple as it gets - chargrilled chicken and fried egg over a bed of rice - however, the taste was amazing.

All I know is I LoVe it!!! Nothing better then bowl of rice topped with quality protein, side vegetables, and tasty sauces. Mochiko Chicken definitely hits all the things I enjoy about rice bowl. I know you can order fried egg on anything but being my first time wanted to try the bowl straight up. I came with another yelper Suzy H it was her second time so filled me in on the menu and the fact can add fried egg too any bowl. We ordered Mochiko Fried Chicken and Grilled Coconut Curry Bowl. Since with my yelp partner in crime like try lot of food. Also ordered the Mochiko Bites with Waffles.   The Mochiko Fried Chicken was solid. It definitely reminded me of local style back home taste shoyu in the crust (that darker side not light and crispy on the outside). Very addicting. You get nice amount of chicken in the bowl. The bowl is nice size not tiny bowl or is it expensive. Double hell yay!!! The side vegetables were good nice hot and fresh. I feel like could have use more seasonings. The sticky rice or could also order brown rice as option was good. The Grilled Coconut Curry Bowl that was the real winnah for me. I would ordered that over the Mochiko Fried Chicken easy. The reason is the sauce combine with the grilled chicken is tasty. The thing that stands out for me. It neither overpowering with the curry or the coconut. Just has that right balance. Both bowls the chicken was cooked perfect nice hot and moist on top of the rice.   The waffles not really fan. The bites is basically the same as regular Mochiko in smaller pieces. The Belgian Waffles maybe that the style cause not often order waffles more of pancake person. All I know is the Waffles were super heavy (no doubt deep fried or tasted like) maybe that the style? I don't know. It comes with side of honey. Honey did nothing for me change my mind about the dish. The bites one that would order again again.  It somewhat hidden in the corner of small shopping mall. Just look for Trader Joe in the same shopping mall it couple doors down on the corner. The service is awesome from the cashier to think might been the owner checking up making sure everything was good. The place not that big but few tables and stand up counter with stools. They have one widescreen just fyi.   Overall definitely fan and if am in the area plan on coming back to try more of the menu.", "Date": "2016-02-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "J", "ReviewID": "eVKXqjtsM0ABlSjbXViV9Q", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I travel to Las Vegas monthly and know that the best places to eat are not on the Strip.

Orders don't take very long to get. Decor is nice and new. Tried the Ohana meal and the Mochiko bowl. The Ohana consisted of a sweet roll, 4 chicken fingers, Asian coleslaw, and seasoned fries. The chicken fingers had a nice crispy crust with a robust blended seasoning. Chicken was moist and almost the size of a chicken breast. Love the choice of sauces. Tried the coconut curry sauce, Siracha sauce, and the Mochiko sauce. Love curry, so that was the winner for me. The Asian coleslaw has a vinegar kick to it and is minus the traditional creamy texture. The fries had a sweet and salty taste to them that provides a great flavor. Lychee lemonade was flavorful and refreshing. The Mochiko bowl was a healthy option, but was just as good as the other options. Wished they had desserts.

I ended up getting the Hawaiian Hen House (grilled chicken, Polynesian sauce, rice & a fried egg). You can add steamed veggies for $1.29 and choose to have the egg cooked to your liking. The chicken was cookies perfectly, and wasn't dry at all. The sauce was really good- although I haven't ever really had Hawaiian food, so I have nothing to compare it to. My husband ordered the fried garlic lovers bowl, which I didn't try, but it looked good and he said he really liked it. The entire restaurant was clean- the bathrooms were sparkling, which is amazing considering how busy they are. Everyone was REALLY nice. The price was very good for the amount of food we received.

I think that Mochiko is a great place to get a really generous portion of huge fried chicken breast tenders at a reasonable price.   But I have to mention that if you're from Hawaii like I am, the name is kind of misleading since this isn't mochiko chicken as we know it. This chicken is dredged and fried in rice flour (mochiko) vs regular flour, but mochiko chicken is supposed to be marinated overnight in basically a teriyaki/mochiko slurry then fried - it's sweet, salty, crispy & delish. So although I think that they make great chicken tenders, I personally don't really consider it  mochiko chicken , but that's me.    So as chicken tenders, I think these are good on value and quality - each piece is at least twice the size of raising cane's sometimes laughably small pieces. The chicken was juicy, lightly crispy and not at all greasy both times. I'm a fatty but I was full from just 2 pieces.   I had it with rice the first time, fries the 2nd - fries were seasoned but kind of soggy, so I'm sticking with rice from now. I accidentally spilled most of my sriracha sambal aioli onto my rice and it actually goes together really well all mixed up. I think that's my fav sauce so far, but I also liked the mandarin sweet chili. I figured it would be the usual bottled thai chili sauce, but chef maybe makes it from scratch? There were tiny pieces of candied orange peel like he added marmalade - it was a nice surprise.  I rarely drink anything while eating, because...I don't know why. But I can't resist their lychee lemonade - I even got a refill. It's more lychee than lemonade - a big cup of sugary goodness, a lot like Hawaiian Sun drinks. I really shouldn't, but I may have to stop in at least for a cup of this after any TJ visit.", "Date": "2014-09-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Eric", "ReviewID": "Hqzepd4UFjWah8mwLiWEsw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "For a resturaunt that specializes in chicken tenders, they have an excellent lychee lemonade. It has a very strong lychee scent and is very sweet for a lemonade. Not as much lemon tart as i expected. Still refreshing. Anyways, the ckicken is pretty fresh, they're battered with rice flour and remain juicy on the inside. The exterior has a nice good crunch. Their fries are similar, crunchy on the outside, relatively fluffy on the inside. The fries are also lightly salted. I didn't have much of the coleslaw, so I can't review that properly.  I tried the eurosauce, their house mochiko sauce and the sriracha sambal aioli. Starting at the top of that list, the Eurosauce... Its a very creamy, mayo-esque number with tart  creamy  feel that sits in the throat. Its similar to tartar sauce. The namesake sauce, mochiko sauce, is a creamy sweet sauce. It has hints of smokyness, garlic, and a peppery taste. Finally, the sriracha samval aioli, to me its mayo + sriracha, and I like sriracha.   This is their second day of operation and its already pretty smooth. Service was quick and the owners are on-site. They also have this quirky door that's got a shutter... And opens!

This is perhaps the only thing we've tried that I would have no qualms paying extra for. The Ginger Bowl was very colorful, and really strong, though I am not at all a fan of dyed foods. It was incredibly disappointing to find that the vegetables do not come with the bowl. They are charged as an add-on, which was highly disappointing. Presentation with vegetables always looks nice, and the flavors are there. The chicken is good, but not exceptional; it is, however, very filling. The overall experience was alright.

I was super curious and hungry so I was ready for a taste!  I was greeted by Jacqueline who is just the cutest gal with a sweet and welcoming personality.   I ordered the fried mochiko bowl $7.99, an ala carte chicken tender $1.29 and ala carte belgian waffle $1.59.  If you order an ala carte belgian waffle as informed does not come with syrup. Hmmm? I like syrup on my waffle so there is an extra charge of 50 cents. My favorite part of the entire meal was the belgian waffle. I could live on those, they are so good.   The chicken tender was good, juicy and flavorful however did not come with a dipping sauce. Once again it would have been an extra 50 cents. My Mochiko chicken bowl was white rice with breaded fried chicken chunks on top. I assumed from previous yelp photos I had viewed that there would be a sauce on it. My bowl needed something on it for sure in order to enjoy it.  I went and asked the employee if they have any sauce that I can add to my bowl. She replied yes, for what bowl, for the Mochiko bowl she suggested a sweet sauce. Also that will be an additional .50 cents. I had to have it because the bowl would have been too plain to eat without it. There was just too much white rice to have eaten it dry.   I just feel like all of the items I ordered needed something to complete them, sauce and or dipping sauce. I had the chicken tender , no dipping sauce, belgian waffle, no syrup, mochiko fried chicken bowl no sauce.    I think they should just increase their menu prices and include the sauce, dipping sauce and or syrup needed to complete the meal. After hearing  that will be an additional 50 cents  for the third time I was over the experience.   I may be back, however I think I will just get the chicken and waffles bowl.

When I want something healthy like a bowl , I get either the  Red Dragon  or the  Asian Q  bowl. They're both the same thing since it's basically chargrilled chicken and brown rice (although you can also opt for fried chicken and white rice) , they just have different sauces.  Red Dragon  comes with sriracha aioli sauce that I love. As someone who loves spicy food , it's not that spicy at all. I would describe the  Asian Q  bowl as the non-spicy version of  Red Dragon.  Veggies are extra sadly. Even though I hate paying extra for things (like guac at Chipotle lol) , I have to order my bowl with veggies. The veggies are steamed and have a slight buttery taste. They're a great accompany to the chicken and rice.  When I don't really care about what I'm eating , I get their bento which comes w/ fried chicken tenders , seasoned fries , choice of sauces , a Hawaiian roll and a drink. Their fried chicken tenders are the best. I personally think they're better than Cane's chicken tenders. Their lychee lemonade drink is tangy and refreshing. The only thing I don't like from Mochiko is the fries. Fries are not that great , we can't even finish all of them.   Prices are good considering they have big portions.

The restaurant is clean and quiet. You order at the counter and they give you a number while you wait at your table for your food.  I got the Hawaiian Hen House and I really liked the chicken and the sauce they coat it in. It has a creamy texture and brings out a slightly milkiness to the flavor. The chicken itself was marinated well and not that dry. I ordered vegetables on the side for an extra $2 which balanced the meal. I ordered white rice but they gave me brown rice. I was already hungry so I didn't want to wait for them to correct the mistake. Nonetheless, the bowl was delicious and the flavor of the chicken was good. I wasn't a fan of the brown rice, I usually eat healthier when I don't go out, so when I do go out I prefer to eat the white rice because it doesn't full the flavor as much.

A hawaiian sweet roll, instead of Texas toast? A tangy asian slaw, instead of a creamy coleslaw? And a variety of sauces for dipping, not just the one mayo-based BBQ sauce? If you're like me, you were probably wondering if there could be such a place...there is my friend, Mochiko Chicken offers just that and then some...  So, I just happened to be on the west side of town on some business driving down Decatur (starving, was lunchtime and I hadn't had breakfast...) when I looked up and saw a strip mall sign. At the bottom, in bold black and white letters it read  Mochiko Chicken ...I thought to myself, I like mochiko chicken! Better check it out...before I get too hangry.  Located on the corner of Decatur blvd. and O'Bannon Dr., right near the Trader Joe's. If you blink, you could miss it. It's a smallish, but bright and clean establishment on the inside, with a very friendly, welcoming staff. Mochiko Chicken offers up some asian inspired fast-food chicken bowls, grilled or fried. The fried chicken is coated with a lightly seasoned rice flour. I checked in with Yelp, and there was a $1 off coupon for the Ohana chicken tender combo...thanks Yelp!, sold! The Ohana combo comes with 4 pieces of their mochiko fried chicken tenders, seasoned fries (I substituted with white rice), a hawaiian sweet roll, Asian slaw and a choice of 2 sauces. The chicken was juicy and delicious, not dried out like tenders can be...pretty good sized pieces too. The Asian slaw was sweet and tangy, reminded me of the vinaigrette you would get with a Chinese chicken salad, was okay. The sauces I got were the Polynesian, a sweet creamy concoction, it was so good, I could've drank it...also, got the ginger-teriyaki sauce, nice strong ginger flavor, could smell it right away. The Combo also came with a drink, I got the Lychee Lemonade, was a thirst quencher for sure...not too sweet and has that distinct lychee taste (if you haven't had lychee before, you might not like it...)  I pretty much did a drive-by of this place, but I like Mochiko Chicken's business model...I guess with it's namesake, it better be some damn good chicken, right? I'll definitely be back, if I'm ever on that side of town again (and hungry).

I asked for veggies and sauce on the side. The chicken itself was flavorful enough and I didn't really need the sauce. The sauce was good though. It was like a Hawaiian version of Cane's sauce. The veggies were a good mix: carrots, broccoli, mushrooms, baby corn, snap peas and red bell pepper. 4/5  Srirachi Chicken Bowl: Grilled chicken and rice. Veggies added. The sauce was mildly spicy and tasty. 4/5  Lychee Lemonade: If you like lychee, you'd love this drink. I don't so, I don't really have an unbiased opinion about this drink.

Though, I must say, I was a little disappointed and quite unimpressed with the food. Though, the establishment was quaint, cute, and very clean. I like my places clean!   So my friend and I each got a bowl: I got the Hawaiian hen house, which was chicken on top of rice with an egg and their signature Polynesian sauce. My friend got their Mochiko bowl, which was chicken and their Mochiko sauce over rice. He also opt in for some veggies. Both of us checked in on Yelp to claim the Yelp deal of $1 off when you get a bowl + lychee lemonade! So we got the lychee lemonade!  The chicken is good. It was cooked just right, was tender and juicy .. not one hint of dryness. The sauce complimented the chicken and the rice very well .. for the first few bites and then it got a little overwhelming. The Polynesian sauce was mayo based so it was really creamy. As a personal preference, I could only take so much before it starts getting a little too heavy for my liking.   I also didn't really like their egg .. I wanted it over easy and they kinda over cooked it ): I was so sad that my egg yolk wasn't as runny as it should be!  It was pretty much the same for my friend. It seems that the sauce for his bowl was also mayo based. On top of that, he had a huge problem with their veggies. On the menu, it said the veggies were stir fry veggies but when he got them, they just looked like frozen veggies that were microwaved then thrown into the bowl. He was a little disgusted by that. I'm glad I didn't get any cause judging from the pictures on yelp, it did not look stir fried. Lol!   As for their lychee lemonade ... it tasted like lychee syrup water. Where's the lemonade? I did not taste a single hint of, well, lemon. I was hoping that it'd be more tangy than it was ):   Portions were huge though. I like how they serve it in a paper bowl so you only need a lid if you can't finish it (which I didn't) .. service was pretty good -- friendly smiles everywhere.

It was $1 more for vegetables. Which was fine because I don't like them, my friend did say yes when they were offered though.   While waiting for our food the restaurant got a couple customers who ordered for pick up.  I guess the cashier was overwhelmed because following the small rush she made some kind of  mistake in pretty much everyone's order.  The cook ended up taking out his own credit card to pay for a meal for one of the customers (....)  You may need to work on customer service, problem solving wise(.........)  The food came out pretty quick and was brought out, she forgot the vegetable in my friends dish and when we asked about it she just simply said she  didn't put it in the register   Um okay?

This wasn't a bad choice per say, but I honestly liked what I got previously. I also ordered the LYCHEE LEMONADE as my drink... and I am addicted. It's not too sweet, yet has a strong lychee flavor.

FOR HIM: He took my recommendation of what I got last time and ordered the ASIAN Q SIGNATURE BOWL, which is grilled chicken drizzled in Asian Q sauce & furikake on top of rice. (He opted for the brown rice instead of white.) We agree this is such a savory combo... The chicken is perfectly chargrilled and goes so well with rice. I found myself eating more of his food than mine honestly, lol.   *My only complaint is that extra sauce is 50 cents and comes in a very small container, which makes me very hesitant to try all the different sauces they have.

Good enough for me!  This place is in the Trader Joe's plaza, which I would have never found myself if Emily wasn't driving. The place is small and still looks new... because it IS new! Only open four days, and they're already killin' it!  I ordered the Ohana combo, while she got the Hawaiian Hen House, but we had already planned on sharing. The Ohana combo is four chicken strips, fries, coleslaw, a Hawaiian Roll, and a drink for $10. These are four GIANT chicken strips though... lightly breaded so it's crunchy but you still get the full flavor of the chicken, which was one of the best chicken strips I've had in a good long time. They were plump and juicy -- no dried out strips here! The fries also had an excellent amount of crunch.  They gave us a little bit of each sauce to try out, which was really nice, and this is where I got nervous, because some people get weird with sauce. (I'm looking at you, Rubio's... WHY YOU GOTTA DROWN EVERYTHING IN YOUR CRAPPY LIME CREAM SAUCE???!? But I digress...) My favorite was the Polynesian sauce, which was sweet and unlike anything I ever tasted. I should have asked what was in it, but I was too busy licking it off my fingers. The Sriachia sauce (I'm sure I misspelled that) was sweet but spicy at the same time, and wound up being Elite Emily's fave.  The Hawaiian Hen House was our other dish, great for someone who doesn't want fried foods. It was their chicken, grilled and chopped, served over rice with sesame seeds, a fried egg, and the aforementioned Polynesian sauce. It was ridiculous good. So good I have the leftovers and I'm super excited to eat it again. Who gets excited for leftovers, really? But I am. The sauce was sweet but not overwhelming, and like their strips, their grilled chicken is plump and juicy. The only downside to this was that the fried egg wasn't fried hard enough for either of our liking, but we were informed later that if we request a harder fried egg they have no problem doing it, so that's a nice save.  The staff was awesome! The counter girl was chipper, the girl who brought it to our table was nice and pointed everything out to us, and Jerry (the owner, maybe?) came out to us to chat about the food and what we liked and didn't like, and he seems really passionate about this place.

It is unfair for me to compare the chicken and sauce to the 808 garlic chicken powerhouses back home but unfortunately the tastebuds have a mind of their own and told me that its was just a jab-da-mout and not broke-da-mout good.  The grilled bowls that a few other patrons ordered looked much more appetizing and a better value.If I am very back in the area I'd be more inclined to try something from the grilled side of the menu.   The jury is still out on this place for me.", "Date": "2016-01-30", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jacqueline", "ReviewID": "kgL-a61sWeXV_F1q-Vfniw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I've came here a couple of times and tried several different things.

But it's even better when you have Mochiko chicken. This hidden gem is located on Decatur by Sahara, in the same plaza as Trader Joe's.   SERVICE Casual and friendly. They make everything to order so wait is usually 10-20min depending on how busy they are. I personally like placing a pick-up order on the phone so everything is ready to go by the time I get there.   ATMOSPHERE Modern and clean. They have few tables and a bar facing the parking lot. You get a good view of people pushing their cart from Trader Joe's and loading their groceries in the car. It is nice to see what people get and make a list of things to buy at Trader Joe's while eating at Mochiko. Maybe that's just me.   FOOD Hen House Bowl ($8.99) has a special place in my heart. This is the most popular grilled chicken bowl according to one of their friendly server. Hen House consist of chicken grilled to perfection on a bed of rice with Polynesian sauce. Then I get my egg sunny side up which makes this bowl a dream come true. Ono!  Asian Q Signature Bowl ($7.99) was recommended by my server since I always order Hen House and was looking for something different. It wasn't too memorable and wasn't anything special. The sauce tasted similar to Polynesian sauce on Hen House. Only difference was furikake but it tasted similar to Hen House for the most part.   The Bento ($7.99) comes with 3 piece of tenders, fries, Hawaiian sweet roll, coleslaw, drink and 2 sauces. They had about 5-7 different sauce options. I got to try their polynesian sauce, buttermilk ranch, barbeque, asian Q and coconut curry which all were some excellent flavors. My personal favorite has to be BBQ (I'm so basic, I know). I personally think polynesian sauce and asian Q are better with grilled chicken. This is definitely a great deal!  Lychee lemonade is perfect to quench your thirst. Too sweet for me but refreshing.

I have been recommend everyone at work to try it. This place has became a popular lunch choice for our company since then.   However, this last two times when I had it, the vegetables was flavorless, overcooked and soggy. The rice portion was off and most of all, not enough sauce on my chicken.   Today, one of my coworker wanted to make her curry spicy. I figured they won't be able to. We asked for chili powder which the cashier said they don't have. What kind of kitchen doesn't have chili powder? Then, I asked for chill flakes. Then she said they do have it but they will need to charge her for it. I found that highly unreasonable and ridiculous. We pay $11 dollars for a bowl of chicken and rice. We can't even get some chili flakes or powder.

As my previous review of Mochiko indicated, these were the best chicken strips I had ever eaten. HAD ever eaten. As part of their re-branding, the strips and French Fries are gone. Our lunch crew at work has dwindled recently, but when the boss asked  who wants Mochiko?  it was like Christmas had come early. The entire group went. My mouth was watering en route, in anticipation of those delicious chicken strips. What a disappointment. All they offer now are bowls, which were actually pretty good before. Not this time.   I'm not sure if it was my disappointment in the  re-branding  or just the fact that I had my mind set on chicken strips, but the Srirachi Bowl I got lacked flavor and spice, although it is advertised as spicy. Not only did it lack flavor and spice, it was lukewarm. And get this, the bowls DO NOT INCLUDE vegetables. You have to pay extra for veggies. A few in the party opted to go without veggies. Meat and rice in a bowl. Whoppie Do! Bland and Boring. My bowl, with veggies added and a beverage was just south of twelve bucks. Not worth it.   I don't know who pulled the trigger on the re-branding idea, but, in my Elite Yelp opinion, it was a mistake. Why not continue to offer the fantastic chicken strips AND the bowls? After all, variety is the spice of life, right? They have a fairly large TV in the dining area, but had it muted with subtitles and dance type music blaring through the speakers. It was too loud for lunch time ambiance. Had they dimmed the house lights, turned on a strobe light and had a cocktail waitress, they could have charged a cover.  There was a first timer in our group who thought her lunch was good. Maybe what they offer now may be ok for a Mochiko virgin, but having been there and done that, I will not be back. If I want meat, veggies and rice in a bowl, I will go visit the cute little black and white bear.

One of the main reasons is I feel like they read the reviews and listened to what the people wanted, and then made changes for the better. They had removed the chicken fingers that everyone loved, but I was happy to see they were back on the menu. My last review I had griped that the fries came out seasoned, and there was no mention of that on the menu, but I was happy to see that the menu has been updated to reflect that the fries are in fact seasoned! I thought the fries were still a bit too salty, but the fact that they made the effort to change will keep me coming back.  So for my lunch I chose the Ohana box which comes with 3 chicken strips, coleslaw, fries, a Hawaiian roll, 2 sauces and a drink for $7.99. They also have a 2 or 4 piece option as well. I paid, and then I went to get me some delicious Lychee lemonade, and saw that they added a new drink called Melonade. It was very good, but a bit too sweet for me. I ended up mixing both drinks together and adding a little water to lessen the sweetness and it was very good. Lychee-Melonade for the win! Anyway It did take about 15+ minutes for my food to come out, but they were busy preparing an Eat 24 order, so just FYI you can order for delivery through a third party. My food came out hot. The chicken tenders were juicy and delicious, not greasy at all and tasted great with a few of the dipping sauces I chose. They have about 10 to choose from and I chose the Asian Q which is the signature sauce, Thai peanut sauce which is new, and added on a coconut curry sauce for a small charge. I will say I enjoyed all but the Thai peanut sauce, which is odd because I usually love peanut sauce. Don't get me wrong, the sauce was tasty and flavorful, but it was cold as a dipping sauce should be, and that may be why I didn't particularly care for it. The fries, well I told you about those, next time I will get rice, and the Asian slaw was realllly good. It is a vinegar based slaw that had a slight tang as well as some sweetness. I ate it all up.

Owned by Jerry Misa, a former food-truck owner turned brick n' mortar almost two years back, Mochiko Chicken is largely a  do one thing, do it well  operation and with the bulk of the menu centered on boneless chicken breasts offered fried or chargrilled the choice of healthy versus less-so is still unlikely to cost diners more than $10, a downright bargain considering the quality and quantity of the meal.  Dividing the menu into several bowls - brown or white rice and Stir-Fry Vegetables available as a base - plus sides and individual fingers at 1/3 the cost of *other* places in town, those looking for something fresh and flavorful are encouraged to order the signature  Asian-Q Chicken Bowl  available with either fried or grilled meat seasoned with Furikake and Jerry's family recipe  Q-Sauce,  the flavor all at once unexpected yet familiar with a creamy texture that carries tangy top-notes and a touch of heat on the ending.  Explaining that Mochiko refers to rice flour, something even many in-the-know Southern Mamas have reported adding to old recipes in order to up the 'crunch,' Jerry states that his birth in the Philippines and time in Southern California paired to his mother's secret spice blend in coming up with the concept and with wife Sandra at his side providing excellent customer service, the time and care invested in the restaurant is readily apparent in Jerry's job duties, on this particular day fixing a roofing issue while also playing host and slinging samples of his collection of housemade sauces.  Avoiding spicy stuff as a half-day of work remained, Seasoned Fries provide an ample side for sharing while additionally offering a chance to experiment with the sauce and although personal preference obviously plays a large hand in all tastes I personally found the Coconut Curry, Satay Peanut andMandarin Sweet Chili to be most compelling, the housemade Lychee Lemonade also worthwhile to sip on as the Asian Fruit helps to mellow the harsher acidic tones.  Unable to resist Chicken and Waffles, Mochiko's fluffy squares turned out golden-brown with a light savoriness to the wisps of dough within, three fried strips fared well during the brisk walk back to the office and although I would have appreciated the  Maple Butter  warm the flavor was nonetheless exactly as described by the naming, the flavor excellent on the waffles leaving crispy fried chicken to be dunked in the other good stuff.  ****Family friendly, fast and affordable despite their obviously limited scope, Sandra and Jerry are doing great stuff at Mochiko Chicken and with options available for both fried chicken fans or those looking for a healthful lunch there are few doing it better anywhere around.

You can get crispy or grilled. We ordered the Hawaiian Hen House (grilled chicken with a Polynesian sauce over a bed of rice) and an Crispy Asian-Q (crisp chicken over bed of rice with an Asian-Q sauce). You can order vegetables with them and we did for a small upcharge and was complimentary with the chicken and rice.   The chicken was grilled fresh. We could see the grill covered with chicken when we walked in. The crispy chicken was not strips or tenders but chunks and was not heavily battered but lightly floured just for texture and carrying the sauces drizzled over them, nicely.   The Asian-Q sauce was a sesame-ish, creamy BBQ sauce that was nice with the crispy chicken and rice. Without it, I think the dish would've dry and maybe a little bland. The Polynesian sauce (on the Hawaiian Hen House) was a little sweeter than the Asian-Q but not overwhelmingly sweet or at all syrupy.  In fact it was really not obvious and then a nice surprise to find it was drizzled over the grilled chicken and atop the rice which had also absorbed the juice from the chicken. You should know that the Hawaiian Hen House also had a fried egg on top. It was a nice, and just added to the yummy rice already soaking up the chicken juice and Polynesian sauce. They make their own sauces, and there are others besides these two that I think we will return to try. They even offer you samples of you question or seem skeptical of a sauce.   The vegetables were nothing special on their own but went well with the chicken bowls. In sum, they were carrots and broccoli and squash that tastes steamed and a little buttery. I do recommend it with the bowls.   We didn't try the chicken tenders and fries but guessing because they cook fresh here and create their own sauces, you can bet they're pretty good too.   This place is accessible for all palates. The chicken is good and juicy and the servings are pretty generous too.   Him: Basically, the lychee lemonade is the reason to go here. It is not as sweet as plain lychee juice or lychee Calpico, and it quenches your thirst like lemonade. You have to order the crispy Asian-Q. The sauce was delicious. If you like BBQ with Asian flavor, you will love it. The chicken itself was good and not dry or fatty. I hate fat except like, bacon. It took quite a while to cook but I was starving, and then it was worth it. The rice and vegetables were ok, but the chicken and the lychee lemonade were the best.   My mom ordered the grilled chicken(Hawaiian Hen House). The chicken was tender and juicy. The veggies and rice were the same ok ones as the Asian-Q. Some of the chicken was fatty (thighs) so I ate around the day and liked the crispy chicken better. The sauce was sweeter than the Asian-Q and was really good too.   The bathrooms are really clean. The restaurant is not fancy. It is small and clean, and there are no waitresses.

As with the decor, the menu is relatively simple and straightforward. It offers Mochiko fried chicken and different types of chicken and rice bowls.   I tried the signature Mochiko rice bowl and was unimpressed. As a base option, you only get a big bowl of rice topped with grilled chicken and sauce for $7.99. The addition of stir-fry vegetables and a fried egg would've put the entire meal over $10. This is meal that could easily be replicated at home sans the mochiko sauce. I tried some of the Big Island Style bowl and found it to be over sauced, which drenched the rice in saltiness. The fried chicken on top of that bowl was reminiscent of the frozen fried bourbon chicken from Costco. Lastly, the lychee lemonade was unimpressive.

Quality and integrity and attention to detail is their  mantra.  Their heart and soul reverberates in every bite.  Yes, I am biased because Sandra & Jerry are my friends. But, wait, EVERYONE is their friends. They are such genuinely nice and caring and community and family oriented people that they invariably reach out to everyone with a smile, a sincere desire to please and to serve, a quest for perfection, striving along the way for honest feedback and learning how to give the public what they want in a helpful, healthful manner. This is a wonderful story of a loving native of Slovakia [who recently became an American citizen] uniting with a Hawaiian of Filipino heritage who have striven their way up the  food chain  of American small business, toward ever greater success. Starting with a food cart, they have scaled up their operations to this, their first sit down restaurant, by SERVING the public in every sense of the word. Their srirachi chicken with steamed vegetables reflects their quintessential American LOVE story in every morsel. So does every dish here. And there are multiple levels of LOVE in  play.  Clearly Sandra and Jerry's love glows - as does their love of service, their love of Las Vegas, their love of what they have achieved, their love for their dreams to continue to grow and to expand their loving influence via their culinary offerings. The place is unassuming and spotless, simple yet full of high tech innovations. Fast and efficient yet full of special fare which is full of thoughtful ingredients and preparation. But, perhaps, what struck me most and what touched my heart most palpably was when Sandra sat down and shared with me her story of how she and Jerry chose their location in the Trader Joes off OBannon & Decatur, next door to the Telus call center. Turns out that their bimonthly visits to that Telus call center parking lot next door created such a ravid following that those call center employees literally insisted, not just encouraged, this wonderful American LOVE story couple to open up business next door. Call center employees.  Think about THAT!  Get it? Everyday people with relatively minimal disposal income INSISTING that a restaurant open up so that they could visit daily with their hard earned money. I cannot think of a more revealing scenario and of a more tangible example of the value that Jerry and Sandra are offering to this community than the fact that call center employees knew they would serve them best. These are owners who assuredly and deservedly will continue to grow and to evolve and who will continue to grow in their following and success.

The atmo was mellow and the vibe was perfect with others silently devouring their meals...a very good sign.  At last all of our food would arrive.  I marveled at the size of the fingers and based upon their appearance..KNEW they would be just as delicious and juicy as they had been in the past.  Eating that first bite, I almost leapt from my seat with joy.  The fingers were indeed back.  The GF laughed at how happy I was.  The Mochiko version of chicken and waffles is as great for lunch as it is breakfast.  The crunchy Belgian with the slightly crunchy tender, lightly dipped in the syrup went perfectly with each other.  I was happy everyone else was full as it allowed me to eat a majority of it.  What a glorious return...we were fortunate to run into the owners whom I had met the second time I visited. We got to taste an experimental tender made to replicate Chicken Katsu.  It was a little more robust in texture and seasoning than the regular Mochiko tender.  I would love to see it on the menu someday.  We also got to meet the new chef.  What a happy, happy day as one of my favorite foods has returned to my favorite restaurant who knows just how to make it special.

With all the hype going on about this place, I needed to see for myself what it was all about.  Came at 12 and was able to beat the lunch rush.

Verdict: I think my expectations were too high that I felt like the bowl fell a tad bit short of complete satisfaction. The flavors are there, the chicken is grilled nicely, and they give a good amount of veggies to your order. But the veggies were somewhat overcooked and the sauce, a little too overpowering. It was good but I probably should have gone in blindsighted. Looking at photos that made me salivate and seeing such great reviews prior to coming here probably skewed my perception. I will say the lychee lemonade was pretty good. I actually liked how it wasn't so tart but tasted more like lychee. Refilled twice on it while I was there. If you like lychee, this drink is for you.

The drive over from the strip was worth it because the Trader Joe's was nearby and we stocked up on wine.  I would advise these guys to price in a way that allows people to spend more but also to get a slight break on the price. So if people like getting an egg or veggies then they should bundle  egg (or veggies) +drink  at $2.00 or something like that and they increase their total profit per customer while the customer feels like they got a slightly better deal than normal.  While $7.99 for a pretty tasty bowl of rice with chicken isn't expensive it is on the higher end of the scale for the  fast casual  category when you consider the sheer number of ingredients that go into for example, a chipotle burrito, a Cafe Rio salad, etc. all around the same price point or less.

Days prior to our FKT, my boss ordered me to try the Hawaiian Hen House with an over-medium egg and steamed veggies ... and fell madly in love.    FKT came around, but only a friend and my bf tagged along.  Our friend ordered the Crispy Asian Q with two eggs and white rice, my bf ordered the Crispy Mochiko with brown rice, and I had the Asian Q with veggies and white rice.  So the Asian Q is like the Hawaiian Hen House except without egg, and the Asian Q and Crispy Asian Q is basically the same thing except one is crispy, and the other is grilled chicken.   So here's what we all felt: the food is amazing and we we all fell in love with the food and the Asian Q sauce - It's a great spin for extra flavor. We love how the steamed veggies is fresh and not wilting.   However, we do believe it's a bit on the pricey side for a fast food joint. They should offer combos for their bowls, rather than paying extra for a drink. If one does not order the Hawaiian Hen House, which is the only one on the menu that comes with a fried egg, you'll pay more for adding an egg on the others - it shouldn't be $1.29 more, but the Hawaiian Hen House is $8.99. Steamed veggies should already be included in the price since it's advertised on their menu, but you pay another $1.29 more. Extra sauce? Uhm... yeah, extra.

I've been stalking this place since their signage went up in the Trader Joe's plaza months ago- they finally opened to the public today! Mochiko chicken is a Japanese-Hawaiian fried chicken that is marinated for 24 hours and breaded in sweet rice flour prior to frying. (According to Wikipedia)  Menu offers a few plates, bowls, and salads-  basic menu with different dipping sauces and a la carte chicken options. Ordered The Cali plate: two pieces of chicken, fries and coleslaw, with a Hawaiian roll and a drink. Interior is minimalist and modern with neutral colors, save for a beach painting on one wall.  The fried chicken here tastes more baked than fried, and has a slight sweetness with good crunch and a very fine breading. Dipping sauce was light yet flavorful. Fries are lightly seasoned, similar to a Cajun style. Coleslaw is not mayo-based which automatically made me like it over other varieties, and roll was soft and sweet.  But what really makes them stand out are the service and the lychee lemonade- Sandra was super friendly and upbeat, running the counter and telling me about the company. As for the beverage?

This place has become my default place for something healthy and tasty or when I can't think of anything else to eat. I've tried every item on the grilled side. Nothing on the fried side. Everything is essentially the same. You get some chicken on your choice of white or brown rice, and you can get a side of steamed veggies for an additional cost. You can also add an egg (standard on the Hawaiian Hen House) for a charge as well.The variations between items are the different sauces and some extra flavorings such as ginger. I do recommend trying something different on every visit, rather than getting Hawaiian Hen House every single time. Regarding the healthiness of the grilled food here: It's almost perfect. Brown rice + chicken, + veggies seems like a formula for a perfectly healthy meal! A super-critical health nut would probably say that the sauce is what makes this meal unhealthy. If you can look past that, or not bring a health nazi with you when you go to lunch ever, then you won't feel guilty at all when you eat here. They also have Lychee Lemonade there which can bust your calorie limit for the day if you drink too much. But it's damn good. They also had a new Ahi Tuna Poke bowl when I went there last. This was actually quite good as well. Good food is nothing without good service. I always get good service here. From Sandra herself to all of her staff, I always get good service.  The only negative thing I have to say for the sake of completeness is that your meal could get  a bit pricey. I wish the veggies were standard, but they're an extra $2. So if you get a Hawaiian Hen House, veggies, and a drink, you're looking at $13 before tip. This won't stop me from coming here at all.

They offer a wide variety of chicken served either fried or grilled with many sauces to choose from. Staff was friendly and the interior was clean. Portions of the food are fairly sized and will get you full, not too big and not too small. Make sure to order the lychee lemonade cause it will cream your pants!", "Date": "2016-03-16", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Robert", "ReviewID": "noNNqyLvBhwVD07dFuLvHg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I enjoyed my work lunch. I got the spicy mochiko. It wasn't that spicy to me however I have a high spicy scale. My wife got the habanero dish. She said it was very very spicy. There is very little seating. The actual chicken, which was fried, was not the best quality - mix of dark and white meat and fat.  I'll return for lunch. My lunch companions loved it.", "Date": "2016-08-30", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
