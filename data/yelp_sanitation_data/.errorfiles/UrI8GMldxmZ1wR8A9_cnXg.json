I was on a club crawl and the first stop was the Sayers Club.  We were given two 2 for 1 drink tickets and encouraged to buy mixed drinks at the bar.  I purchased a buy one get one scotch and soda (quite small and weak) for myself and one for my girlfriend.  I returned to grab the check 20 minutes later and the bartender brought a check charging me for five drinks at 96 dollars.  I explained that this was not the correct check and the other bartender who appeared to be more experienced showed the guy that he has grabbed the wrong tab and said that they would fix it, not a problem.  Ten minutes later the first bartender brought me another tab for $38 dollars which was still clearly an over charge and the wrong tab but we needed to go or we would lose the club crawl so I paid it and left a tip and decided not to worry about it.   When I got home the next day I saw that I had been charged around 84 dollars by the club, which was bizarre because it didn't even match either of the bills I had been presented with.  I called and left a message asking to be charged the correct amount.  No one has bothered to contact me back.  I get it, people make mistakes, I was even going to let them overcharge me and not sweat it.  But this is absurd and the fact that they are knowingly cheating me and choosing not to do anything about it has prompted me to write my first ever review.  If they choose to act honestly I will modify/remove my review to account for that.  However, at this point, this has been my experience.  Spend your money at a better club where they won't repeatedly screw up your bill and then steal your money.", "Date": "2015-09-10", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Paul", "ReviewID": "wXaYeFVl-CVwmQaseRLAOA", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Johnny Walker Black and Double Black tasting.

If you have questions, issues, work with your patron, and they'll be loyal to you. Don't refuse, or say no. Sorry. Tough. Especially when it's a reasonable request.  I originally intended on attending a Hollywood event by Sayers, but after finishing buying a ticket, I noticed the ticket was for Las Vegas. Your website redirected me to Vegas instead of Hollywood. This is a programming error, I selected Hollywood.  All I asked is for a refund, exchange, or something, so I can go to Hollywood instead of Vegas. I still wanted to be a patron, but instead, I get a flat out no. We don't do that.  Blanket policies are the worst, it shows you don't care about your customer and only want the money. So enjoy my $90 Sayers SLS, I won't be attending. I hope it was worth losing a customer for life.

I know this is Vegas but I've never been charged for bottled water when ordering a drink, nor have I had my drink tickets used for said water.

I played tourist today and came straight from arriving to Sayers because Miguel Migs, Marques Wyatt, Mark Farina with live vocals of Lisa S were spinning and a few friends wanted to go.  It's a small indoor space with a majority being couches for bottle service and a stamp sized  dancefloor  in front of the stage. It does have a nice long patio overlooking the street.   The bar seems to be better than the average night club selection and their cocktail menu looks decent. I did not try a cocktail because I'm currently on a alcohol free cleanse of sorts.  The sound quality inside was definitely good. I am a fan that they are bringing in acts that I don't see headlining other clubs and lounges often.   It is what it is.

We had bottle service, and the waitress was very attentive.  She brought over our round of shots in record time.  Around midnight, the club immediately got crowded. It was as if a party bus had dropped off a hundred people.  Most of them crammed around the DJ and tried to jump around and dance, but it wasn't enough room for all that.

Went there with my mom on Friday late night (August 28th) and it was nearly empty (not surprised why now looking at their overall reviews). Ordered 2 drinks at the bar. They do not have a drink menu so you need to tell them what you want. I think that is a huge loss as it would be nice if they had at least some club signature cocktail menu. We ordered vodka with orange juice and gin matrini. We paid 38 $ and to have drinks served in plastic cups. It was explained that these are  'Vegas regulations'. I am willing to understand that but what is unforgivable is that drinks were bad. My martini was not cold enough and tasted bad and when I complained to bartender he gave me an attitude and moved on. C'mon how difficult is to make gin martini? My mom's vodka/orange juice was watered down....Maybe that is the reason that they do not have a cocktail menu as the guy who served us may not be qualified to serve anything else but shots. When I made sour face and proceeded to take a photo of drink suddenly manager came over and offered new drink. Well manager was nice and obviously tried hard to make things better but they need to change bartenders or at least train them properly. The one who served us was a young guy Christiano Ronaldo look alike who definitely needs fist of all attitude adjustment (or maybe changing jobs to field where he fits better) or at least a bar tending course. If your customer does not like a drink and tells you right away about it it should not escalate to the point that your manager needs to intervene. I must say it was a huge disappointment as I often go to SLS in LA for drinks & desserts and they have amazing cocktails. SLS and Sayers Club in Vegas unfortunately does not meet the same standard. I would never recommend this place.

It was a Monday night.    We parked at 9:30 in the garage, after the valet said they were  full  with their hands out.  Valet was almost empty, and this new crew of newbies (admittedly not any of the few veterans of the industry I understand they did hire) was obviously hustling the property for $20 tips to park.  I'm not adverse to having a $20 option on a crowded night, but you drive past the valet lot on the way into the garage - empty.  This kind of thing tends to happen when the typical clientele is not tipping, and the valets want to park less and get paid more.    We arrived at Sayers Club at 9:40 p.m. They had already done last call!  We walked through the bar and to the outside area.  It looks nicer from the street.  The design is disjointed and partially blocked off by other event space.  We got the canned speech about the 'battle of the bands' they plan to have as nightly entertainment.  Sounds like high school approach to what is billed as a sophisticated venue - no thanks.  And what's with closing at 9:30 on 'school nights'?  They told me they will only be open later Thurs, Fri, Sat.  What a joke.    SUGGESTIONS:    I've been here 45 years.  I worked at the Sahara 35 years ago.  I have friends who worked there when it closed, and work there now.  The PR says SLS is after locals.  Ok, let's get local then.  1.  No 'school nights' hours.  Stay open until at least midnight, better 2am 2.  Put a dress code in the club.  No slobs.  Grown men have no business wearing shorts into a restaurant or bar.  Get serious. 3.  No 'battle of the bands' BS, no 'dueling piano's' hustle.  Get sophisticated lounge singers and musicians which you will find at La Casa Cigar Lounge, The Barrymore, Zebra Lounge and others.  Not background music, but not loud either - sophisticated.  Grownups like to have conversations while we have a serious drink.  If you want serious bucks spent, don't cater to the mating rituals of the twenty-somethings. 4.  Iron out that patio deal.  Get rid of the gates or whatever that is and get some good seating out there, with no piped music unless there is no live music inside, and if you do pipe it in, make it sophisticated sound.  The slogan of SLS is  Be Legendary .  Sayers Club is the high end bar at the SLS, and is far from legendary.    But it could be.  Opening week is tough, and there are always bugs to work out.

It's not even really a place to pick up girls/guys, although that might happen if you play your cards right.  It's a place designed to experience music in an intimate, upscale setting with friends over drinks. Target demographic is mid-20's professional - late 30's professional. (Girls closer to 21 are, obviously, always appreciated). It's a place where the clientele wouldn't need to be told that sofas are reserved for bottle service.  This venue has all the familiar elements of the LA location: plush leather sofas and a somewhat industrial feel. But, in typical Vegas fashion, it's a bit bigger.  I had a great time this weekend, but I knew what I was expecting when I arrived. Since my wife and I were guests of the SLS, we got in free and didn't wait in line.  What's ultimately going to make or break this place are the musical acts they can lure here. I've seen Prince perform at the LA location.

So now the place is crowded and we are left standing. After 15 minutes and milking our drinks, I wondered where the band was. When I asked a bouncer, he said they would be out at 11:30pm. So we thought we would wait another 15 minutes, then 20, then 25, and at 11:45 we asked a bartender where the band was. He said they would come out whenever they felt like it, but are suppose to play a quick set by 12:30. I was already bored and all there was to do is watch everyone trying to talk over the loud music. I never saw anyone getting a second drink, and some guys weren't touching their drinks for over 20 minutes. Others were suckers and bought girls drinks, and all the girls had to do was take selfies with the guys. Total Suckers! By midnight we left, I couldn't take it anymore. I would have had more fun blowing my $36 dollars in 10 minutes on the slots or at craps. This was a total waste of time and money, and I could afford this place. If you have deep pockets to burn through money you don't care about, while you sit or stand listening to music. If that defines fun for you.

Very cool decor, ample seating, including heated patio. The Only problem is the cost of a glass of wine. The line was Very long for the R&R Wine so I thought I'd just buy a glass from the bar. Of course I didn't expect it to be free but $19 for a half glass of cabernet is a bit steep. I can only imagine what a Martini costs...", "Date": "2016-02-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Essential", "ReviewID": "rxFjFKLMTKnOyWGhqscA_g", "Overall": "1", "Content": "It sounded unusual when the Bunkhouse shows were moved to Sayers Club and the experience of attending Savages convinced me to never return. Tickets (sold by Sayers Club, not the Bunkhouse) said 9pm start. Upon arrival, the ticket agent said doors weren't until 10pm because they had another show in progress. The manager informed us the band would be on by 11pm. At 11:30pm, the band finally took the stage after 100 or so fans stood near the makeshift stage in a freezing  ultra lounge  that was being filled with club goers. I cannot imagine a worse environment to see the post-punk Savages. The town will never take root as a music city for non-DJ's if this is the best we have to offer them. The staff were pleasant but the club is not ready to host rock and roll concerts.", "Date": "2015-08-22", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
