What can I say I'm a sucker for awesome goodness!!!  Took some friends here who were visiting from out of town and introduced them to the yumminess of honey toast, not just any regular honey toast but with fresh fruit, whipped cream and vanilla ice cream. Talk about mouth watering its great, just don't go if your on a diet. You know that they say the best things are usually not good for you.   We also shared shaved ice with strawberries and kiwi. It was different from some other shaved ice, added more condensed milk to make the ice softer and smoother but definitely not bad.

I never been so never twist my arms comes too trying new spots in Vegas. Good ones that fellow yelpers rave about! Icy Juicy was awesome I had come back second time share the experience another group of yelpers that first timers too. Thank you Terri!   Talk about small location. It located next too Cafe Moda in this little shopping plaza. Unfortunately not lot of parking depending when you go. I ended up parking across the street walked acorss. So hopefully able too find spot because its really hidden gem comes too dessert. Not many seats inside but back up always order your stuff too go. The menu is pretty diverse not just Boba more Boba and really highlight is the Snow Ice. Interesting. They put the hot food in back of the menu so if not look at it never know serve real food too. We did not partake in the food food. Sure there will be another time that try some of their food.   The things I did try back-back nights was the BOBA. I love Tapioca Balls!!! The Tapioca Balls are awesome! They not skimp on them AT ALL. It Tapioca heaven ever spit till the very end. BOBA no expert but feel like not overly sweet but just the right balance. The first night I tried the kiwi-strawberry flavor Boba. Solid. Honest the second night the Mango Flavor was da bomb! So many more different fruit flavor too try sure just might find another one better. The Snow Ice thank Thanks too Terri for sharing truly the star dish at Icy Juicy. Being from Hawaii love my Shave Ice with mochi balls/ice cream. So hard too find any substitute like real kine Shave Ice. Snow Ice pretty darn close too legit. It different texture lot more smoother flakes of ice, comes with beautiful fresh cuts of fruits (kiwi, strawberry, etc), condense milk extra touch of sweetness over the top of the ice cream (you get choose different flavor ice creams), and love the presentation with the valentine shape bowl. Sure one that next trip going get my snow ice in!!   One thing mention about the service is our server not talk english all that well. It came for asking for recommendations she not much of help. It comes too the check better off flagging them down or takes forever. Overall service if fine.

Also, I was originally looking for Quickly, but apparently they closed down and Icy Juicy took over their space, so Icy Juicy it was.   Anyway, I decided to get the taro smoothie with boba and egg custard. Since I never carry cash, I paid with my card, and was informed that they have a minimum of $15 for credit/debit card purchases. Kinda annoying, but I really wanted that smoothie, so I ended up getting some calamari and fish balls to meet that minimum.   The smoothie was super tasty, exactly how I liked my taro. The boba was nice and chewy and the egg custard was a great addition. I thought that the egg custard's flavor might clash with the taro, but they actually worked well.   The food, on the other hand, were ok. The calamari was your standard calamari. It was nice that it was not overcooked. However, when it got cold, the old oil taste was definitely prevalent. The fish balls were the kind you get at Asian restaurants, but I liked that they added extra seasoning to make it more their own. I definitely enjoyed those more than the calamari.   Anyway, I'll definitely come back for more of their boba. However, I'll probably skip the food.

Looking at it, I realized it was way too much for me to eat by myself. I also then saw that there were kiwis in it. I had to pick them out since I am allergic to them. The milk snow ice was super creamy and the strawberries and mangos were ripe and sweet. They drizzled the top with this syrup that was way too sweet for me. After I ate all the fruit, I had this big puddle of diabetes syrup and melted snow ice which I could not finish. Overall, it wasn't bad for my first time there.

I'm always going to get some flavor of shaved ice along with an appetizer. I think it fits well together. I usually like to eat something dry and something wet to balance each other out. If you get what I mean.  Anywho, you pick a type of snow ice (there's multiple toppings) and then you can pick the flavor of the ice. There's 3 types: milk, green tea, and mango. If you get a chance, try all 3 and see which you prefer. I've only tried the milk flavor.  It's different from the shaved ice I've had in Cali (Class 302, for example). It's sticky and the Cali ones aren't like this. Either way, this is probably the best you'll get in Vegas. The shaved ice in Cali are amazing. But this is snow ice so I'm not sure if that difference matters.. yet.   The 3 dishes I've managed to get here (deep fried squid, Taiwanese sausage, and fried tempura) are all pretty good. I'm surprised. I was also really cold on my second visit and decided to get this hot drink - coconut milk tea (I usually get the cold version) and it was VERY yummy. I love it. Coconut isn't most people's thing so get the flavor you want. But I loved it. It was so yummy. I'll definitely be getting it again and again. If you get drinks a lot here, get a stamp card. The prices add up.  The service has been friendly. It's easy to call them over - just let them know you need something. It's probably cause they're a new place so their service isn't crappy (at least none that I've had). I'm going to end up trying all the food on the menu. They've also got different flavors of toast! If it's your thing, give it a try.  Definitely give this place a chance. There's some grand opening specials right now. One of them is a 10% off to-go drinks. There is also a $15 credit card limit.

The service is good and the owner is nice, will ask for feedback and seems to appreciate your patronage.  I'm not going to lie. It is a little FOB-y with the Chinese-to-English translations like  top sales  instead of  best sellers  or  sala  instead of  salad  but you tend to overlook these things because the snow ice (which comes in green tea, taro, mango or milk flavors) are so good. I'm told the food is good too but I haven't tried any yet, so I will take advantage of their  free drink with lunch entree  offer next time.  I would rate this place a solid 4 stars or maybe a little more. I only wish they offered even more authentic Taiwanese toppings like rice balls and fresh taro (which could also be used in hot grass jelly).

Check out a few photos and you'll end up bookmarking this place.   I've had this place bookmarked for one reason...BOBA!!!  I just wasn't going to drive out of my way to get it.  Well, tonight worked out perfectly since I was across the street having dinner with Terri R.  Terri brought this place up, pulled up a few photos from other Yelpers, and I was sold. One issue though, everything that looked really good had fruit in it and I can't eat fruit.  So, plan B (i.e. Plan Boba) was in effect.    We were too lazy to use the crosswalk or get in our cars, so we played a little Frogger by jaywalking and dodging a few cars.  We got to Icy Juicy in one piece.  Even better, I'm considering this my cardio for the night.    Icy Juicy is a small restaurant that serves a plethora of treats from snow ice, boba, yogurts and a bunch of fruit creations that is best described through pictures.  Everything looked and sounded good.  I opted for the Cappuccino Slush w/Double Boba. My drink was delicious and cold like it's suppose to be.  My favorite part was the warm boba with each slurp.    Looking forward to taking the family here when they're in town.  Next time I'm here, I'm trying their Monster Toast minus the fruits.

When I go out, I go all out. The string of reviews did not happen in a series of days, but all in one.  I had some time to kill after getting my haircut and before I had to pick up my sister. Vetoing the gym for a day of relaxation, little did I know I would fall so far off the bandwagon. I started by ordering a large Grapefruit Green Tea with Aloe Vera ($5.00) thinking it would be a 24oz serving, but it came out in a mug that puts Hofbrauhaus to shame. The tea is bold and not bitter at all. The grapefruit flavor is light and not too sweet. The aloe vera were large chunks and came in a generous portion. Then the next step was where I went horribly wrong. I ordered a Rose Yogurt ($3.75). Little did I know it was another drink. I thought it was going to be frozen yogurt since the bottom of the page were lined with pictures of this creamy treat. When the employees asked me if I wanted to wait for it, I was a little thrown off, but it should have been a clue. The Rose Yogurt reminded me of those little bottles of yogurt drink  I use to get from the Asian supermarkets. It was ok. I would totally stick to the teas.   The best part, my folly was not that bad since they are running a special. Until December 7th, tomorrow, they are doing half off drinks if you check in on Facebook and like them. So both of my drinks came out to be five dollars and some change.   The staff is nice, but there is a language barrier. I don't speak Chinese, but the barista kept talking to me in Chinese.

The mangoes tasted canned (does that even exist?). It just didn't taste like a fresh mango at all. & the milk snow cream tasted like a really strong brown sugar or waffle or something idk how to even describe it. It wasn't as good as it looked.   Other than that the service was good and it's a nice place to catch up with friends or maybe even study. But so far the drinks are just so-so.

The first time I heard about this place was when my friend told me that Icy Juicy makes drinks comparable to those at Tea Station, but at a cheaper price. Being the boba lover that I am, I wanted to try this place out for myself. The first time I went , I was on my way home from work so I wanted to place an order for take-out. When I went in, the waitress handed me the menu and was literally tapping her foot while I perused the menu as if to say  Hurry up, you're wasting my time!  And mind you, it took me less than 2 minutes to decide what I wanted. Then when I reached in my wallet to pay with my debit card, she said,  We can't use card for purchases under $10 (it could've been $15, I forgot).  Nowhere at the cash register was there a sign telling me that they didn't accept cards for orders under such and such. Luckily I did have cash with me that day or otherwise it would've been game over.   Their peppermint milk tea is almost the same as the one at Tea Station, I'll give them that. The boba is a bit too soft for me, almost as if it's been sitting in the pot for too long. Prices are decent, about $2-$4 for a drink. They do have cooked dishes and snack options, but I have not tried any so far. Icy Juicy is open late so I suppose it is an alternative to Tea Station, but I honestly don't see what the big deal is about.

I admit, the only reason why I went here in the beginning was because it was conveniently located right next to where I always hang out, but over time, I found myself constantly coming back for more.  To sum it up, Icy Juicy's drinks are comparable to the ever so popular Tea Station[Planet].  The drinks are delicious, atmosphere very relaxed, perfect for big group meet ups. However,  keep in mind for those who are not used to going to these types of Asian owned establishments in the China Town area...it is extremely Asian! (Chinese waiters, Chinese music, Chinese writing on menus and mostly Chinese/Asian regulars). If you're expecting diversity, not a cultural experience, then go elsewhere.   Icy Juicy serves not only milk teas (approx. $3-$5), but also has the typical snow ice/shaved ice (approx. $5-$6), slushies (approx. $5), and flavored teas (approx.$4-$5).  All of their milk teas are very flavorful, dark yet equally milky. My favorite to order of all time is their royal milk tea (has a ginger taste to it), milk tea (rich and heavy with the perfect combo of creme), and their green milk tea (a light  refreshing drink, more tea than creme). Their boba is also very good, always soft and because of their popularity, always made regularly and fresh. If you're not a fan of boba, try their lychee/ coffee jelly instead. It is guaranteed to renew your taste buds.  They also have finger snacks such as spicy chicken (approx.. $5), and a variety of other fried finger foods coming in at second best (approx. $4-$6), and entrees coming in last (approx. $8-$12). My favorite snack of all time is their spicy chicken, and their crispy squid. Both are very deliciously, and have flavorful batter that tastes like garlic and chili spices, rather than just meat dipped in flour that was deep fried. If you're here to drink tea and eat snacks, it's a perfect combination. But if you're here expecting to get a quality meal, my suggestion is to save your money and go eat elsewhere, then come for drinks/ desserts afterwards. They claim to have  Taiwanese  food, yet a lot of it is not authentic and poorly executed. If you have to eat there, my suggestion is to try the pork chop rice ($8---2 large pieces of pork chop, eggs & cabbage, ground pork, rice), and their specialty sizzling noodle ($12). Those are the only 2 that I think is worth it. IMO, their soups are the worse (flavorless and taste like water).   So if I have many good things to say about this place, why did I give it only 3 stars? Don't get me wrong, their drinks are delicious, and when it comes down to a boba shop, taste is really all that matters. However, the main reason why this place was set back a star on my list is because of it's often lacking service. To be fair, there are certain waitresses here (all Asian and most cannot speak English fluently) are very sweet.. yet there are a few who work during the late night shifts that I hate to deal with whenever I come in. They are 2 girls in particular who are very inattentive, distant and seem almost unwilling to help just because I do not speak Chinese to make it easier for them. On top of that, when this place gets busy and I mean they often get full house/ full lobby during late nights and weekend, it's often very hard to get any service, especially if you are not part of a big group they  trying to serve first. This place could use more staff in my opinion and tables (even though I don't think that's possible just  because it's not a very big place.. they would have to do some major reconstruction)..Overall, aside from those minor flaws,  I definitely recommend Icy Juicy for anyone interested in making pit stops and trying out the Asian boba culture for the first time.   *CASH ONLY BTW!*", "Date": "2012-07-18", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jadyn", "ReviewID": "iuGFUUpWG46Lw9ygLGFRuA", "Overall": "3", "Content": "I give Icy Juicy a 3.5 star.

Usually, it's because I have so many things to do during the day, that it's hard to stop by a boba place since the good ones are mostly all in Chinatown... Anyway, Icy Juicy is one of those late night boba places that offers a wide selection of different flavored drinks and food. I came here with a friend after having a long day, and both of us were craving boba.   They have a few tables inside if you plan on sitting down to enjoy your snacks and drinks, as well as limited seating outside. It can get crowded, especially at night because of the other establishments around it that are open late as well (karaoke joints, bars, etc.)   We looked at the menu after being sat, and decided to get appetizers with our drinks. We ordered their garlic mussels (comes with 6 pieces) and crispy chicken for our snacks. For drinks, I ordered the peppermint milk green tea and the banana milk tea all with boba because I couldn't decide between the two (I hate being indecisive sometimes lol).   It was a surprise to me that they offered mussels as a snack option here. I thought  why not?  and was actually glad I ordered them. These mussels tasted so good and they practically melted in your mouth. The garlic on top didn't overpower the actual taste of the mussels, so they're great in my book!  The crispy chicken is their take on Taiwanese popcorn chicken, which is normally what I would order as an appetizer when enjoying some boba. These bite-sized pieces tasted so good, they're actually quite addicting. They're like potato chips -- you can't eat just one!  The drinks, however, were not as good.  The peppermint milk green tea had the initial taste of mouthwash. While shocking to your tastebuds at first, the taste mellowed out and didn't taste as mouthwash-y. This drink has a very strong mint flavor for sure.   The banana milk tea tasted like bananas, but it was a little subtle. I didn't really like this one because it ended up having a weird after taste and the color of the milk tea was not appealing whatsoever.   I didn't completely finish either of them, but at least the boba in these drinks were perfect and not hard or mushy at all!  I think the food is better than the drinks here, but that's just me.

It was both tart and a tad bitter, but got better as the melted ice diluted the drink. I really like the consistency of their honey boba, since it was cooked properly and tasted lightly sweet.

This place is open until 2 AM. A group of friends and I came in for some sweet goodness at 11 PM. They tell us they're out of boba. What? How can a boba shop be out of boba? It's like going to an Italian restaurant and saying that they're out of pasta or going to a nail salon and saying they're out of polish. They didn't offer to make anymore boba balls which confused me because there were other customers walking in while we were there.   2. So this place offers different sweetness levels on their drinks. Unsweetened, lightly sweetened, regularly sweetened or super sweetened. We were excited to learn about this since we're trying to watch our figures and limit sugar intake. All drinks were ordered as  lightly sweetened  and all but one drink came out regular or super sweet. What happened here?  3. Customer service is terrible. TERRIBLE with all caps. The girl that was serving us had a real nasty attitude and was real pushy with our orders. I wonder if she ate all the boba before we showed up and had a bad stomach ache or something because girlfriend was cranky. My boyfriend and his family came in and I asked our server to put their drinks on my check. She shot me a dirty looked and looked absolutely confused. All I wanted to do was pay for their drinks. Hmm. Ultimately, she got things figured out but I had to go over mountains and cross oceans to do so.   Three strikes, you're out.

My friend took a bite and it actually got caught in her throat. She had to dry heave just to expel it. I had to keep spitting out pieces. It was too difficult to eat and not enjoyable since every bite had to be taken with caution; I was waiting to break a tooth. Also, I'm not familiar with Asian foods too much, but when I ordered sweet and sour pork, I expected a somewhat traditional sweet and sour sauce, but what I got instead was I'm almost certain teriyaki sauce. It was good, but not what I ordered. Not sure I'll ever go back, mainly because I went on a whim, but I'm still disappointed.

I asked the waitress her recommendation between the two I was debating between and she quickly told me that the iced green milk tea was her favorite.   Done, that's what I ended up ordering with boba. I enjoyed the iced green milk tea, but I also felt that it was very sweet. It left a film of sugar on my taste buds. I waited until the ice melted a little bit more in order to drink it, but by then my taste buds were toast- or shall I say sugar bombed.   My boyfriend ordered the iced coconut milk tea with boba. His drink had a thick powdery consistency and the coconut flavor had an annoying artificial aftertaste. We both preferred my drink over the two.   The boba was the best part. It was cooked perfectly and had the right amount of firmness and softness. It was also pleasantly sweet. I'm glad they at least got one thing right. I've been to boba places where thier boba tastes like dishwasher.   We checked in on Facebook and also received 10% off on our order. The total for two drinks and the discount was about $10.

Thus when they shave the ice, the flavor is already evenly distributed into the shaved ice. I think this is also what give the shaved ice nice silky texture. - They are very generous with fruit topping. I recommend go with the mango and stay away from the red bean.

She did run the card anyway cause I didn't have cash on me. Didn't feel too welcome honestly. Not sure if this is all  part of the theme or not, but ok, no big deal.

Their drinks are good but their service is hit or miss. They aren't very attentive but it's probably because the customer service demand is pretty low maintenance. Most people will come here and get a drink and sit for at least an hour to hang out with friends. Sometimes they run out of boba and the wait is at least 30 minutes. How does a boba shop run out of boba?! That always baffled me.  The food is great! My favorite has to be the crispy chicken and the sizzling steak with spaghetti. My mouth is literally watering as I am typing this! The crispy chicken is a great treat to share with friends. It's a pretty decent portion for how cheap it is! And the sizzling steak... omg! That is amazing. If you haven't had it before, please try it! It comes with a salad first then the steak comes out on a stone plate with spaghetti, an egg and the steak on top drenched in either mushroom or black pepper sauce. My favorite is the black pepper. The steak is always a little undercooked but I like it that way because I  can always just move the noodles out of the way and put the steak on the stone plate. It's much better than getting an over cooked steak IMO.  Anyways, another reason my friends and I come here is because they are open late and can seat a bunch of us... sometimes 15 in one area! Icy Juicy is located in a very busy shopping center. It's pretty hard to find a parking spot and sometimes, I have to park in the shopping center next door or across the street! It's pretty inconvenient but there isn't another place I have found that is open late and can seat all of us so we're not really left with much option.  Oh! Also, if you aren't a fan of cigarette smoke, try not to sit near the entrance.

Now for the service. Service has always been inconsistent here, ranging from attentive and polite to frustrating and exasperating. I think it largely depends on who is working there when you go. It is also owned by Chinese folks, and a large portion of their customers are Chinese, so communication may be rough if you don't speak Cantonese or Mandarin. They are usually pretty quick to seat you and take your order, but I find that trying to get the check sometimes can be a hassle. For some reason they are almost ALWAYS facing the other way when I'm trying to grab the check.

The Taiwanese-style pepper steak is 12.95 that comes with a soup, salad, and in the dish itself an egg and noodles as well. There are two options of whether you want the mushroom sauce or the black pepper sauce. I opted for the black pepper sauce. The server also ask the type of sauce and degree of wellness on the steak.  The dish comes out on a hot plate making it sizzle and the aroma spreading in the air quickly. The portion is really filling, I even took half of it home with me. I loved the black pepper sauce! I have had various black pepper sauces from California to Las Vegas,  and this was one definitely in my top 5 better tasting black pepper sauces. May wonder what may be difference since it is black pepper, but the technique can either make it turn super spicy, mild, or no flavor/bland. In this case it was just right. A mild black pepper sauce. The steak was cooked correctly as I had ordered it.   Since it is a boba place, must get a drink! I ordered the large tapioca milk tea and they give a lot of boba in your drink for its worth! They have honey boba which makes it have a nice after taste in your mouth. The texture was a little chewier than what I prefer, but it is more of a preference thing. The portion is decent and worth the money of 4 dollars.  Also tried the snow ice here! The snow ice came in a heart-shaped bowl that was decorated with mango, kiwi, and strawberries making it quite appealing to the eye. The snow ice had a nice mango taste to it.

I once wrote a good review for this place but my last experience was so not enjoyable and I left pissed off that I wish I could give 0 stars. I just read someone else's review saying they give 10% off discount for people who show them there yelp account. I wish I knew that before hand. Either way, I think they should treat ever customer like they matter, or like they are important, customer service is a very big thing in my opinion, when I worked for my mothers restaurant in Austin TX. I treated every customer like they where important, and was always professional even when a customer got pissed off and cursed @ me, I always kept cool and stayed professional cause thats what your suppose to do. I think sometimes the customers got even more mad (the ones who where cursing) cause they couldn't piss me off, but in all reality cursing @ the one who is trying to help you is not going to fix the problem, say if a order was wrong, or late, cursing @ the customer is not going to fix anything, N I thought if I stayed cool maybe they could cool down so we could fix the problem, get a discount, next order free etc. Anyway, I went the Icy Juicy to meet up with my webmaster, cause I was coming out with my personal website for my modeling/acting business, and was trying to find a credit card server for my website.  I did not get anything done this meeting with my webmaster, why? Cause the music was to loud and I could not hear anything, I asked them to turn the volume down, maybe it was the TV or the music, either way, the volume did not go down, I was on the phone with someone, and could not even really hear what that person I was speaking to on the phone with was saying, I kept plugging my other ear so I could hear them better when I was inside the store, that should have given the hint to the waitress that the volume was still way to loud, but I guess they are stupid and cant figure it out. I will never come back here, especially not for business. Maybe come here if your not doing anything important to you, or if your not trying to read something important, I don't see why places like this have internet if they are going to have the music/TV so loud you can not focus on whatever your doing. If you ask me music should be low and pleasant in the back ground, not pounding loud & annoying in your ears. I felt like my head was pounding off, and the waitress not turning it down even tho I requested that pissed me off even more. This may have been my last meeting with my webmaster for a while now, cause I am moving to LA June 1st, and today is May 29th now, I went in there May 28th. N MY webmaster comes to La every month but it still may be a month before my next meeting with my webmaster. The only reason I left a tip was cause the webmaster I was with wanted to leave a tip but if it was up to me, I would not have left a tip. The waitress told me good bye when I walked out the door, but I was going to walk out the door and not say anything to them, to let them know I was pissed. N trust me when I say I was not just a little pissed. I was totally pissed off. 101% or more. They do have big drinks there but I didn't come there for the drinks, I came there to do business and I got nothing done, cause I couldn't read and focus, or soak in what I was reading or what the person I was speaking on the phone to was saying. N it was hard to pay attention to what the webmaster was saying with all that loudness going on. Goodbye Icy Juice I will not miss your loud music, or your bad customer service ignoring my request when I asked you to turn the volume down. I'm a business minded person and almost never come out unless it's for business, n since I could not do business here there is no reason for me to come back.

I have yet to order a fruit smoothie, I'd assume they use real fruit and not bs you like most boba places with syrup. However, my awesome experience for this place comes from the Taiwanese snow. This is so far the best place in Vegas to get Taiwanese snow. Although the menu is confusing to read, they actually have a wide and diverse selection on flavors of snow! They also top your snow with mochi and condensed milk without asking for it (this may be bad for others but mochi and condensed milk are a must for me!). The fruits in my snow were sweet and perfectly ripened. The snow and condensed milk worked together and had a nice gooey and flakey consistency. All in all, the snow was perfect!  I don't dig the crowd here too much. Maybe its just me, but I get a little uncomfortable being surrounded by fobs. Most the employees look fobby too... lol. However, these fobs have good customer service. I came in twice so far and was instantly greeted every time and served with a smile.

It wasn't our first time as I've tried this place a few times before our last unfortunate visit in May. The service is just fine and the food was pretty good. I've especially enjoyed the popcorn chicken and milk teas with boba... and then while my friend was pleasantly sucking up the tapioca pearls in her boba, she happened to see legs protruding out of out of the black pearls. Looking closer and separating that  interesting  piece of boba, we came to a realization that it was a COCKROACH.   My friend went back to the counter to ask for a refund, and they did refund her, which was nice. A few of us also expressed our desire to also get refunds (which they denied, because they reasoned we drank most of our drink anyway), and as I'm sure her boba came from the same container as ours did and I don't want to drink something where I know there was a way for cockroaches to sneak in the tapioca pearl container. Cockroaches are attracted to sugar water, which is what they probably soak the tapioca pearls in to make it sweet.   Now I wish we had taken a picture and sent it to the health department, but we didn't think about it at the time. I originally wasn't going to post this, but I think that everyone has a RIGHT TO KNOW about our experience there.

It took 3 people to ring up my order, apparently there was some confusion on how to properly charge me for boba in my honeydew milk tea. Or maybe there was a language barrier. I don't know, but the ordering process certainly could have been smoother.   Total came to $5.68. The waitress didn't say anything to me after I paid... so I stood there for a few minutes, feeling awkward and in the way. After a couple minutes I decided to sit down, wondering what the deal was.  A full ten minutes later my drink was ready. It tasted gritty, likely due to the instant creamer used. The cup had a normal lid, not the fancy seal I have come to expect from boba tea shops.

I wasn't looking to eat a full-on meal, but was looking forward to dessert instead, so I just had the sald/pepper chicken.

Since it's close by, convenient, and open late, I like to go here with my friends to catch up. Although the staff isn't super attentive, they give us the basics, and don't tell us to leave even when we stay for long periods of time (that's a huge plus in my book!). The food itself is satisfactory as well. I used to work around the area, so I would go from time to time on my lunch break. It was filling, and I felt that I got my money's worth. (The crispy chicken is super yummy here, btw. Get the meal version, and it's pretty bomb. Get the regular version to share with your friends, which is pretty good, too.) As for the negative side of my experiences there, the biggest thing for me is the smell. There is a strong sewage smell that seems to permeate the place, and people are forever smoking RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR, which is open half the time.  If you're seated close to the entrance, it smells like cigarette and sewage. If you're fortunate to be seated towards the back, you just get the sewage smell. Sometimes it gets quite crowded and noisy, but that seems to come with the territory of that plaza. Parking isn't always easy to find, either, especially if you're going on a more popular night.

Yesterday (12/3), I tried their   Taro Milk Tea: got it hot, really creamy and full of flavor but not overly sweet  Pinenuts Milk Tea: pinenuts were not really my thing, but the milk tea was great. It's not the traditional Taiwanese milk tea. It's made with either English Breakfast or some other kind of black tea that I couldn't completely identify, not with red tea. So if you're expecting red tea, don't.   Today, I went in to try some other drinks and their food. I got their house special. It's the 6th page in their menu. You can choose from Juicy Steak, Chicken Steak Cutlet, Fish Fillet Steak, or Sizzling Noodle. All of them come on a sizzling platter, which has a cool feeling when it comes out of the kitchen to your table in this chic ambience, light gray-blue walls, with glass art, print art, and tea sets decorating different cities' names in their bar area.   In Chinese, it says you can choose either mushroom sauce or black pepper sauce on the right side, next to the prices of House Special. This is for you non-Chinese reading people. Below that, you see  Soup/Sala/French Fries/Toast  and  Sala  is NOT a typo. That's what it says. I'm sure you can figure out what word that is. Anyway, I chose the  Chicken Steak Cutlet with Mushroom Sauce: Chicken was so tender, mushroom sauce was an on-the-sweeter-side tomato sauce with canned mushrooms, and the pasta that came on top swirled into the sauce was al dente. It was a great meal for a cheap price.  Salad: iceberg, came with a package of ranch on the side  Fries: one of the BEST order of fries I have ever had, so crispy and came with a garlic sauce  They're also having a promotion right now until the 7th. If you check in on Facebook, you receive 50% off. I did that yesterday and today. :) Yummy food at half off... service is the typical Chinatown service you would get at most places, so I can't complain too much there. They try to take things away a little earlier than you'd like, but that's the eager beaver in them, right?   I would say their drinks are a bit better than Miss, definitely five stars.

I think I'll try the mixed fruit one next time for more fruit variety and go light on the condensed milk.  Definitely a hole on the wall, hidden in a strip mall. Just get past the cigarette butt infested outside and it'll be ok. We will definitely come back to try more!", "Date": "2014-10-25", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "jovan", "ReviewID": "0gFGyOYOn_v601E_wumn6A", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Food and Milk tea is good; but the shitty costumer service and bitchy waitress in the front?

The drink variety is there, the taste is there, and place to be with a group of friends is there. The only thing that totally kills it for me is the service and the people who work there. If your whole group of friends all don't order something, you're going to hear an old Chinese guy insult you in Chinese behind you in a tone that tries to be subtle but fails.   For drinks, it tastes good! I like the drinks on the menu. When I asked for water after my smoothie, I got a tiny little cup filled with warm water, no ice, no straw. I didn't get a whole refill for I'd say and hour and a half? I even requested it from the waitresses for a refill.   The staff is a buzzkill.  Wat u want to orduh.  Is the first thing they said to us. Oh and in a Fobby Chinese angry tone. I have nothing against Fobby Chinese accent because my family is basically all from Asia, but at least be Fobby nice to customers. Maybe  o hallo how u do today? Duh weaduh is duh nice day for duh boba drink ya? Enjoy you drinks hokay?    Anyways, our group was about 10ish people? Everyone was dissatisfied with the place and it just made us all angry. Mood killer. We ended up going to fresh cup right across the street and that is a much better choice for boba and other things !", "Date": "2013-08-20", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Cat", "ReviewID": "wr3-2vrsvX3MAA_so7ylKw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "A nice place to chill out between errands.

They didn't know what add ons were available on the menu. Regardless, we got the following:  Papaya coconut milk: Fresh/frozen papaya which is nice instead of the syrup. It tasted quite good, though the papaya taste was a bit faint. Good idea though.  Milk tea: Normal, but it was actually quite delicious. Your average, light, milk tea.  Green tea no sugar with pudding and grass jelly: Green tea was normal green tea...no floral scents/jasmine in it. It was pretty average and nothing special. Grass jelly didn't have much flavor, but my real complaint was the PUDDING. I honestly felt like they mixed up the sugar with CHALK. The consistency was chalky/gritty and it was barely sweet! It also was even a bit SALTY! It was so bad that I had to ask them to make me another drink without the pudding! DO NOT GET THE PUDDING.  Anyway, overall I'd still rather go to tea station. The tea is much better and so are the toppings.", "Date": "2011-12-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "A", "ReviewID": "rgNoN_uMWt5U30Lhe0Nnkw", "Overall": "3", "Content": "prices are cheaper than tea planet/ station  It was a clean environment.", "Date": "2011-12-27", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "AJ", "ReviewID": "_NTPOvtI5c-hBT_uo2k2vg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "One of my top 5 places to get boba in Vegas.
