VELVET. PANCAKES (although here they call them  babystacks. ) I'm so in love with them my heart is breaking from being apart. I've always liked red velvet cupcakes/cakes, but cluelessly had never thought of it being made into different forms of carb goodness.   Baby Stacks is a normal looking breakfast joint in a normal looking shopping mall, but what lurks inside is NOT normal. The food here has a bit of a Hawaiian influence that results in an AWESOME party in your mouth ;)   We each ordered from the  Breakfast Favorites.  The hub had the  bacon and eggs  and chose hash browns and buttermilk babystacks. I had their  Portuguese sausage and eggs  and chose rice and their specialty RED. VELVET. BABYSTACKS. The hub said his breakfast was good, but you can get what he ordered anywhere else that serves breakfast. My order on the other hand was absolutely FANTASTIC! There's no way to describe the joy and utter elation I felt when those red velvet cakes hit my tongue *cue foodgasm noise.* Done deal, 5 stars! As soon as those stacks hit the table I pounced and I pounced hard! Oh man, I can't wait to have them again. They're perfectly done and when you add the cream cheese icing/syrup with the gorgeously whipped cream, it's utter food heaven.   So, what have we learned? Don't come here for a  normal  breakfast and get here fast because this place fills up quick!

The wait for that size group on that Sunday morning was 30 minutes. since it was plenty of time for our 2 stragglers to show up before then we put in our name for a table, but those 2 were running a little late. We were brought in and seated and the man hosting who sat us at a table kept asking where the rest of our party was, we insisted they would be arriving shortly. But he kept nagging us about them and spoke to is VERY rudely and with bad attitude and a facial expression to match said to us  You better not get me in trouble  and he walked away. Ewe, he disgusted me and his behavior made me lose my appetite. Even my sister said she'd be happy to walk out of he was going to be a dick about it & Baby Stack's Cafe would lose out on good business and since it was our first time we could have been potential regulars. Instead we called the pair and asked them not to show up because the. Man hosting couldn't wait another 5 minutes before acting like an asshole towards us.   Our sever (I wish I heard her name) was super sweet. She was so nice with such a pleasant attitude and very accommodating.    The food was yummy, good enough to redeem the poor behavior we had endured from the douche of a host, but still I wish we didn't have to encounter that man before trying to enjoy a nice Sunday breakfast with my family and our blessing babies and toddlers.   I ordered the honey French toast but it didn't come with anything g other than the two slices of toast so I had to order a side of breakfast potatoes. The French toast was great, I appreciate non-soggy toast since I'm extremely picky of food textures. I also decided I wanted to try the sweet cream crepe and it wasn't anything special, still tasty, but maybe if I had order extra topping for an extra charge I might had been more impressed.   A couple people in our party tried the red velvet pancakes and swear it was the most delicious pancakes they have ever tried, it was so good they had a hard time trying to explain to me just how great it was, all they could say was  it was amazing .", "Date": "2015-05-26", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Patrick", "ReviewID": "S9oaPwzxP_ncLvtnnMeBwQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Great place for breakfast! Brother and I ordered red velvet pancakes, Portuguese sausage, scramble eggs, hash brown (extra crispy), and cinnabun pancakes.  Red velvet was perfect: not too thick on the flavor and not too light, fluffy in the middle. Comes with icing and whipped butter which complemented perfectly. Highly recommend.  Cinnabun pancakes were very sweet and tasted like a donut. If you like sweet pancakes, this is your pancake.  Portuguese sausage were on point: nice flavor and goes well with eggs and hash brown.

Yeah, I think I went a bit overboard, but it's okay. I can always start dieting tomorrow.   Red velvet pancakes- 5 stars. I still drool thinking about this pancake, because it's like eating cake but in pancake form. The texture is more like a muffin cake rather than a chewy pancake, but it's SOOO GOOOOOOOOOOD. For a sweet tooth like myself, this is heavenly.   Adobo fried rice omelet - 4 stars. The flavoring inside with the rice and adobo is good. I think it could have been a bit saltier, and I think I'd enjoy it more as a fried rice rather than in an omelet since the egg outside dilutes the saltiness inside, making it a bit bland for my taste. I was confused if I'm supposed to put ketchup outside and eat it or should it have been tonkatsu sauce? Maybe that would be more genius.   Side of portugese sausage- 4 stars. Who don't like sausage? OINK OINK. My belly does. I'm no Portuguese sausage connoisseur, but I love a fatty polska kielbasa and this sausage did the job.   Some healthy bacon and all kinds of stuff omelet with avocado on top- 4 stars. I never order omelets at restaurants, because I can make a pretty legit version in my own kitchen. SO, I don't know what to say and how to rate this omelet. It was good, but not something I'd order.   I'm coming back for VELVET PANCAKES!!! WOOOOOO!  Service- 7/5 stars. It's off the charts.

I ordered the banana pancakes (forgive me I'm not really much of a risk taker when it comes to pancakes) with turkey sausage and eggs with, get this, pepper jack cheese. I was surprised they even had pepper jack cheese so thats another bonus in my book :) I dont't know if my friends and I were just super hungry or they really were taking awhile but the food eventually came to the table.   Im from Los Angeles and here we have a small restaurant chain called Pann's were the pancakes are just YUM! After visiting Baby Stacks I feel they need a new recipe lol. The turkey sausage was good along with the eggs. Although I'm not a huge egg fan i felt they could have shown a little more love (given me more eggs) for my side.

Babystacks is a good option if you have a car and want to get away from the Strip for a second.  I came here after one such night in Vegas last month, and a delicious fusion brunch was exactly what I needed.  The wait for our party of five wasn't too long, only about 20 minutes or so (compared to our epic wait the night before at Bachannal, this was easy peasy).    I ordered the adobo fried rice, which comes out wrapped in an omelette.  The dish normally comes out with macaroni salad, but they let me change it out for the breakfast potatoes.  I liked the fried rice, but honestly I thought the entire dish was a little dry.  The breakfast potatoes were lightly fried and cubed, so it was hard to go wrong with these.    Since there were a few of us, I was lucky to try some other things too.  The loco moco was amazing, hands-down the best dish we had at the table.  The sauce was on point and the beef was so good, especially for the hungover.  The Kalua pig benedict was good, although not super impressive.  While everyone at the table raved about the white chocolate macadamia nut and red velvet pancakes, I personally thought they were both a bit dry.  Of course, you can dunk the red velvet in the cream cheese dressing on the side, but that's just a bit too sweet for me.  Maybe it's because I'm not really a sweet tooth, but I'd come back for the loco moco.  Service:  Pleasant and friendly.  Ma-and-pa local run kind of place.  Bottom line:  You know those dishes where you try a bite of your friend's and you wish you had ordered that dish?  Loco moco.  No regrets.

The name is BabyStacks Cafe, so you can assume that they specialize in pancakes, and specialize they do! The front page of their menu has a list of different kinds of pancakes they serve. The red velvet is supposedly the most popular, and it is delicious, but my favorite is the cinnabun personally. I personally wouldn't recommend ordering plain pancakes here since they have so many different specialties, but if that's something you like, I don't think that'd be a bad decision either.   I usually order a skillet or omelette with a side of pancakes. It cost more to order specialty pancakes with your omelette or skillet, but you get the best of both worlds that way. I treat the pancakes like a dessert/side dish kind of thing because most of the pancakes are sweet. You get the main dish with eggs, meat, and maybe potatoes and then you have the pancakes on the side that that is just the perfect combination!  On the weekends, it gets kind of busy, so expect a wait unless you go fairly early and the service can be slow at times, but you can't expect every place to be overstaffed with people waiting to serve you when you come in. They do the best job they can. I remember I came here with many of my family members and we didn't get one of our orders of pancakes and they have us a free short stack of a random specialty pancake. I'm glad they made it up to us for not bringing our order in time because that showed me how much they care about their customer service.

It's a ways from The Strip so don't think it's a quick stop but it's a definite must-try. The Cafe seems like it's Filipino, ergo Adobo Fried Rice, with American and Hawaiian influence.  Red Velvet Pancakes -- Fluffy red pancakes topped with chocolate chips and whipped cream. It's served with their absolutely delicious cream cheese syrup so you can flavor to taste. Typically, I get the pancakes without whipped cream. IMO, everything is perfectly sweet without it. The cream cheese syrup is to die for. It's a perfect pairing with the semi-sweet red velvet pancakes.   Rick's Adobo Fried Rice -- Shredded chicken with rice wrapped inside an egg and green onions. Simply incredible. The saltiness of the chicken was just right. Add some hot sauce (Cholula or Sriracha) to give it a kick. It's a hearty portion but it's so dang good I usually finish most of it in one sitting. It also comes with a side of mac salad. You can hardly taste the mayo. Probably one of my favorite versions of mac salad to date.   Service has always been on point.

So, an updated review was in need.   Whether you're local or visiting, you have to try Babystacks at least once.  My opinion, still one of the best breakfast joints in town.  You can still get your eggs, bacon, and hash browns at BabyStacks.  But let's be honest, it's all about their stacks.  You can't go wrong with most of their pancakes and it's their Red Velvet that they're known for. Other favorites for me include their Portuguese Sausage, Loco Moco (IKR?), Garlic Rice, Biscuits/Gravy, Macadamia Stack, and their Adobo Fried Rice.   Regarding this specific location, I have to say it's the best one to go to if you're looking for less of a wait and a bigger location.  At this location, you're almost seated immediately.  However, I still think the North Buffalo location is better.  Maybe I'm biased, maybe I'm just loyal, but I think the food taste just a tad better at the north location. But please, continue to go the south location so that I don't have to wait as long at the north one.   TIP:  On my most recent visit, I did something that I never do. I got a full stack of their Red Velvet pancakes. A short stack is usually good enough, especially if you're just complimenting a main dish.  I don't believe in wasting food so I cleaned my plate.

The many Hawaiian influenced plates are some of the best, though they are obviously well known for pancakes. I tried the Kalua Benedict with a short stack of banana cream panacakes. Pancakes were lovely and hit the spot. The benedict was tasty, larticularly with the smoked pulled pork. However, my hollandaise had the same typical taste and texture you would find at any cheap breakfast joint (as if it came out of a jar), and the poached eggs were overcooked. The yolk did not run at all which is a sin when serving benedict or even just poached eggs. It showed a lack of detail and commitment to the food they serve. It seems a shame as they clearly have some nice plates and flavors but without the execution you are only just slightly better than an ihop or dennys.

But enough of this.  This is a pancake joint, so let's talk about those.  The bacon pancakes were very good.  They had bacon in them, and on them.  They were springy and resilient without being tough.  Not too soft or hard, but just about perfect.  They were flavorful, and very tasty.    The service was good.  The waitress pleasant.  Everything was pretty quick.  The cost was decent.  Were I a local, I'd probably come here often.

The syrup was unnecessary since the pancakes are already too sweet on their own. I finished two of the six and was done. My friend was insistent on getting a half order of pb & chocolate chip pancakes and a eggs and sausage plate. The pancakes are heavy and the savory items are just average.

They have alot of the traditional breakfast fare, but they also have a bunch of hawaiian/asian food options as well.  We checked out of course what everyone gets: the red velvet pancakes! and the white chocolate macadamia pancakes! These things are more of a dessert rather than a actual dish, pure sugary sweetness. I liked the white chocolate ones but my friends thought they were waaay to sweet. But I think they jus have poor taste. the Red Velvet ones were exactly that, red dyed pancakes, with a interesting cream cheese syrup which sounded out but worked out well. I liked the red velvet, they were good, but I don't think they live up to the immense hype that I heard of.  We also ordered another dish, I think Huevos Rancheros or something, but it was obviously forgettable. To be honest, the place is my opinion is good, but it's not as amazing as everyone else makes to seem.

Take note ! They only seat after ENTIRE party is there. And they get pretty busy during breakfast or lunch time (only open for breakfast and lunch, for obvious reasons)  Been here a few times. Various friends and family. So got to try different things.   Like a normal breakfast place, they offer a variety Omelettes, pancakes, etc. They have a slight Hawaiian influence so you'll see things like kalua pork, or bbq pork, or Portuguese sausage on the menu.But the most talked about, and hyped, is their Red Velvet Pancakes. For those who dont know, red velvet is more known for the cake. Bright to dark red cake flavored with cocoa with a cream cheese icing, So essentially, simply a chocolate cake, without the overload of chocolate.   My first time here, was with one other friend. We had tried the red velvet, as well as the banana cream pancake. Prior to this, i had been very sick of pancakes because one year, my friends and I decided to go around to different iHops on international pancake day, and eat free pancakes.... that killed it for me for a few years. So traditional normal pancakes, definitely a no go for me ! I was eager to try these new pancakes with different flavors though.   At BabyStacks, they offer their pancakes in full stacks or half stacks, and their pancakes are smaller than the normal ones you see.  Maybe like 4-5  in diameter vs the plate sized ones.   Red Velvet Pancakes - As said before, its red, but essentially a lighter chocolate pancake with cream cheese icing and whipped cream. Its pretty good. Not what it was hyped up to be (maybe im not much of a dessert person anyway) but its not bad. I still do recommend people who hasn't tried it, to try it. Light chocolatey flavor with a not too heavy cream cheese icing.   Banana Cream Pie Pancake - Traditional pancake with what you'd find in a banana cream pie so sliced bananas, a banana cream, and whipped cream. The first time i tried it, it was surprisingly amazing, Originally being a lover of banana cream pie (to the extent of not being a dessert lover... if that makes sense), this had sparked my interest in pancakes again.

The 2 egg special wasn't too special I thought. The potatoes as well as the toast  look and tasted like something you can get anywhere.   The adobo fried rice in the egg wrap lacked a bit of salt but was quite good with a touch of hot sauce. Oh yeah, you know this place is Asian owned because they give you some choices of hot sauce in advance before you get your food.  It's tasty but I did wish the fried rice wasn't nearly as soggy.   The S'mores pancakes are just regular pancakes with marshmallows, choco chips, and regular syrup. It was good but not excellent good.   We also got the Kalua Pork benedict. The Kalua pork was juicy, smokey, and so good! I did wish the eggs were hotter and more runnier. I am picky about my benedicts but together, they were still really good.   But the best thing we got undoubtedly was the red velvet pancakes. Slightly crisp on the outside with a dollop of cream and the cream cheese syrup on top. The syrup DOES make the pancakes come alive!  By the bathroom, it shows how the owner wanted to make cupcake flavors into pancakes. I have to say, she did a wonderful job transforming it. Babystacks are regarded as one of 50 US must try pancake locations. I totally would agree with this statement. They have locations in San Diego and Las Vegas.

Combine that with a sunny side egg... ono.  Cornbeef hash - this was ok.  Just a plain ground cornbeef hash patty with rice and eggs.  Not too spicy but could have been burned just a little bit longer on the skillet.  Service was good and seating was faster than quoted.  Also noticed the tables were promptly cleaned after someone leaves.

Pancakes are not hard to make but the creativity that baby stacks has come up with forced me to order them, lol!  We had the velvet pancakes, banana cream pie pancakes and the corned beef hash.    red velvet pancakes: they were good, not spectacular like most people here say, but definitely good.  They came with a cream cheese sauce and I noticed most people were pouring the entire thing on their pancakes, lol.  Yeah, they were good but all of it was too sweet for me.   The banana cream pie pancakes were really good.  banana slices, a banana type sauce, almonds and a whipped cream that tasted like it was infused with banana.  If they only added some chocolate too! mmmm.........  The corned beef hash said that it was homemade on the menu but it looked like and tasted like the canned stuff.  I think the best corned beef hash still belongs to Black Bear Diner...  Overall a great experience and we will be back.  We're looking forward to trying the kalua pig benedict, chicken adobo omelet, etc.    p.s. for any Hawaii Peeps out there, their banana cream pie pancakes tasted exactly like the banana mac pancakes from BOOTS N KIMOS in Kailua!

The Kailua pig Benedict's sounded great, but I was eventually grateful they don't give you much pig. Pretty flavorless. This last time I tried the chili loco moco special. Horrible!

Their extensive menu is mostly geared towards breakfast food, with just one page dedicated to their lunch menu. At first I thought it was just your regular American type of Breakfast and Brunch place, but they also have Hawaiian plates such as Loco Moco and Spam Scramble. Apparently they're known for their pancakes, or  BabyStacks . There was such a huge variety that I felt pretty overwhelmed. I wanted to try everything! Thanks to Yelp, I just had to order the Red Velvet short stack. Seriously, this was pretty much a dessert party in my mouth! Probably one of the best Red Velvet pancakes I've had. The pancakes had whipped cream, chocolate crumbles, and this amazing cream cheese syrup. It was amazing!

Not only is it my favorite meal of the day, but I almost always have to get a savory item AND a sweet item. Wifey kept it simple and ordered Cheesy scrambled eggs and hash browns with an upgrade of Rocky Road pancakes. I had the Adobo Fried Rice Omelette, substituted the macaroni salad (but still got it anyway) and  upgraded to their famous Red Velvet Pancakes. I love banana pancakes and banana cream pie, so  I had to try their banana cream pie pancakes as well.  I KINDA SORTA FORGOT two important words though.......  Short Stack.........DOH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Must've been a sign of hunger!)  I killed my omelette and  we both preferred the Red velvet pancakes as the rocky road ones sounded better than it tasted. Out came the Banana Cream Pie Pancakes, and that plate of 6(or was it 8???) pancakes was enough for 2-3 people! I dug in and wow! were they good! It felt like I was eating dessert for breakfast. I also kinda wish they would've toasted the almonds for added flavor though, just sprinkling them on raw didn't do any justice.  Anywho, although I didn't kill it, I did some serious damage leaving just one pancake  left.  Whoa!, you really put a dent in those pancakes!  A table next to us said... Are you a competitve eater?   No, but I did have 80 pieces of sushi in one sitting, and put away a 12 scoop bucket of ice cream with the works in an hour.  I replied........ALOHA!!!

When I got a text from my friend last night before that they were going to Babystacks for brunch, I jumped on the moment to tag along.  Boy am I glad I did!  ***Please be advised that you may have to wait a while before you get a table.  The hostess advised me that it could be upwards of up to 45 minutes.  We ended up waiting a little over 30 minutes.  Speaking of the hostess, I would like to share the only reason why this place got 4 stars for me.  This morning, there was a young girl in the front, taking everyone's name for the list.  She was definitely not as pleasant as I hoped for.  Maybe it just wasn't her day.  She showed a lot of irritation and no patience for anyone in front of her.  When it was time to pay, I noticed a jar that said,  Tip for hostess,  and realized why there was only a SINGLE dollar in there...  Ok, I'm done with my negative rant.  I want to talk about the AH-MAZE-ING food known as Babystacks!  Here's what me and my friends got:  Spam and Eggs for $8.25- It came with 3 slices of fried spam, eggs the way you like it (I got it scrambled) and either potatoes, hash browns, garlic rice for an extra charge and pancakes (any kinds of specialty pancakes for an up charge as well).  I chose the garlic rice and the bacon pancakes to get a versatile meal.  The rice was regular white rice with some kind of garlic infused oil drizzle over it with onions.  The only suggestion we had was maybe having caramelized onions in the future, but the rice was good.  The eggs were eggs and so was the spam.  Here's where this dish blows your minds...WHEN YOU COMBINED THOSE FLAVORS IN ONE BITE! That combination in one bite just made this dish worth it for me.  The pancakes were buttermilk pancakes with strips of bacon in the batter.  I really love eating breakfast meat with maple syrup so having that bacon in the pancakes made it AMAZEBALLS for me!!  Kalua Pig Benedict for $9.75- Now this is the dish that will keep me coming back!!  Let's start with the most flavorful seasoned potatoes cut into small cubes.  Then my friends, then there's the main attraction!  Toasted English Muffin, layered with a smoked Kalua (shredded) pig with cabbage, a medium poached egg and topped with hollandaise sauce.  I can't tell you how AH-MAZE-ING this dish is.  You'll just have to try it yourself.  Just know that the pork is super juicy and smokey, the English muffin is toasted by still soft, the egg is perfectly poached and the hollandaise is...well, let's just say that I'm going to dream about that sauce for months to come.  My friend had the short stack of Red Velvet Pancakes for $5.75- Start with 3 red velvet pancakes, topped with chocolate chunks and whipped cream and served with a cream cheese syrup.  I had the opportunity to try this and boy was it good!!  Super moist, super flavorful and such a great concept/reality!  I will be ordering a full stack the next time.  My other friend got the Portuguese sausage and eggs for $8.95- He had his eggs over easy, got the hashbrowns and chose the banana cream pie pancakes for an extra charge.  The Portuguese sausage is very familiar to me, being from Hawaii and it looked like the eggs were perfectly cooked.  Although I didn't try his meal, I know he was very satisfied by it, especially the banana cream pie pancakes.  His pancakes had bananas in the batter and as a topping.  These pancakes also came with sliced almonds, whipped cream, crushed pie crust and drizzled with a banana cream sauce.    The place is small.  Super small.  There's a t.v. in the joint, contains bar top seating and a couple of butterflies as it's decor.  I'd consider this place a contender for Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.  The food is that good!  If it wasn't for the hostess with the bad impression, this place would have gotten a 5 star.  Mark my words though.

I had the banana cream pie pancakes and they really tasted like banana cream pie.  If you like banana cream pie, you will love these pancakes.  My friends had carrot cake, cinnabun and bacon pancakes.  They were all well received but the bacon pancakes had a complaint that they were lacking a bit in the bacon department.   I didn't not try them, but they did not look like they were super infused with bacon as they should be.  The only major complaint we had was service.  When we first arrived we asked if they had fresh brewed iced tea and the woman taking our drink order said no.  We saw a pitcher of what looked like iced tea sitting on the counter top.  We asked our waiter when he came to take our order and he said that was indeed iced tea.  Apparently the woman who took our order did not speak english very well.  Hmm...that's a bit problematic.

I've been here on 2 visits and my most recent I ordered something other than my usual selections of kalua pig benedict and red velvet pancakes. They had a dry erase board with new menu selections and it had things like kalua pig grilled cheese and breakfast sliders. Both sounded delish, but after reading the description of the breakfast sliders it seemed like it was something I could make on my own making me choose the kalua pig grilled cheese! Loved every bite of it because it had a good amount of pork in there and meshed well with all the cheesey goodness.

From the looks of the menu, I wanted to order everything.  Being part Filipina from Hawaii, it was refreshing to see the food had that same ethnic vibe.  I ordered the corned beef hash, eggs, & garlic fried rice.  I really didn't like the texture of the corned beef hash.  It was too processed, and like another Yelper noted, reminded me of dog food.  The garlic rice was good, like my mom's.  I also didn't care for the pancakes.  They tasted very strongly of baking powder.  I can't remember what my son ordered but he ate it all without complaints.  My friend, also from Hawaii,  ordered the Loco Moco and ate all of hers.  She ordered a short stack of the red velvet pancakes.  I tried them and again, the taste of baking powder was overpowering.  The cream cheese syrup was good.  My son ate the rest and liked them.

If they weren't so small they may not have the rule of not seating until your whole party is there. I knocked off a star for that.  The crepes are delicious. They have made me a Nutella fan. I have fought for years against it. Then I tried it with strawberries, and then bananas. Both set it off nicely.  The rest of the menu is varied with some specialty dishes I've never seen. Everyone raves about them, I've had some bites. They are very good, but I'd have to give up a crepe for them, so a bite or two do me just fine.  If you get there before nine there's no wait. After nine you will wait 15 to 20 min.  The waitresses are ok, nothing to scream about. They keep the tasty hood coffee coming, sometimes after a wait of 5 min or so. To me that's unacceptable.

So of course we split the red velvet pancakes, it's like dessert for breakfast. I would recommend getting the short stack and splitting it between the table so everyone get a taste, don't know if I could eat an entire plate b/c it may be just a tad too sweet. The adobo omelette was also shared and that had really good flavor, but my absolute favorite, what I got up early for on my day off was the lemon ricotta pancakes (more like a crepe) sweet baby Jesus these brought tears to my eyes, ok maybe a little dramatic but they are so good I need to emphasize how good. So light and refreshing, I just add a tiny layer of butter and sprinkle powdered sugar and dip a bite at a time in the sauce it comes with.

Warm, comforting, just looking at the menu reminds me of home!  I've eaten at this location recently a few times and I've left feeling happy and full. I really enjoy cafes that only serve breakfast and/or brunch like this one, because they do it right!   If you've ever been to Hawaii and miss those nostalgic eats, like spam, Portuguese sausage, eggs, & rice, Kalua pig Benedict, or some fluffy white-chocolate macadamia nut pancakes, you've found your place that serves all that and more. I haven't tried some of their more creative creations, like their Spam Scramble. Spam, eggs, rice, furikake, with homemade macaroni salad?! Or the Rick's Adobo Fried Rice or classic Loco Moco? It all sounds ono, doesn't it? They also offer omelettes, skillets, burgers, and even Zippy's Chili! If that wasn't enough, their pancakes or babystacks as they call them, are delicious! Classic toppings like blueberry and buttermilk, but their unique flavors like Orange Dreamsicle, rocky road, PB&J, S'mores, Carrot Cake, Banana Cream, even Bacon pancakes are sure to catch your eye. They are most known for their Red Velvet, however the rest of the selections sound just as delicious, I think. Recently, we tried the Cinnabun and Hazelnut w/ Nutella. Light, fluffy, and delicious, as pancakes should be! Their garlic rice, which are sautéed with onions are amazing, which many people substitute for the plain steamed white rice.   Another thing I love is the way BabyStacks lets you substitute anything, some for a small up charge. Garlic rice? Egg whites only? Lemon Ricotta pancakes instead of regular buttermilk? I appreciate restaurants like this that'll make your breakfast the way you want it! And the prices are very reasonable. Their highest priced item I saw was $11.95, and that's for a full breakfast entree, which you get a big portion of meat accompanied with rice or potatoes AND pancakes or toast.    I've had great service on each of my visits. Waters filled, food delivery fast, and servers are friendly and helpful.   Honestly, the only thing that makes this place less than 5 stars is probably the wait to be seated.

I had an egg white omelet with a side of rice instead of hash browns. In addition, I ordered a mini side of chocolate chip pancakes. SO GOOD!  The Bad: It's hard to eat healthy in this type of breakfast place. Most all of the pancakes and breakfast items are for sure going to be high in calories.

Inconsistent dishes, mediocre service, but two of the tastiest breakfast items I've had to date.  Babystacks is know for its fluffy pancakes and its Island inspired breakfast items. Adobo Fried Rice. I don't know what this stuff is made out of, but it's so addictive (so probably crack)! On a previous visit, I overheard a guy ask for the rice as a side and the waitress said, of course. A big pile of fresh adobo fried rice arrived with his order.  On my last trip I asked for just a side of the rice and was denied. Being in a large group and not feeling particularly bratty, I let it slide as a friend said she'd take my eggs and I could have the filling. When the food arrived, the rice was delightful except for how crunchy it was. Starving and because the rice was so damn tasty, i plowed away. I was insatiable. To this day, I still find my self muttering Adobo Fried Rice in my sleep...  The rest of the menu is hit or miss, including the pancakes. Most are simply pancakes with dope toppings, but the pancakes aren't anything spectacular. The most delightful I've had were the Cookies N Creme pancakes. Diabettttus for breakfast, but heavenly.

Efficiency! Time is of the essence in Vegas :)                                            THE SCOOP:  KAHLUA PORK EGGS BENEDICT:  pork was tender and seasoned well.  Not too salty, which is a PLUS in my book.  I asked for hollandaise sauce ON THE SIDE.  You might want to request this too.  B/c once you break the egg yolk it can get pretty rich & heavy.  And if your benedict is drenched in hollandaise sauce too...idk!  Can you say heartburn?  This dish was pretty good.   PORTUGUESE SAUSAGE w/ garlic rice & eggs PLUS your choice pancakes (2 cakes).  This dish is simple, but AWESOME. The garlic rice is good & homey, but NOT ENOUGH (portion size is about 1/2 bowl of rice).  Us Asians like our rice.  Sausage was tasty and plenty.  As for the pancake - i ordered Banana cream Pie.  A bit bland and dull for me.  Like all some of the other reviews say - if you like Banana cream pie...you would like this. However, it was BLAH.  I even ordered CREAM CHEESE syrup on the side.  The syrup wasn't as good as I envisioned it to be.  Tasted more like a sugar glaze w/ a hint of cream cheese.    ADOBO FRIED RICE: Egg omlette w/ pork adobo rice inside. Sounded pretty unique...had to get it (to go).  It was good, but nothing too special.  Meat was tender and well marinated. i would go w/ the Portuguese sausage combo dish rather than this.   SERVICE: friendly waiter.  Food took a LONG time to come out.

The winner of the morning, however, was the lemon ricotta pancakes. They were more like crepes and they were absolutely PERFECT. So light and fresh. We couldn't stop talking about them, or the restaurant in general. So much so that even a month later while having dinner with some family back home, we mentioned the place and my aunt (who isn't visiting Vegas for months) made me send her all the info for BabyStacks so that she could go eat those pancakes during her visit.   Well done, BabyStacks.

Just like most people, we usually stay on the strip.  We get a shuttle from and back to the airport.  We NEVER rent a car.  Cabs can be expensive so we normally spend 95% of our time on the strip.  Now that we have family in Sin City, we are starting to venture out a little bit more, and it's the one of the best Vegas decisions we have ever made.  We were talking with our family about where to go for Sunday Brunch.  We found buffets ranging from $17.95 to $90 per person on the strip.  Then I hopped on the internet and found BabyStacks Cafe.  They have 4 locations in town. We liked the description and headed to the one off of Flamingo blvd on Buffalo Drive.  This restaurant is owned by a woman who dared to ask herself one crazy question:  What would happen if you take cupcake flavors and turn them into pancakes?  The answer, pure AWESOMENESS! We were a party of 4 and waited for about 30 minutes to get our table.  From what I read, this is pretty normal for the restaurant.  The capacity is a little over 50+ people, and the demand is high, so be prepared for a little wait.  Once in the restaurant, we found it to be clean and the service was spot on.  We ordered quickly.  Here is what we decided on:  Red velvet pancakes German chocolate pancakes Lemon Ricotta crepe like pancakes Orange Creamsicle pancakes Bacon pancakes Biscuits and Gravy with sunny side up eggs and hashbrowns Mexican Omelette Egg White Omelette  The menu is full of great sounding cupcake flavored pancakes, as well as traditional favorites.  They even have Hawaiian specialties with pulled pork and spam. If the other dishes are anything close to what we ordered, you can't go wrong.  Every single dish was delicious.  We all shared what we ordered and all any of us could say was,  WOW!   Personally, I thought the red velvet pancakes were the best, but it was so close to call that there really was no clear winner.  I have never raved about breakfast before.  But I just had to write about this place. BabyStacks Cafe is by far the best breakfast I have ever had. Here is the kicker...the total cost for all 4 of us was $70!  We all ate until we were stuffed and every bite was wonderful.  I guarantee that you can't find anything like this on the strip.  I would suggest that if you are on the strip and you don't have a car, Uber, Lyft, or cab-ride it to this restaurant.

The chicken adobo fried rice and garlic rice option for breakfast specials (Sinangag in Filipino) made me and my galpal feel right at home!   I honestly can't believe we waited this long before hitting Babystacks. It's an all-rounder, service and food were both wins! And even better, the lines weren't hauntingly tedious like we dreaded them to be. Took us less than 5 minutes to be seated but don't buy our case as fact. I have a feeling that certain days will be busier than others, seeing as people come in families, not just in pairs/singles.   Due to unavailable table seating (yep, they had to re-arrange tables to accommodate parties of 4-6), we were led to the bar where we tuned in to the morning news. I don't remember us waiting long before we ordered. We were pretty ready to rock & roll and devour! Servings are pretty decent (I'd say large for us, Asians) and we shared the Corned Beef Hash with Sunny Side up Eggs, wheat bread and the savory, buttery Garlic Rice, also known as Sinangag in Filipino.   On top of that, we figured it would be a waste to not try one of their specialty pancakes. As Hazlenut/Nutella lovers, we debated whether to get the Hazlenut pancakes or the more well-known Red Velvet stack. We ended up with the former and beamed as they got to our counter drizzled with nutella, crushed almonds and whipped cream. Holy moly, were they pretty - and I don't know if you could use this word for pancakes - chunky! A whole spoonful would take a while to chew on and swallow without the help of a drink. Milk did the magic. Soon enough, we had to stop before the they filled us up to our throats.

I was treated to breakfast at Babystacks Cafe, partly in thanks to the amount of reviews on yelp.   They were easy to find, being in this town for the first time and not knowing where anything is.

The menu was a very unique concoction of dessert-style pancakes, and Filipino/island style flair. The latter having a special place in my heart, I ordered the  Adobo fried rice omelette . I didn't realize it at first, but it also came with a side of mac salad! My face lit up when our hostess asked if that was alright. It was $9.25, which some may think is a bit on the high end. It was entirely worth it. Out food came out in under 15 minutes. The portions were rather generous, about an 8 x3  omelette and a deceivingly deep side dish of mac salad. The amount of food is enough to satiate any appetite, and have later as a fourth meal. I'm admittedly picky when it comes to mac salad, and was delighted when I took my first bite of it. It wasn't the least bit runny and wasn't overpowered by mayo. If I could have ordered a pint (I'm from out of town) I definitely would have. The omelette itself was not disappointing in the slightest. The egg was reasonably seasoned, and garnished with green peppers. The fried rice/chicken adobo filling was just what I was craving. If you're not used to adobo, you may find the taste of vinegar unexpected! It had a wonderfully bold taste. The chicken was obviously well soaked, it was very tender and well shredded.

As soon as we grabbed our rent a car this past weekend, we came here.  It was around 10am and the wait was about 15 min.  But hey, it was a Sunday and anywhere breakfast spot it going to be busy.    I ordered the macadamia nut white chocolate pancakes and a side of bacon.  The pancakes come in a reg stack which is 6 or a short stack which is 3.  The three is plenty for me and I usually can only eat two. The pancakes are full of macadamia nuts and sprinkled with mini white choco chips.The side of bacon is three nice, crispy, thick pieces that aren't greasy.  Just thinking about this is making for hungry.  My bf ordered the red Velvet pancakes the first time we went and they were pretty good.  He loved them, but I'm not the biggest fan of red velvet.  This time around he ordered the corn beef hash, which hash browns, and he upgraded his pancakes to the Almond Joy ones.  Man those pancakes were so yummy.  Chocolate pancakes with a ton of coconut in them.  Who wouldn't love those?

Customer service needs work.   I was really excited to try out Babystacks for the first time and it all started out looking good. They had a good selection of pancakes and it was so hard for me to decide which one I wanted, especially since they don't come with any meat. We ended up going with an entree and upgrading our side to a baby stack so that we could try out some flavors.   The adobo omelette was tasty and a good sized portion. The red velvet pancakes we got as it's side was also really yummy.  They were moist and the cream cheese syrup wasn't overly sweet. All in all we were very pleased.   Now our second entree was ordered later (since I couldn't decide what I wanted) and ended up coming out just as we finished our first dish. We were severely disappointed this time around.   The chocolate chip macadamia nut pancakes were alright...they didn't taste too bad, but they were pretty dry. The two pancakes instantly soaked up all the syrup we poured on them and texture was dry, sticky, and all wrong. Not enjoyable at all, but at least they didn't taste disgusting.   Then came the baby chick skillet. The eggs we ordered over easy were cooked perfectly, but the entire dish lacked flavor. The chicken was microscopic because we literally found one piece that was smaller than the potato cubes. And to top it off, I found a piece of hard packaging plastic in my second bite.   We stopped eating and brought it to our waitress's attention. She took the plate back and somebody else came out to talk to us about it. This lady inquired about where we found the plastic and when we told her, she  said that was weird because everything in the dish is freshly made and not packaged. That's exactly what I thought, but there is no excuse for foreign objects to be found in food and it wasn't cool how accusingly she spoke to us, as if we were the ones who put it there.   Then they tried to give us a 20% discount on the meal instead of taking the skillet off the tab completely. This was very upsetting considering we only had three bites in all and left the rest of the dish untouched (including that tiny piece of chicken that was only found after thorough inspection). It was only after my boyfriend insisted they take the skillet off that they proceeded to do so. We still tipped our waitress $5, but I left extremely unhappy about how they handled the whole situation.", "Date": "2014-06-05", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Phung", "ReviewID": "f3bLnlED__4CvO3n_ZCpYg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I wanted to try their red velvet pancakes a few years back but never got the chance to.

If you're looking for a great breakfast/brunch I suggest opting out for the skillets! They have so many combinations and possibilities for them. They also come with pancakes that you can replace with special pancakes for only ONE DOLLAH! I know that everyone talks about their Red Velvet pancakes, but I'm not a huge fan of chocolatey goodness first thing in the morning (ironic I know). Instead, I am in love with their CARROT PANCAKES! Give them a chance! They are delish! I always ask for the cream-cheese syrup on the side. They are fluffy and cooked to absolute perfection. Their BANANA CREAM pancakes are also delicious!

So where else do I turn to but my yelp app. Thanks people of yelp for steering me and my boyfriend to this neat local spot! I was seriously delighted by the selections and the portions are just right. They have red velvet pancakes, lemon ricotta pancakes, honey wheat, and even strawberry shortcake. I ordered the Portuguese sausage and eggs with a short stack of bacon pancakes (A slight increase in price for the upgrade, totally worth it.). And my boo ordered the regular sausage and eggs with the banana cream pancakes. He and I both agreed Portuguese is the best way to go because the sausage had a little spice to it that the other sausage could not compete with.

I tried the limited edition Chocolate Peppermint Pancakes, which were tasty for the first three bites then were too sweet.

The wide variety of food at BabyStacks is a little overwhelming, but I guess you could say they have something for everyone.

The panacea of pancakes changes often, but expect to find staples like Red Velvet, Lemon-Ricotta, and S'mores on the menu when you dine.  Besides lots of pancakes, BabyStacks also stays true to it's Hawaiian roots with breakfast grinds like Loco Moco, Spam fried rice, and Kahlua Pork omelets.     The place is very small, and can feel cramped, especially during a busy weekend rush.  If you don't have the sweet tooth of a five year old, you may want to pass on the pancakes, and go for something savory.

The party of 20 that came in before us wiped out the kitchen service as there were only TWO cooks that day. We waited over 45 minutes for our food and by the time the food came, everyone was extremely upset. Our server DID notify us 25 minutes into the wait that they were short on staff in the kitchen. But he never checked on us before or after that notification. We should've left after that, but since we saw the food coming out for the party of 20, we waited. Still, we waited a LONG time after.

We also ordered the White chocolate macadamia nut pancakes! This was a little overkill for me since I'm not a big pancake or sweets guy.

Greeted very warmly when we walked in and immediately were shown to our table.  Overall: I'd come here again to try a different pancake dish that's not overkill on the sweets.

It has to be one of my favorite things to eat and one of my guilty pleasures! Ever since then, I always opted to go back, but because it was too far from where I lived, going there was usually only on very special occasions such as friends or relatives from out of town and they want a  local fav  breakfast joint.   After BabyStacks being so successful, they finally opened a new location right across from my old high school! I frequent now at the Buffalo/Flamingo location because its so close and convenient. Come early when they open because lines will get long!   My typical orders:  Red Velvet pancakes Peanut butter & banana pancakes Rocky road pancakes  These are my top three favorites. They are so good and more dessert like. I usually order my pancakes last because I need something fulfilling to eat at breakfast rather than sweets.  Build your own omelets- I'm a sucker for omelets. I love the option of building my own only for less than $10!  BabyStacks is a Hawaiian/Asian style breakfast joint so a lot of the dishes have rice, spam and macaroni.

I ordered the country fried steak with the babystack of red velvet and my boyfriend ordered the adobo fried rice, also with the red velvet -- SO SO GOOD! ESPECIALLY the pancakes! It tasted like fluffy clouds of red velvet goodness in my mouth, topped with delicious cream cheese syrup! I almost forgot I ordered anything else, my steak was so neglected! The adobo fried rice was pretty awesome too! Super flavorful and wrapped in egg like a burrito -- I ate most of my boyfriend's plate. I only took off a star because after we finished eating, we were kind of neglected and had to wait at least 20 minutes for our check. But don't go here without ordering their red velvet pancakes!

Thanks to Ardie Y, my friends and I found a new breakfast place to eat in Las Vegas.  We came on a Sunday morning and the restaurant was busy; I believe we waited 45 minutes.  Echo the hostess welcomed us and asked for our name.  In the front, there are benches so you can sit while you wait for your table.  I was looking at the menu and there were a lot of tempting breakfast items to choose from.  The pancakes that caught my attention were, carrot, bacon, hazelnut, cinnabun, banana cream pie, orange creamsicle, rocky road,  white chocolate chip macadamia nut, and cookies & cream.  We ordered Rick's Adobo Fried Rice (comes with one side), Portugese Sausage & Eggs, and Cora's Corned Beef Hash and Eggs.  Then we got pancakes, Banana Foster, Cinnabun, and Red Velvet.    ::Food:: I was curious about Rick's Adobo (traditional filipino dish) Fried Rice.  The way they served the adobo was creative.  It was wrapped in an omelette, inside was shredded chicken, rice, and garnished with green onions.  I like the concept but the flavor tasted different.  Also, there were more rice than chicken.  The Portuguese sausage and corned beef hash was good, they both came with poached eggs.

The Banana Foster is my favorite.  It was topped with caramelized bananas, whip cream, and cinnamon sugar.  Next is the Red Velvet (best seller), the color of the pancake was bright, it was topped with whipped cream, chocolate crumble and came with a side of cream cheese.  Then we also got the Cinnabon pancake.  It had sweet icing, crunchy pecans, and dusted with cinnamon and sugar.  I would get the Banana Foster, Red Velvet, and Portuguese Sausage & Eggs again!

I don't like this temporary new earlier schedule of ours. Having breakfast at breakfast time really sucks with the wait times and dampens the mood.  We had zippys chili omelette on the specials white board. It's pretty decent and a bit different. I never really thought about chili on eggs, but it makes sense.   I did a make your own skillet - potatoes with your choice of toppings (1 meat, 2 veggies, 1 cheese) and you can add additional toppings to the base price. I did carnitas, peppers, onions, pepper jack cheese and asked for green sauce on the side. It was decent, but different from most skillets that seem cooked together, this is more thrown on top and put in the broiler to melt the cheese.   We got our babystacks that come with our breakfast upgraded to their two new flavors on the white board. We did butterfinger which was rather nice and the butter finger pieces slightly melted were more peanutty in flavor and some parts crunchy. The creamsicle was decent, but I don't know if I'm just not a fan of orange flavored baked goods.   Service was alright. It took a while for someone to come see us and order but once we did food came out pretty quickly . Server and host were both friendly.   Yep. Same consistency of food as the original which is good.

The atmosphere is very casual, and not bad for a brunch place. I ordered the Huntington omelette and I wish I heeded Alana's review saying to stay away from it. It was pretty miserable. Everyone else at the table loved their food, but mine was by far the worst. An omelette with probably 2? or 1 1/2? pieces of bacon cut up into the omelette with nearly non-existent cheddar cheese mixed into the eggs, and half of an over-riped avocado slices on top. I will NEVER order that again. I got the specialty Almond Joy pancakes & I guess this was my fault, but I didn't expect a chocolate batter, because I am not a big fan of chocolate cakes or chocolate pastries, but obviously, this came with chocolate pancakes, with slices almonds, coconut, and whipped cream. They weren't THAT sweet, but I wish I ordered something else.  My husband got the country fried steak which I tried a piece of and was very tasty. He ordered banana cream pie pancakes which were the best of the table. My children had s'mores pancakes which came with marshmallows and graham cracker crumbles. I didn't try them, but they were engulfed in seconds since I try to limit their sugar intake. This was certainly a treat for them. They also had the breakfast combo with eggs and bacon. The bacon was great! Thick and perfectly cooked to a crisp. The carrot cake pancakes that my mother in law ordered were a flop. WAY too heavy and cake-like rather than light and fluffy like pancakes should be. I don't know if I would be back as I already have a favorite brunch spot, and we seldom go to brunch, but I can see the appeal of specialty pancakes and I would say to stick to those, and stay away from the Huntington omelette.", "Date": "2013-07-08", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Raina", "ReviewID": "miaxAyTd4ZsJn-uwN3-9ww", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I love BabyStacks!

I will say though that the times I have gone with a group, more specifically - my daughter in a wheelchair - the service was great.

The prices are great, the food is amazing, the service is great...the wait sucks but hey, at least they're busy enough to stay open so I can keep going back!

This place is good for one thing and one thing only: PANCAKES.   My girlfriend and I got here after waking up late on Sunday morning with an epic sweet tooth. She was craving chocolate cake so I figured this would be a great spot.   It was semi crowded by the time we got there. They told us it would be about 15 minutes, but we were given the option of sitting at the dining counter within 5 minutes. We aren't picky, so we took it! (One star here for under-promising and over-achieving. BabyStacks does a good job of over estimating wait times and then having you seated before your estimated wait time expires. This is great, in my opinion. Nothing bugs me more than being told 15 minutes and waiting 40.)   Ashley ordered the red velvet pancakes. She knew what she was getting before we even got there. I ordered the eggs and bacon with white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes ($1 upcharge for their specialty pancakes - well worth it).   Let me say this: the rest of their breakfast foods aren't all that great. The bacon actually didn't taste very good and the eggs were nothing special. The only reason I ordered them was because I figured I should get some protein in me. However, in all honesty, if you're coming here, you should be coming for pancakes and not expect much else. The home fries or breakfast potatoes were also pretty bland, as if they came from a frozen bag.   However, I'm still going to give 5 stars because I have never tasted better pancakes in my life. Ashley's red velvet pancakes came with cream cheese type syrup. They were UNBELIEVABLY MELT IN YOUR MOUTH DELICIOUS. My white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes were also good - not as good as hers - but still very soft, delicious, and with white chocolate morsels that were half melted into the pancakes. MMMM.

EVER. the worst part was that when we told the waitress that the corned beef hash tasted off, she didn't even seem surprised!!! she just asked if we wanted something else. only when she brought the new dish of bacon and eggs did she apologize. it was all quite shocking, actually. or maybe the sugar/carb high had us all foggy and unable to react faster. she did remove the dish from our bill without us having to ask her to - which was cool, but again, she didn't seem too fazed or apologetic about it.  when the hostess (who i'm guessing is the main proprietress?) asked us how everything went as were paying, i didn't have the heart to say anything about the corned beef. i certainly hope the waitress did, though, or at least brought it to the attention of the cook! after she took our plate away, i kept an eye/ear out to see if anyone else ordered it, but no other orders came out.   so, two stars with reservation because the pancakes were so good, but really should be one star for serving spoiled food. thankfully my senses are in overdrive from the pregnancy hormones so that it only took one tiny bite to know the corned beef was bad, which i promptly spit out anyway. future customers, beware! or just stick to the pancakes!!!", "Date": "2014-06-20", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Vince", "ReviewID": "hbIAhrr83T4mY3kAwmm1og", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Pancakes were good.

I love it!  Next, well, it's a small cozy nook so I expect that parking is minimal.. It's located inside a commercial complex so parking is not bad.. We just had to circle around once to find a suitable parking for our truck.  Being that it is a cozy little nook, of course waiting area is a bit packed when we got in. Cashier is also right there by the door so you have people trying to get out and people trying to get in at the same area.. One plus, there are benches where you can sit while you and your party waits. My only biggest comment would be that, I wish the hostess would smile. She doesn't look happy at all.. All the while, there's a sign that says  be nice or leave .. Well, how do you expect people to be nice and friendly when your hostess does not acknowledge the guest at all let alone smile? Even after I said thank you after she sat us at our table.. Still no smile. Don't get me wrong, she wasn't rude or anything.. But just please smile!  Our server on the other hand, Jamie, is very friendly and accommodating. All smiles and cheerful! She made sure my drinker are re-filled all the time.. She's very attentive. Great service! Good job!  Now, my favorite part of the review.. FOOD! Being a chef, this is where I tend to focus on. We ordered the Rick's Adobo Fried Rice wrapped in omelet. That was bomb!!! So tasty and fluffy! Absolutely delicious! As a side for it, I ordered Rocky Road Pancake. That was good too! Our server suggested to get that instead of the s'mores pancake. I'm happy I did! Then, we also ordered the Kahlua Grilled Cheese Sandwich. My fiancé said it was really good but if only the portion is bigger for the price they sell it for. And lastly, I ordered Loco Moco. That was amazing! But it wasn't enough rice.. Lol. I had to order an additional side of rice. Now, the macaroni salad that came with it, it was a bit bland. Could use more mayo and salt & pepper. Other than that, food was better than expected.. Service was amazing.  I would absolutely come back at Baby Stacks! Perhaps try the other food choices they have..

It is my favorite meal to eat out. It's simple. It's relaxing. It's friendly. It's a uncomplicated. A good breakfast joint still offers value, a sense of community and belly full of warm yummy goodness.  I learned to appreciate the beauty of a great breakfast joint at a place called the Red Hill Coffee Shop in Rancho Cucamonga Ca. Side note; It used to be just Cucamonga but then the powers that be got together and decided that tacking a Rancho on the front made it sound less looney tunish...... Nice try. So Red Hill Coffee Shop is the breakfast that all breakfast joints are judged by in my little world. And one of the things, among many, that place it on that oh so lofty pedestal are the hashbrowns.  Their hashbrowns are the shredded variety. Wonderfully crispy and brown on the outside and tender and moist on the inside. Each bite giving you that beautiful contrast of textures and when you get a little bit of the egg or syrup in that bite an added dimension of flavor. Another thing that makes the hashbrowns at RHCS so noteworthy; they don't hold back on the portion.  And that brings me to the point of this 2 star review. I live right around the corner from the S Buffalo location of Baby Stacks. I've seen the yelp and other reviews that have praised this place. I've noticed that it's fairly busy. But in Vegas I always take user reviews with a grain of salt. And that grain of salt gets bigger the closer you get to Summerlin. After all, this is the town in which the readers of the RJ consistently name PF Chang's the best Chinese restaurant (?).   So I stopped by BS this morning and ordered a side of hashbrowns to go. I didn't have time to sit down and eat a full breakfast. I figured a side of hashbrowns would be a good bell-weather for me. And I have to say it was. You ever go to a Denny's, which I haven't done in 20 years, and when the food comes you look at the hashbrowns and think,  Really? ?  Well in the case of the hashbrowns I got at BS this morning  Really?  would have been a stretch. It was a $3.18 smidgen of fried shredded potatoes. My 16 y/o called them an  epic fail .   I'm not usually an overly anal person. Obviously I love my hashbrowns but I felt I needed to quantify the ridiculousness of this order of hashbrowns, so I weighed them. With the togo container they weighed in at an anemic 2 oz. $3 for 2 oz of hashbrowns? Really? That's $24 a pound. This review has gone on way too long already to get into the millions of prepared foods that I can get for less than $24 a pound.  BS, I'm sure all your food is as wonderful as your many customers point out. I think it's great that you are a mom and pop business making a go of it. That in and of itself is praiseworthy. But come on, potatoes are cheap. The griddle is always running. It takes little effort to keep the hashbrowns flowing and plentiful. They are a low overhead item that makes people say to their friends,  Great breakfast joint, and you should see the hashbrowns.

The crepe, was just a crepe.  But the pancakes were warm and delicious and so much like a red velvet cupcake.  A perfect accompaniment to my slightly salty kalua pig.  The kalua pig was perfectly salted and made me miss home just a bit.  The portion was generous; if I were going home after brunch, I'd save some to eat for later.

They opened a location on South Buffalo because this location became so popular and it is super small. Which comes to my gripe with BabyStacks, not because there is a wait but because every time I go or call ahead to check the wait time, it is ALWAYS off sometimes in my favor, sometimes not but it drives me crazy. You may be busy but you are also turning people away. Get your table times in check. It's breakfast your table time should be about an hour, hour and half for a chatty table.

To top it off they don't split checks so that was a bit of a inconvenience considering none of us carry cash.

The restaurant is pretty tight, as in it was a little small. We arrived around lunch time so there was a good amount of people when we arrived. We were seated, however, right away which definitely deserves an A+. Our waitress was super friendly and attentive the entire time. Food came out pretty quick so A+ for that as well. On to the food... first the red velvet pancakes.. was I expecting red velvety battered goodness? Yes. Did I get it? No. They were pretty much pancakes with red food coloring topped with whipped cream and sprinkled with mini chocolate chips. Nothing mind blowing. The cream cheese syrup tasted like the icing you would find in a store bought cinnaroll can. Once again, nothing special. For me, total fail to the excitement I had before I actually tasted them. Now on to the saviour of this review... the adobo omellett. It was a hefty size. I was expecting more egg than filling but thankfully I was wrong. It was chockful of yummyness! The rice tossed with the adobo sauce and shredded chicken were delightful for my taste buds. The creamy side Mac salad was a great addition to the dish. All in all I had an ok experience. I chose 3 stars based on the fact that I was expecting to have my taste buds blown away... but all I got was a fizzle.

Two of my friends got the red velvet pancakes as well. We absolutely loved them! They are soo delicious. They're the perfect combination of a bit of chocolatey flavor & cream cheese. They were also very fluffy and light, but the edges had a little crispiness to them which was good.  The hash browns and eggs were yummy as well. The steak, however, wasn't all that. It had a very charred taste to it. I ordered it medium rare and there was very little pink to it. It was also very tough and hard to chew. I could have done without the steak.  The ambiance of the place was nice. It was very clean. I don't think they turn on the A/C though, which I didn't mind much but my friends did. They had ceiling fans running but I guess with that many people in one place, it tends to get a little warm.   We waited for about 20 minutes to get a table because it was so busy, this isn't a bad thing.. just shows how good this place is. Our server was very nice and friendly.

In the end I only ended up waiting 10 minutes.   I felt a little bit claustrophobic walking in, it was really packed and all of the tables were very close together. You could lean over and eat off of your neighbors plate!   Our waitress came out quick and took our order. For my drink  I decided to go with coffee, blah! It was gross. The coffee tasted watered down like they prepared it, dumped half of it out and refilled it with water, I could get a better tasting cup at McDonald's. For my breakfast entree I went with Cora's corned beef hash, eggs over medium, and substituted the buttermilk pancakes, instead I got the red velvet pancakes.  Food came out quick as well, the corned beef hash was seasoned well, tasted great, but my eggs came out over easy instead of over medium. The red velvet pancakes were mighty tasty, very fluffy and a little crisp on the outside. They were topped off with whipped cream, which went well with the cream cheese syrup. After our food came out the waitress disappeared, we were to never see her again. We were never asked how the food was or if we wanted any refills. We are very generous tippers when we get great service, on this occasion I was thinking of not even leaving a tip but I'm not that rude, she got $3 for her disappearing act!

Came here on a recommendation and damn is it good.  First off, the menu is pretty big and pretty awesome. It's got a unique / filipino flair to it with their Portuguese sausage, adobo omelette thing (side note: it's not really an omelette). They had a special Kalua Pork Sliders or something like that when I was there.  Nearly everything comes with pancakes and they have a ton of different kinds from S'mores to Rocky Road to Banana Cream Pie to Red Velvet, etc. The list goes on, but your stomach will not. It's only $1.50 to upgrade your regular pancake order to one of their fancier ones...and I'd recommend that if I were you.  I got the Mexican omelette ($9.25), which was awesome. It comes with 4 eggs in the omelette. It also has the option of either seasoned potatoes or hash browns...I opted for the hash browns on a spur of the moment decision, but I think I'd go for the seasoned potatoes next time. They're not huge pieces of dry potatoes, but really crispy, smaller pieces that make them perfect. I made that mistake, but you live and you learn. My friend got toast with her omelette...not sure if it was a side of toast or somehow it came with her meal, but when they give you toast, they don't mess around...she had 6 1/2 bread slices (so 3 whole slices for those not good at math).

Me and the hubby usually get eggs and bacon, which also comes with potatoes (I would recommend the hashbrowns) and toast/english muffin.

The pancakes usually look pretty good - if you like decadent pancakes, they definitely have those here!  I would recommend getting there early though - none of their locations are really big, so if you get there too late, you'll end up waiting.

Red Velvet pancakes:  TO DIE FOR!  The cream cheese syrup is super sweet so use sparingly.  They are so wonderful though!  Carrot cake pancakes:  Very good, but tough to live up to the red velvet that every other review praises.     The chicken and chili omelet:  very well balanced, but a bit larger then I really needed with the pancakes, we can not finish both and always have extras.   Honey toast: flavor very good, this is a good version of french toast and I would recommend it for anyone who is looking for a sweet breakfast dish.  I can not remember the exact name but this is what I ordered incorrectly: the skillet of eggs, potatoes, and pork with salsa on the side was a bit dry.

The poached egg was poached hard (Not runny) which I like a little more runny, but that's ok, and I could always go for more hollandaise! haha!

The  chick  aka, chicken, was in the form of 3 small pieces. VERY disappointing!

My dear hubby doesn't. He mostly hates the smell and idea of griddle fry. Don't blame him so this weekend, a holiday weekend, he asks,  Wanna go to breakfast?  Um, YEAH! So off we go to wait somewhere for breakfast. I chose a no-egg-in-title-ergo-no-griddle-fry, breakfast joint, for this rare occasion. Been to Babystacks a couple years ago before the name change. It was good but mostly crowded, and we were suckered into ordering the red velvet pancakes. As pancakes go, they were good, but honestly, it was a mistake to order because not particularly a fan of red velvet because of the systematic abuse of red food coloring and fake chocolate flavor that occurred as a result of the trend that been red velvet in the last decade, as opposed to the light cocoa flavor it's supposed to have. This time, however, we partook in the Hawaiian-style brekkie (Moco Loco and Portuguese sausage and eggs w rice) as well as a skillet and of course many sides of many non-red velvet pancakes (banana cream pie, cookies and cream, lemon ricotta) plus a Nutella crepe. Suffice it to say, everything was delicious, not greasy, no odor of the dreaded griddle fry, and despite all the food ordered, we all left satisfied and not overly stuffed. There was a wait, but turn-around was efficient and quick as could be. Place was clean and friendly and did we mention no griddle fry? Btw, their red velvet pancakes are, in fact, good if you still like the trend, er...flavor.   Him: The pancakes were soft and delicious. I ordered cookies and cream pancakes. They were so chocolatey. They came with cream and glaze, but I didn't even need the glaze. Also, I loved the skillet. It wasn't a scramble, just over-easy eggs on top, so there were sautéed veggies underneath and they were so good. I couldn't stop eating them. There were potatoes, onion, peppers and mushroom and cheese. There was a wait but it felt like forever (it actually was about 20 mins after told 30). That is how good the place is: everyone wants to eat there so we had to wait forever. It was worth the wait.

I believe the original location is on Buffalo and Smoke Ranch.  Although, the location that I frequent is the expansion branch on Buffalo and just south of Flaming-O.  Baby Stacks, to me, falls into that Island-Style breakfast category that you can find at Cinnamon's and Boots & Kimo's on the Windward side of Oahu, nestled in beautiful Kailua.  This style consists of the normal comfort breakfasts including spam or pocho sausages with rice and eggs your way in addition to loco mocos, an island favorite.  But specialty benedicts and an elaborate pancake menu is now a common theme in island breakfasts.  I usually get the kalua pork eggs benedict but opted for the grilled cheese kalua pork sandwich on special.  The sandwich was good, but more appealing to the eyeballs than the taste buds.  Also, I have this unquenchable appetite for Tabasco, sue me, and tend to douse my kalua pork and manapuas in it, I'm talking drowning...lol.  If it weren't for my spicy little friend, the meal could have been much worse.  A banana cream pie stack was added and by far my favorite aside from carrot cake pancakes so far.  The white chocolate mac nut is again more name than anything.  My lady went with the zesty chicken omelet and like most onomatopoeia, was exactly that...zesty.  The place is a hit, both locations, so be prepared to wait if you aren't there before the rush.  The place reminds me of home with smiles from local islanders, but, I know for a fact that a lot of mainlanders aren't big on it and the culture, so beware.    Otherwise, decor and ambiance is good and staff is friendly and attentive.  The check out dude has a Filipino accent and a little rough around the edges, so bare with him.  Parking is plentiful and although, not quite on the level of Cinnamon's, the place is definitely worth a look.  The sad thing is that there is no seafood related items on the menu, such as lox and the the like.  I know breakfast is not synonymous with fish, but I came here on a Friday during lent, and my selections were limited.  I had to settle for a spinach omelet and a short stack, but it didn't quell the monsters in my tummy.

Lets get to the must orders: Pancakes - Red Velvet (if you like it, not my favorite but a guest favorite, get sauce on side if you don't like things too sweet) - Banana cream Pie - LOVE IT, but I always get the sauce on the side since its too much for me - Chocolate Chip - LOVE IT Crepes -Solid Choice, but you can also get at buffets so, usually I pass on this one Adobo Fried Rice Omelette - Delicious! Must try Loco Moco - Good gravy, not as good as in hawaii, but you can add garlic rice here which I recommend!  They also have usual breakfast items like Ham, bacon, corned beef hash, etc. These are all not bad items, but also you can also get them anywhere and they do a find job of making these dishes. I only talked about the ones above because they're my favorites and you can't get at too many other places.

It appears to be a family owned establishment, and that showed by the warm, genuine welcome we received upon entering the front door. On a Sunday, BabyStacks was packed, but we were able to snag a table in about ten minutes.   BabyStacks has a reputation for a robust menu featuring every pancake flavor you can think of, in addition to hearty breakfast classics that come with a unique Filipino touch. I wanted both sweet and savory in my belly before the journey home to San Diego, and, therefore, opted to have the Kalua Pork Benedict and a small order of the Carrot Cake Pancakes with cream cheese icing.   The Kalua Pork Benedict was amazing. The pork was succulent and flavorful. Loved the potatoes on the side. Unless you're a vegetarian, I challenge anyone to have a bite of this dish and not walk away happy. I enjoyed the Carrot Cake Pancakes, but I regretted not picking a different flavor. The pancakes were very good, but they weren't as moist as I was imagining them to be. On my next visit, I'm going to have the Banana Cream Pie Pancakes.   My breakfast companion opted for the Adobo Rice Omelette. An imaginative dish that worked on every level. I snagged a bite and would have equally been pleased had I ordered it.

I finally made up my mind and got the cookie butter french toast (which was absolutely amazing by the way), the red velvet pancakes, and the Rick's adobo fried rice. As I was eating the adobo, I couldn't help but to notice the egg-to-rice ratio. There was simply too much egg for it to be considered an omelette.   I've always been sketchy about breakfast food but after my experience with the French toast, I've decided that brunch is a must for me every weekend. If you let the whip cream melt for a bit before eating your french toast/pancake, it is definitely worth it!   The one thing I wished for was that the location was bigger. There was a tremendous amount of people waiting and it was about a 45-minute wait for three which is pretty excessive for a brunch place.   Overall, I was highly satisfied with BabyStacks and can not wait to come back on my next trip to Vegas!

I like that the omelets came with pancakes and you have the option to upgrade to one of the crazy flavors. I got the red velvet because of all the reviews and DANG! They were great.

And if YOU LOVE PANCAKES, this place is a MUST!  What makes this place even better is their Asian inspired breakfast items...makes the whole family happy!  We loved this place so much we came here twice during our one week vacation here in Vegas.   On both of our visits the place was crowded, but we were seated in less than 10 minutes. Service was friendly and fast. From the time we placed our order to the time we got our food, probably was only about 10 minutes.   Everything we ordered was soo good! The spam scramble w/garlic fried rice, cookies and cream pancakes, adobo fried rice, bananas foster pancakes, kalua pork grilled cheese and spam and eggs were all equally delicious!  Whether you are in the mood for sweet or savory, you can't go wrong with any of the dishes.   Just to highlight on a few: 1) The garlic fried rice is quite tasty!  Just like how my mom used to make it. Lots of garlic flavor, just enough salt and even some bits of the rice is crunchy. I like my rice like that, brings back childhood memories.   2) The Kalua pork grilled cheese was delish! The pork was smoky and had the perfect amount of saltiness to it. The Muenster and cheddar cheese made this grilled cheese oozing with cheesy goodness.   3) Bananas foster pancakes - saving the best for last! My mouth is salivating as I'm writing about these pancakes!  The pancake alone is fluffy and has great flavor. The brown sugar butter combo serves as the syrup in this dish, thank goodness. It has the right amount of sweetness and the bananas was caramelized perfectly.

I got lucky on my first visit and only waited a few minutes, but on my second visit, we waited nearly an hour :(  Between the two visits:  Highlights were the red velvet pancakes (yum all around), adobo fried rice omelette and corned beef hash w/ garlic rice  Be warned, the garlic rice isn't just a hint of garlic, it's full force garlic, which was fine by me.   Lemon ricotta pancakes had great flavor, but the texture was soggy, which is why I probably wouldn't order it again.  Being from Hawaii, I love places that remind me of home, which Babystacks does.

For the most part, It is just your standard breakfast fare. The pancakes are delicious and creative, but a lot of places have delicious and creative pancakes. You will never show up here and not have to wait a minimum of 30 minutes for a table, so the sole reason that I suffer the wait is that it's the only place I can get garlic rice. And it's GOOD garlic rice. Today I joined a few friends for brunch. We met at 12:30, were seated around 1, and unfortunately got the table next to the window. And the air conditioning was apparently broken. It was 108 outside and at least 150 inside. At one point, Satan stopped by our table to ask how the food was. Ok, I may have hallucinated the Satan part, as I was in full on heat stroke. It was difficult to enjoy the meal with all the sweat that was dripping into it. I couldn't help but feel sorry for the employees back in the hot kitchen. In the Las Vegas summer, you have to put more effort into temperature control. If I'm waiting 30 minutes for a table, I expect you're bringing in enough revenue to invest in a couple fans at least.

I had to get up and ask a bus boy for drinks since no one would even glance at us. I again had to get up and ask for someone to take our order another 5 minutes after that, which he got mad about because he said it was not his section. The other tables all around us got immediate service the whole time. I found out our waitress was supposed to be Cassandra. When I asked her for help, she was extremely rude and gave me a ton of excuses of why she didn't help us. She never came back to the table after that. Our food was delivered by someone else and we were eventually checked on by a different person. I realized that we were the only white people in the entire place and it's extremely sad to think that this is why we were ignored and everyone else was helped.

I decided long and hard after mulling over the menu that I needed to have my savory and sweet! Country gravy was made with real ham and not at all heavy.  More creamy and just the perfect amount smeared on the steak.  The potatoes are so good! Like little steak fries! And probably the best part was the Red Velvet Stacks! So incredibly light and tasty, just like a cupcake except topped off with homemade whip cream and dusted with some chocolate shavings! OUR mistake to not include the cream cheese sauce it arrived with was disheartening but I may go without again.    Hubbs ordered the massive Rick's rice and Egg omlet and it was HUGE! Super tasty too! Never thought that combo of rice inside a massive omlet could be so good. I think that the macaroni salad tasted almost like kimchi and so I could not wrap myself around it.
