Tried this place twice and doesn't seem like it will be getting better. I work here at town square and thought I would try this place for lunch but very rare do they ever answer the phone and when they do they place u on hold for about 10 minutes. I walked over to order in person and it's dead so don't know why I was on hold for so long. And when I came the other night with some friends we were ordering food and drinks and after every drink and food order the waitress kept bringing the check and kept trying to get us to leave! I mean there was about 6 of us we wanted to spend money! Oh well their loss. I don't recommend this place and at this rate I expect them to go out of business soon.", "Date": "2016-05-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Brandon", "ReviewID": "OWQ2GMrpsIc0NeZ24YKtZw", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Been here 3 times now and place just isn't enjoyable. Always go for taco Tuesdays for $2 tacos and the tacos are alright, not the greatest. The biggest issue is service, the place is always empty so it makes no sense why service is so terrible. Couple times I've joined friends already there and the server doesn't even notice new people at the table. After waiting a good 10min, server finally comes but only asks one person if they need anything instead of going around the table or even looking up to see if anyone else needs anything and then walks off. Only for me to shout or chase them down saying I want to order. Server never comes back to see if food or anything is alright. With the place so empty and slow you can see the server just standing around, doing nothing.lol When it comes to getting the check, your best to ask for it once you order the food, otherwise they will never bring it or even come by asking. It's always a hassle trying to get the check and when the check comes, there's always some kind of issue, overcharge for an item or something on it I never ordered. Place has potential, but right now it's a complete joke until they can change their service. I'd rather go to Tacos and Beers on Paradise for taco Tuesdays where the atmosphere is amazing, has great beats (and can still hear ppl), and great service! Tacos are $3, but I'll pay the extra dollar for all of that!

I got greeted by what I would presume is the manager, so far so good. I head to the bar to place a to go order. The bartender walks over and gives me a menu. I'm sitting there, clearly ready to order, but no bartender in site. The manager has to walk back over and take my order for her. After about a 10 minute wait (which was not a bad wait time) the manager walks my food out. Again, the bartender doesn't find me important enough to do her job. The manager handed me my food and I said sir I haven't paid yet. So he hands my card to the bartender. She continues to make a drink for the other person who was at the place. Mind you, it was me and two other people in the entire restaurant. I thought, okay finish making the drink that is fine. So she walks the drink over and then continues to take their order. When she finally comes back over to finally cash me out, she puts my card on the bar (doesn't hand me my card back) and gives me my receipt and says thank you smugly. I normally give a tip on bar service, but not today. IF YOU DONT LIKE YOUR JOB, GET A NEW ONE! The manager here really should reconsider who he has working for him.

Not to my surprise, they were closed. The setting at Loco Cantina is that of a bar bistro, lots of chrome, brushed steel and wood. Very rustic.   1-5 rairings:  ambiance - 5 I was allowed to pick my own seat and chose a booth close to the window. large leather seats that sit at a bar height. lights were low and the music was up just enough that you could still converse without yelling.  wait staff - 5 I was greeted at the door and conversed with my waitress about some of the menu itena, and a movie I was to see after dinner. I forget my waitresses name, but she was great and I really felt at home.  price of food - 4 $3.50 for a street taco is a bit high, perhaps a happy hour food menu would help  taste of food - 5 food was amazing. I had the ceviche and two tacos. this is a place I could spend $100 on myself just trying one of everything.  overall I highly recommend Loco Cantina if you're at town square.", "Date": "2016-02-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Reiley", "ReviewID": "2AsMAdk3YX1geBM6C4R99Q", "Overall": "5", "Content": "My boyfriend and I have been to this place twice and we loved it so much the first time we had to come back.

We had the chips and salsa, they are a must but beware of the salsa verde if you don't like spicy! We had the queso fundido for an appetizer and it was awesome. I ordered the shrimp ceviche which was delicious, and a barbacoa taco that was really good as well. My boyfriend ordered the barbacoa and pastor tacos which he loved too. All in all we had a great experience and we had no problems with service. This place is only 2 months old! So hard to believe there are so many people hating on this place lol it's brand new. I don't know what any of these people are talking about with the  terrible service . We haven't had bad service either times that we have gone.

Period. If i would be able to put 0\5, i would do that with out any hesitation at all.  1. Time of serving. We went over there at 11.10. Made main orders and appetizers, and .... we were waiting for more than 20 minutes to get our chips... Seriously ?    20 minutes ? That's more than enough time to go to a Wholefoods buy chips there, come back to that  restaurant  and serve it to myself. The main dishes came at 11.50, 40 minutes after we went inside.   When we were done eating our food, we were waiting for more than 10 minutes to get our receipts, than they forgot to take cards from some people, and we were waiting extra 15 minutes.  I don't know about the owner perception of time, but for me and other people  - time is  more than important, and i don't like spending  it on waiting for something because of the BAD SERVICE.  2. Food. The menu doesn't describe food very well, just a general information, and it's pretty hard to know what you are ordering. Taste of food in general just ok, nothing special, except size of tacos, that  restaurant  invented a new type of tacos -  babe tacos, the smallest tacos what i tried in my life.  3. Prices. Babe tacos for 3.5. Well those numbers speak for itself.

My girlfriend, her co-worker, and I went during lunch on Cinco De Mayo--it was not busy at all. Our server, Jessica, said she started 5 days ago. We ordered waters and chips and salsa. Jessica brings out our chips and salsa and forgets our water. She apologizes and leaves but never comes back with the waters. The salsa was incredibly spicy and my mouth was burning but I didn't have any water to wash it down. About 10-15 minutes goes by and still no waters so we go up to the bartender and ask for them to which we see our server giving other people water. She walks over to us and hands us 4 waters when there are 3 of us.  I get the chicken burrito and it had shredded chicken (tasted awful) and was below average at best. It was literally drenched in a spicy butter and it kept leaking down the side of my hand and it created a puddle of oil on my plate.   My girlfriend's coworker orders a vegetarian taco on FLOUR tortilla but she receives some roasted bell peppers on a CORN tortilla w/ some salsa on it. Flustered, she said she came here a few days ago and ordered the same thing and it had other stuff on it. She went to the bartender to ask if they can re-make it for her and they got it correct the second time.   We wanted more chips and salsa but she forgot it TWICE. Between getting the waters, the food, the refill on chips/salsa, napkins, utensils etc. it probably took about 10 minutes or more in between each request. Also, with three of us being there.. she brought us 4 waters & 5 sets of utensils. Jessica must have apologized to us 15 times and almost every time she came back with something she would just apologize constantly.  The music was incredibly loud and it was hard to hear each other talking when we were sitting pretty close to each other. It was a really windy day and the server set down the first order of chips and salsa and it immediately started to take flight. We needed a copy of our receipt to redeem reward points and we had to wait another 10 minutes for the manager to print it out to us. He explained that he couldn't print it out for us because it is too complicated on their system but he Xerox copied it for us on an 8.5x11 piece of copier paper. Furthermore, after we explained everything to the manager, he did not mention anything about Jessica's performance rather he gave us an excuse as to why it is annoying printing out a copy of our receipt and the only other thing he said was  sorry, next time, I'll make your food for you so there isn't any issues....   All in all, between Jessica forgetting our waters, not refilling, forgetting our utensils, having us ask multiple times for some chips and salsa, waiting way too long for our food, waiting way too long between requests, waiting about 15 minutes to receive our check after we asked, and another 10 minutes to get our 15% off from the coupon we had, and our food tasting horribly, I would not recommend this place to anyone; just go to Robertos.", "Date": "2016-05-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "CC", "ReviewID": "WRIBQ1Gn79-uLef8lY04Ow", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Came here on Halloween with my 12-year-old son, and we had a great time.

My party of 4 decided to try a new place and made a reservation knowing it was going to be busy due to it being cinco de mayo. So starters our outside patio reservation wasn't available, but since we did got there 20 mins before our reservation we sat inside and were told we would be moved to the patio once one becomes avail (at 7pm our reservation time). We sit down and start looking at our menus and 20 mins go by and still no waitress has come to us to greet us, so we flag down 1 waitress to ask who will be our server and she rudly replies  it's not me, ask the hostess  and runs to another table. The place was busy not not overly crowded with lots of tables were still avail..Irritated we sat there and finally 10 mins later we get a waitress to order our food/drinks and tells us that there's a 20 min wait for drinks at the bar (after 30 mins of sitting we now have to wait another 20 mins for drinks!!). We order our food and 20 mins later we get our chips & guacamole, burrito and I had nachos which was all actually really good, but we didn't get any napkins and trying to find someone to get some was a nightmare, finally we see a bus boy and he give us 3 napkins (for a party of 4)   We sat at our table patiently waiting for our drinks knowing it was cinco de mayo and kept trying to give this place a 2nd chance to change our minds to just leave. So another 10 mins past and still no drinks and the place started to empty out a little and we only see 1 bartender behind the bar (on cinco de mayo).. . by now we are all irritated that it's been 1 hr into our night out and no drinks yet.  At this point we decide to cancel our drinks and get our check but trying to get someones attention was impossible!  Finally our waitress comes to our table with 2 pinkish drinks (we ordered 4) and apologized then tells us  there is some confusion at the bar and we don't know which drink is which  ..I ordered strawberry and my friend had peach, thankfully we didn't get charged for the drinks since they were wrong and missing half. We get our checks (we split them) and left elsewhere to enjoy the rest of our cinco de mayo. Then to top it off they charged the wrong check on the wrong card, it was only $14 but still frustrating!   Overall the food is good,but due to the horrible/slow service I won't back .

The Pastor and Barbacoa tacos were street style size and came on store bought tortillas, which is a huge bummer for me, but the Pastor meat was seasoned nicely and was very tender.  The Barbacoa was ok, it needed some spice and maybe salt, it was pretty much like eating plain meat with pickled veggies. Tortillas for any Mexican style restaurant should always be handmade or at the least locally made and sent over.

When asked what kind of tequila was in the margaritas the waitress replied,  We are too busy for me to know that right now.  We should have left at that point. She told us the tacos were a $1.00 each for the holiday. We ordered 3 margaritas and a glass of wine. We ended up having to go the bar for the margaritas and were told the wine is being poured and will be brought out. 30 minutes later the waitress comes back to the table and asks where we got the drinks from and was annoyed that we got our own. She then looked at me and said,  I don't know what happened to your wine.  Then she walked away. It took 15 minutes for the manager to come to our table who then proceeded to try to charge us $120 for this mess.

We waited FOREVER to get our drink order, and then even longer to even get our drinks.  Our service only improved after another table that our waitress was servicing complained to the manager about their equally poor service.  After that, service was better, but our server still messed up a drink order.    Food was pretty good overall.  We got a couple orders of the queso fundido and guacamole.  The first order of queso was really good and horded my certain members of our group.  The second order came out really bad - a half inch layer of grease on the top.  The manager was very kind to return this one and replace it with another order.  The guacamole was also pretty good, but basic.  Entree wise, I think their menu is very limited, and they should really advertise that their tacos are street taco size.  I ordered a chicken taco, fried shrimp taco, and a side of rice and beans.  The flavor of both tacos was pretty good, although there was gristle in my chicken taco, and there was like only 1 shrimp in my shrimp taco.  The rice and beans I would pass up on next time - no flavor at all.  My husband and one of our friends had also gotten chicken tacos - and found bones in their tacos.    Lastly, because it was for a birthday, the manager did provide banana lumpia for dessert.  This was pretty good - caramel flavor, crisp shell, and a side of ice cream.  This too was horded by certain members of our party.  Overall, food was so-so, and really because service was so bad, I would not recommend this place, and we will not be returning.

We ordered a carnitas torta (beautiful presentation) and a Pastor Taco. Here's the deal with tacos...they are STREET tacos...not CHIPOTLE tacos. lol So, yes, they are smaller! But they are supposed to be! They are delicious! I only ordered one but, after beer, chips and guac, and the loaded street taco I was totally full. If you know street tacos are too small for you-order something else. Their fajitas looked delicious- we want to order those next time!   Lastly, we saw a chef walk through the bar and decided to compliment him on the food. Saul, the executive chef was so grateful, kind, and introduced himself. He took over the restaurant 2 weeks ago and is an absolute pleasure. He is from Tampico, Mexico.

We were worried but also up for a new food experience at Town Square.  The waitress was the only person we interacted while there, again because it was empty. She was wonderful, although she did not know the brand of their house wine and another minor inquiry. She was still helpful, attentive and pleasant. When we first sat down, she said,  Should I get you some chips and salsa while you look over the menu?  To me, at a Mexican restaurant, one might assume that they are free, but take note: Their chips and salsa are not. While they are bottomless once you order them, they are still $3. That was one of those eye rolling moments, but again, she was pleasant and helpful. Side note: Since we were mainly the only ones in there, they had some Sunday NFL games on (that we weren't watching) and the volume was very loud, with a speaker right near us. She kindly turned it down for us at a more enjoyable level.  The place was mostly clean and things seemed brand new. There is definitely a good drink selection and it seems as if their Happy Hour would have some good deals, although we had just missed that time frame. My wine pour was solid and how can you be mad about that?? (See photo!) Fountain drinks are also approx. $3.  Price range was bearable for what you were getting. The servings weren't daunting but most were hefty and certainly filling. There was a mix of foods at our table: Salad, Burger, quesadilla, Mexican fries (highly recommend), street tacos (3) platter choice and tamales. Pretty good representation of what they can do, I would imagine. Also, checking into Yelp (at the time of our visit) earned us dessert churros - definitely try!!!!!!  Additional food notes: 1) My tempura avocado street taco had ONE tempura avocado piece. A little disappointing, but it IS a small little street taco. Still, I was like,  really?  :D 2) I am a whimp when it comes to spice, but the salsa that you get in the  chips and salsa  has quite a kick, even for the average spicy enthusiast. 3) The chips are those flaky, buttery chips that you want to eat all in one sitting.

Nicely crisp, not greasy, and great flavor. Happy hour specials only include drinks, since tacos are only about $3.50 each not much room for a discount. Chips and salsa are not complementary, but still not overly expensive (we passed on it this trip).  Sodas are fairly priced on he menu, unlike other restaurants at Town Square at $4+.

I'll start off with the bad:  1. Chips and salsa are 3 bucks. Also, the salsa was in a tube. They don't give you a bowl to dip it in or anything. Not sure if they expect you to put it on every chip one by one or what but it's probably the dumbest thing I've ever seen. Also, it doesn't say if refills are free so we didn't wanna chance it with getting more chips.   2. The tacos are TINY. Probably the worst size taco I've ever seen and they're $3.50. Taste was whatever and they were somewhat cold. I can't believe they charge $3.50 for those things.   3. The fajitas are also tiny. They're $14 and they give you for 4 corn tortillas to eat them all. They charge and extra $2.75 for rice and another $2.75 if you want beans. Crazy.   The good:  1. Service was good. We got everything fast and our server was super nice.   2. The chorizo fries tasted good but they were more like chili cheese fries.  Overall:  I just can't get over the prices and the portions. Their food isn't good enough to charge what they charge.

Slow, mediocre service  at best.   I ordered a pomegranate margarita and the waitress literally talked me out of it.  So I just went for the classic. I can't go wrong with a classic margarita.  After 15 mins the drinks finally came out.  The margarita had a weird taste, like tap water.  I never send drinks back... Because I like alcohol, duh.  But this one I just couldn't suffer through, I asked the waitress if I could trade it for another flavor. Same weird taste. I thought it was me, so I let my friend try it. He said it tasted like a burp. How gross is that!?  I've never had a margarita I didn't like.   Food Service was so slow considering it was so slow.... Over 45 minutes.

The manager Shannon made her rounds as well, and I will have to say that the playlist she has made fire this place is pretty on point.  We got a few things: bean and cheese nachos w/ homemade guacamole, a shredded chicken burrito, a chorizo burrito, steak fajitas, and the churros. The nachos come in a cast iron skillet, loaded with poco and jalapeños. The burritos were large, like straight from Mexico. They were stuffed full. The fajitas came with beans, rice, and 3 tortillas. More than enough. Lastly, the churros! They were warm, cream filled, drizzled with caramel, and came with a cup of vanilla ice cream.  There are a few negative comments on here about being charged for chips. You have to look at the fact that this place isn't even 3 weeks old yet. They can't just start handing out free stuff right off, they have to build a customer base. Pay the $3 for unlimited chips and salsa. They are even willing to give you some togo.

Food: I thought the overall quality and taste of the food was great but was a little dissapointed with the price in comparison to the portion. This restaurant strikes me as a place that would do well serving drinks and appetizers before or after a night out. Shrimp fajitas were $16 and I got 3 flour tortillas to eat about 10 shrimp. Would think that more of an $8-$10 entree. Highly recommended the fiesta lemonade and senorita for drinks.  Service: 5 star service, our server was very personable and you could tell she was a true people person. Also very accomodating when one member of our group was not satisfied with their drink.

We chose to sat on the patio due to the weather and the view which is fantastic of Town Square. We were met again a few minutes later by our server, while not an inordinate amount of time was alittle longer then anticipated. She was quick to take our drink though seemed disappointed we ordered water while looking for a stronger drink to order, she again asked if we'd prefer a Margarita or cocktail before leaving as we had yet to make a selection.   After 5 or so minutes our water arrived though still no napkins and silverware eventually had to ask for these. Ordered a drink which was a shocking 10 dollars for a margarita that was smaller then my water glass and not very strong at all. We also ordered an appetizer of Queso Fundido. This took a long while to arrive and was basically a mass of melted cheese in a bowl with some chili on top. No sauce to and no seasoning. After some more time we finally ordered our main course of a chicken taco apiece and some soup.  The chicken tortilla soup was fantastic, the chorizo chili not so much basically a bowl of oil and meat. Chicken tacos while looking delicious left some to be desired as also lacking seasoning and dry.  Bottom line: while the food was priced very well and my soup wasn't bad though overall the food was eh. Drinks were weak and very over priced and the service was definately not on par as even getting the bill was 15 minute wait mind you on a Sunday afternoon with only 20 people in the place.

I love their patio and it is really nice how open the restaurant is. My kids and I were going to see a movie on a night my wife was out with her friends. I decided to stop by since it was right across from the theater. The service was pretty good, but the food was even better. I had the street tacos (the trio) and it was very good. I enjoyed the food, the atmosphere and the place very much. My family and I will definitely visit again.", "Date": "2017-01-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "John", "ReviewID": "RqC6njbQvxuF8_8iiy8jgQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Great place!

No enthusiasm, no smiles, my husband stood there waiting to be acknowledged. The hostess looked at him then looked down and shuffled menus. He literally had to walk up to the podium and stand close to her to be acknowledged.   Sat down and waited... Waited... WAITED... 15 minutes without any acknowledgement from a server. Offered no water. It was literally like our table was invisible. So we left.   It was early Saturday night, the place was pretty empty. There should be no excuse for not even getting any kind service. #customerservicefail  My husband works at Town Square, and regularly eats lunch & enjoys happy hour at TS. Needless to say... We will not be recommending @lococantina to his co-workers.", "Date": "2016-04-17", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Chad", "ReviewID": "WWSaIVt5juGAzsTmRP2YbA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Love Taco Tuesday's.

The atmosphere looked great, plenty of outdoor seating looking over Town Square, so we decided to check it out.  We walked in and were seated for an early dinner. Only two other tables were filled.  We asked our waitress about a few of the menu selections. We ordered a margarita and sangria. If you like canned pineapple, then definitely get the sangria. There were a few thin lime slices and chunk pineapple Very surprised it was not fresh.   We ordered guacamole as an appetizer. Not sure if it was canned, but definitely a mix, not homemade. It had that whipped appearance and feeling.   We also ordered chips & salsa but never got them. I did like their chips, they were also served warm.  Next was the nachos.  If you like ballpark canned cheese, I recommend getting the nachos, Chips topped with some black beans, a little bit of diced tomato, smothered in canned cheese, some sour cream and a dollop of guac. It's best to eat them with a fork, which we also had to ask for silverware too.  The tacos we ordered were good.  As for the ceviche - two or three boiled shrimp, chopped up with some avocado, cucumber, tomato and lime juice. It appeared to be thrown together quickly and served luke warm instead of chilled in the same type bowl as the guacamole. Did not look like the pictures posted on Yelp.  I was really looking forward to trying this place out and liking it. With a great atmosphere, its just not enough to make me want to go back.", "Date": "2016-09-27", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Heather", "ReviewID": "QPXCw3RwJ5Tbg7Q59TC9RA", "Overall": "2", "Content": "I really wanted to like this place.  I work in the area and am always looking for a new lunch place.  Got there right at 11 am, and there was no one else in there.  We were seated pretty quickly, but from there on the service was horrible.  It took 10 minutes to take our order.  After we finally got our food, the server didn't come back for another 25 minutes.  We were the ONLY ones there.  When she did come back and see that we were done, she didn't clear the plates and we waited another 12 minutes for someone to do that.  Not a place to grab a quick bite.  The food was okay.  The guacamole is good.  We tried the barbacoa, chicken, carne asada and chicken tacos.  The carne asada was dry.  I will probably wait about 6 months and then try again.  Hopefully the service will be better by then.", "Date": "2016-07-29", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Richard", "ReviewID": "WDh-VGh0a8L2934wyjwoNQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Ok good thing I didn't read all of the bad reviews before our party stopped in the other night because we would have really missed a good time!

The bf thoroughly the taco and the house margarita was good enough to keep drinking!  We look forward to going back the next time we are in Vegas.
