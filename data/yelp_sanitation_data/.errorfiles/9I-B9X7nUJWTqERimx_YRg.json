We decided to stop and I am so glad we did. The ribs were delicious and smoked to perfection and the meat was super tender so it pulled right off the bone. The chicken was very moist and full of flavor, and with 3 sides including pit smoked beans, potato salad and dirty rice all for $20 you really can't beat that. We also got his smoke ham and hotlink sandwich, very tasty stuff. It was a one man show and he was able to serve everyone very quickly. We will definitely be coming back, this was the best bbq we have had in las vegas. Best ribs I've ever had!", "Date": "2015-02-07", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "JB", "ReviewID": "M5-_plNDUPa2nJ-QPlvEAg", "Overall": "3", "Content": "We live nearby and drove by for a long time--never saw anyone there and were afraid to try it.  He is in a bad spot; not much traffic on that part of Pebble.  He turned the way the truck sat and increased the lighting which was much better, although we still never saw anyone there.  We finally decided we should stop and show our support.  Prices are not cheap--got the ribs and beans for the side.  He cut the ribs individually most of the way through to make it easier to eat which was nice.  Ribs were really tender but not much seasoning and not much smoke.  BBQ sauce was fine.  Beans were good but way too saucy and the portion was really small.  Truck looked clean inside and set-up was nice and included a table if you wanted to eat there (napkins provided are about as good as Kleenex, come on, you want us to eat ribs, we need something to wipe our hands with).  Owner (I am guessing he was the owner) was really nice.  He needs a better location and distinctive food--it takes a lot of effort for people to try something new and the offerings must be special in order for them to want to come back.  He is there like Weds-Sat 4-8 pm.  We wish him the best!", "Date": "2015-02-03", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
