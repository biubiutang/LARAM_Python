The chicken was juicy, the bacon was crispy and they definitely didn't skimp on the avocado. They also offer a bunch of different sauces.

The staff has always been extremely friendly and the service is very fast.   While I have only ordered their crispy chicken fingers, they also sell grilled fingers which look equally as delicious. Additionally, you get a generous portion of delicious french fries. I don't know what kind of seasoning they use, but it is great.   The only thing that confuses me at PDQ is the multiple dipping sauces you can get with your order. They are all very good and you can get multiple flavors with each order - I just never know how many I can get without paying extra, so I always ask.   Give PDQ a try!

For a fast food restaurant I am extremely impressed!!!! Heard great things about this place so we had to try it. I got the grilled turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce. Very tasty sandwich with a nice meaty lean piece of turkey. Had to get a chicken tender to try and the blueberry cole slaw. Omg the chicken is moist and cooked perfectly with a nice crunch. Wow! The breading on the tender is light and crispy, not dripping in oil and tasting of old yucky oil. I was a little hesitant to try the blueberry coleslaw but wow, yummilicous!!  They have a bunch of cool sauces too! I tried the honey BBQ (Yum). But what blew me away was the fresh-cut fries!!! Holy fries!! Prob one of the best fresh-cut fries I've ever tried!! So well seasoned you don't even need ketchup!! Nice and thin like I like them.   I also want to say that not only does this place serve tasty well-made food, the service was amazing. We ordered our food from the manager Chris who asked if this was our first time. He was so nice and helpful and brought our food to us promptly. At the end of our meal he came over to ask us how we liked it and we of course said Awesome!! Since it was our first time he gave us a cookie of our choice!! Now that's service!!!!

Today, however, has sullied our experience and we will not be back. The manager, Chris, who prepared food for all of my children, did not have any hair net or head covering at all. When I questioned him about it, he stated he didn't have to wear anything. His staff, however, all have head coverings on. Another manager came out to try to talk to me about it and stated Chris was  just helping out . My kids are eating salads, not greasy fried foods that hair just hides in. It's totally skeevy to think that hair just flies all over the food. One manager has 3 feet dreads and no hair cover. The main manage just came over and told me its corporate policy that managers don't wear hair covers. The girl cleaning the bathroom has her hair covered.

And my boyfriends blue cheese dressing was runny and looked like it had been sitting out while my ranch tasted more like a garlic sauce than ranch.

This location is the second one in Vegas with plans to open more according to the staff that assisted me today. Everyone is friendly and attentive to your needs which is rare in a fast food joint.   If you enjoy Raising Canes this is a must try for something different and refreshing approach to chicken fingers. They also make delicious hand spun shake which changes throughout seasons.

If you were to compare it to a competitor, I would say it's on the level of raising canes, although this is personal preference, I like it better. (Cue the Raising Canes fans saying whaaaat?!?!?!)  Why is it better than raising canes?  Because of the menu selection and sauces. Don't be presumptuous and assume every customer wants the same thing. PDQ offers salads and other items that incorporate their chicken. They also offer crispy & grilled chicken  for those seeking variety. There's several sauces to choose from, at no additional charge such as buffalo, bbq, sarichia, blueberry, ranch, & more.   Food quality: we've only ordered the chicken strips crispy with fries and a variety of sauces on the side. The chicken strips are good, crispy, appear to be real chicken, and travel well home. I'm not huge on this style of fries (whole potato w skin, fried but not crispy), so they don't elicit any oohs or aahs from me. But they weren't bad. One day I'll venture out of my comfort zone & try the blueberry coleslaw.  The sauces are what sets this place apart from competitors. My personal fave is the sweet sarichia, second is the bbq. The ranch is a bit too salty. They have a blueberry dipping sauce which had a unique flavor. It was good, but won't be a goto sauce.  Added bonus: You can order extras at no additional cost. I like to get one I like and rotate in a new flavor.   Service: we've only ordered at the drive thru. A person takes your order (in person) at the first window, you pay. Then roll up to the second window for your order. It's quick & the food seems to be fresh.

We waited maybe a minute for food.   I ordered a crispy chicken brioche sandwich. The chicken was definitely very tender and juicy. I'm not the biggest fan of their breading, I actually prefer Cane's breading but that's more of a personal preference thing and not indicative of quality or taste. I do feel the chicken quality is better here than Cane's.   My fiancé had a three piece chicken tender meal and the fries that came with it were definitely fresh cut but they were soft and soggy!

May I point out their lemonade is super tart and exactly how I like it, with more lemon and less sugar. Our food was prepared very fast and we dug in. Everything was awesome, except the slaw but to be fair I prefer creamy slaw's, this was vinegary.  But the honey mustard was awesome! My california club was fantastic till the last bite. The toffee apples made us want to get another order. While we were eating a different manager? Chef? Approached us to check on us and we chatted for a bit. I had to ask how the shakes were, he highly recommended them. He explained there's a special flavor each month. For July it was Orange Creamsicle. For August it's Cocoa Krispies.   After we finished my husband wanted to try a shake, he went with chocolate oreo. I had my eye on the chocolate peanut butter cookie. Both were awesome. We also thouroughly enjoyed a 2nd order of the apple slices!! We were then treated with a cranapple oatmeal cookie by the Chef that was better than the peanut butter IMO.

I was impressed by their bathrooms, you'll see when you go there lol and they have this huge fountain sink at the entrance, perfect for the kiddos to wash hands. The employees are very attentive and constantly clean and ask if you need napkins/sauce. When we were there they had the corn-in-the-hole game (bean bags u throw into a wooden box) for kids/adults to play outside.  As for the food, they're chicken tenders are huge and fresh, lots of sauces to choose from. What really stood out is the buns they use for the sandwiches. I think it's brioche buns, soft and fluffy, fresh baked taste. If u don't want chicken they also got turkey choices too. The fries were better then in-n-out for sure. Food looked fresh and healthy.

My other friend who thinks chicken is just chicken, and can't differentiate, said it's the same - chicken. (Don't even get me started) I also ordered the same thing, but I am still not swayed. I just don't care for the tenders. They are cool, so if a friend wanted to go, I'd probably go back, but not on my own accord.

They really only serve chicken strips on buns or salads or by them self. My second complaint is the terrible name  PDQ  I mean that sounds terrible and then to find out it stands for something like people demanding quality or something along those lines. Kind of lame and doesn't help describe the type of  food on the menu.

It compares to Canes chicken fingers but they have salads and sandwiches as well. Enjoyed the spicy ranch. I only ordered the chicken tenders. My partner has grilled tenders and fried Zucchini.

For an extra dollar, you could add bacon or avocado. I thought about adding both, but decided to just add the avocado. I have a sweet tooth and haven't indulged it that much on this trip.

Love the ambience. (3) value: meals are a little skimpy on the size of the chicken but very generous on the fries (3.5).  There are some serious things to love about PDQ. The best thing is the chicken fingers combination.  Lightly battered and fried, the tenders are especially tender and juicy. Only complaint are the chicken fingers are a bit on the smaller size for the price. The hand cut fries are pretty good as well with their crisp shoestring sized exterior. I have not tried their coleslaw which is a healthier option instead of fries. For a drink, try their lemonade which they have behind the counter. They will happily refill this for you as well. I found it a bit strong but when diluted with lots of ice,  it works well.   We tried their honey bbq and honey mustard sauces which are both pretty good.   If it was just this item alone,  this joint would get 4 stars. However because we tried some other lackluster items which prevent the bump up.   The fried chicken sandwich was okay. Although the chicken is good the ratio of chicken to the bun is way off. (too much bun... not enough chicken) Also when we ordered this,  they never asked what sauce we wanted with it so it was a bit plain when we had it. Definitely ask for sauce!   I tried their grilled chicken salad which albeit edible was pretty mediocre. Their grilled chicken tastes more generic - a bit too tough, dry and salty. The salad tastes like the standard iceberg mix you get from a bag from the grocery store with that slightly dehydrated texture from being cut and sitting in a bag for a while. They go heavy on the blueberry dressing which I found to be overly sweet. I would probably pass on this in the future.   I also tried the crispy chicken salad with the honey mustard dressing. Although the flavoring of the salad is better, it still doesn't even rank up with the chicken fingers combination.  We also tried their brewed iced teas. The green tea had an unpleasant floral tone to it and I cannot recommend it. The brewed iced tea/sweet tea is okay albeit a bit weakly brewed. Probably would be better if you mixed the iced tea with the lemonade and made yourself an Arnold Palmer.   This place is clean and spacious. I love the fact they have a hands free sink outside the bathrooms so you can wash your hands before/after eating.   Service is quick and efficient when it comes out. Ordering does take a few minutes though as they only  have 2 cashiers.   Overall, I like this place -  the fried chicken tender combination is well priced and the sauces are good. I would come back just for that as their other items are decided weaker. 3.5 starred review.", "Date": "2015-07-25", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Robert", "ReviewID": "F3aaZg-Y0RuB9gmKpsw6BQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I don't give out 5 star reviews to just any one.

Keep in mind we are reviewing a fast food restaurant. We are not reviewing Giada on The Strip, frankly some people should be embarrassed that they even attempted to sound as pretentious in their reviews as they do. That is beside the point. Here's the deal:  The selection is great, you can get all sorts of variations of sandwiches, tenders, salads, and sides.   The chicken is fresh, it is well seasoned and not dry. The chicken from here tastes like chicken made with love. Not the hate filled chicken of Chick-Fil-A.   The french fries are deliciously seasoned and well fried. They always come out fresh and crisp. Nothing on earth is better than fresh fries.   Sauces-a-plenty! There is a huge sauce selection that you can keep coming back for more of. They are not stingy and the associates do not act like their job is on the line if they hand over any extra condiments. God forbid a person needs more sauce.   The staff is courteous and friendly and always willing to go above and beyond for you. The food is ready quickly and brought out to you.   Can we talk about the soap they offer by the little wash bin? SMELLS AMAZING.
