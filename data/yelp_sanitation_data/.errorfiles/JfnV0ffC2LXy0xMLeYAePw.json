My friend insists that it's not as good as in LA, but it seemed the same as the ones I've had in Glendale, LA and Seattle. Light crispy shell with vanilla filling, which is all they had tonight - typical Japanese dessert that the custard filling was rich and not sweet.   So I love Beard Papa's but I'd never go back during their obnoxious Tuesday block party. I had to literally yell my order at the cashier. They're filled to order and call your name when it's ready - too bad the music was blasting so loud that I couldn't hear sh*t.   Its summer, and still almost 100Â° at night - guess what, you at least need ceiling fans in Vegas if youre going to have an open spot with no air conditioning. But no worries, they also sell $9 boba snow ice so you'll stay cool with no problem. I'll probably wait it out for this location to close so they can open in a nice air conditioned mall like normal Beard Papa's.", "Date": "2014-06-25", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Emily", "ReviewID": "MdrNw0V2qRBcexxQFaHdwA", "Overall": "3", "Content": "In the area for an event at The Linq and remembered they were offering buy one, get one free original cream puffs.   They are currently only offering vanilla filling so I was stuck with this option, despite knowing I likely wouldn't enjoy it. Vanilla and cream filling isn't my favorite.  They fill as you order and our puffs were ready quickly. The pastry was light and fluffy and, as expected, I didn't enjoy the filling. I know these are supposed to be subtle and not overly sweet, but I find the puffs and filling a little on the sweet side for my taste. I typically like very subtle desserts, so I was surprised that these didn't do it for me. I have tried Beach Papa's before in Southern California and I wasn't in love then either, so maybe it's just me.   I am interested in trying their other flavors when they become available, but for the price and location, I don't see myself making any special effort to give it another try.", "Date": "2014-06-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jasmine", "ReviewID": "YBGYGz75vMnVRQvRy4YBaQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Beard papa is a chain from Japan.

But, come on man!   $3.00 for one Beard Papa's cream puff.   Sorry, but even at Ala Moana Shopping Center, these puffs are only $1.75 for an original size.       I believe the owners of FAME are reading Yelp reviews, because the music wasn't blazing as everyone mentioned.   Also customer service was solid, but looking at these prices at some of the other vendors at FAME, it's pretty understandable that those businesses are either paying a premium for the spot, or there just taking advantage of the location; I like to think it's the first.   In any case, they better do what Brooklyn bowl is doing with their $9.99 lunch specials, or Linq's property management have to cut some of these businesses some slack, and let them grow a local clientele.  Why just a three star?  One, I'm still a fan of Beard Papa, and this gives them a four stars for the product.   On the other hand, I'm looking at 58% mark up for the same great product because it's on the Las Vegas strip,  Wow!   That really don't make any sense, because I don't see the same mark up for Krispy Kream or McD's on Las Vegas Blvd.  Oh well, that gives them a two star for price.

FINALLY! Beard Papa's Has opened up in Las Vegas! Located inside FAME at The Linq, we happened to be there on opening night after the Nerdy Bowling event at Brooklyn Bowl and they were offering 2 for 1 Cream Puffs-SWEET!   I will save some of you the disappointment and say that you won't get rich, in your face sweet, ooey gooey from here....crisp, light, delicately sweet is the best way I can describe a Beard Papa's cream puff, and I love that the shells are filled to order so you can totally enjoy the tastes and textures, so if you didn't think places like Suzuya and Sweets Raku weren't all that, I wouldn't suggest coming here. You have been warned.  This is the first Beard Papa's that I've seen different types of shell being offered too-Original, Cocoa, Cookie Crunch, Paris Brest, and Eclair. I would stick with the original and cocoa shells. I do hope they offer more cream fillings in the future(Green tea, strawberry chocolate and caramel are all bomb!) ALOHA!!!

The 2 for $8 puff deal is a steal if you ask me and certainly the wallet thought so as well!   The puffs themselves were deceptive as at first you give it the  it's not so big  stare and then biting into it you realize  oh man how am I going to finish this whole thing  (don't judge) ha-ha. It was cooked to perfection as it was far from too crispy or soggy and it just pulled apart with ease and melted away like butter! What did tickle my fancy was the filling. I have certainly had my share of custard being a Midwestern boy and this one was money. It was served slightly chilled and was not overly or underly (WOW, take that Merriam Webster) sweet, but was one of the better custards I have consumed to date.

The Vegas location is lacking in variety compared to the Los Angeles Little Tokyo location but having them here sure beats driving to CA for a fix. The cream puff shells are made fresh and only gets filled with the cream upon ordering so that they stay crispy delicious with all the delicate nuances only a freshly baked puff pastry shell can give you. This location had the original, cookie, cocoa and eclair available. Each had its own distinct flavor but if you're new to this I suggest the original as the best way to enjoy it. They also offer  mini  cream puffs if you prefer to enjoy them bite-sized--but be forewarned that you can polish these minis off very quickly without noticing. So the only complaint: please bring more varieties to Las Vegas!", "Date": "2014-07-16", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Kenn", "ReviewID": "cUBiQ_J66544aQfuINxroA", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Finally we have a Beard Papa's location here in Vegas!  This location is pretty new and still don't have the full variation of fillings except vanilla and hazelnut. Combine that with original, cocoa or cookie housing that completes the cream puff.  BUUUUUUUUT, it didn't taste like their original cream puff. I knew their locations in Tokyo and San Francisco, but this one was inconsistent with my long time previous experiences. The cream was way whipp-y and less custard-y. The Beard Papa's signature cream should be custard-rich flavor!  Also, while I appreciate the vanilla cream not being too sweet, it went a bit too far to the point where it could be called tasteless. However, the sweetness of the hazelnut cream was decent, so hopefully we were just unlucky to catch an inconsistent batch of the day, it was not their new direction. I'll have to reconfirm.  As with anything on the Strip, FAME (an Asian-oriented food court at the Linq) is open through midnight so we were able to stop by and have a quick bite at 11pm. That's a big plus.  However, three cream puffs with two plain ice teas for $25 seems pricy. I don't mind paying $$$$ for a fine dining, but do mind when I know the original price of a cream puff is less than $2 per piece, and the reasonable pricing constitutes a significant part of the brand. Just because it's on the strip doesn't mean you will pay $100 for a GAP t-shirt. Markup by novelty will quickly degrade as the brand becomes more known. As with anything, pricing it right is the key for a sustainable business - plan accordingly.  All that said, I very much welcome this new location. I hope you guys thrive.", "Date": "2014-06-29", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Bronsen", "ReviewID": "ip456eejIY-VxZRG1YO-LA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Finally got to try the coveted Beard Papa's cream puff!! ...well, the Vegas version at least.  I have heard about this place from one of my Cali friends and was interested in giving it a go when it opened.  Lucky for me, today was the day it opened and I got to walk in and try one of these bad boys out.  I opted for the 'Cookie' version of their cream puff and was delighted with the amount of cream in it.  There's a lot in there.. I mean A LOT. It was oozing all over my hand and onto the napkin, bursting out with creamy deliciousness.  The outer layer of the cream puff was tough and a little too rigid for my liking.  It wasn't anything like a Liliha Bakery cocoa puff where the puff was just fluffy and soft and easy to devour. No, no.. it took a few well adjusted bites to put the puff pastry down at Beard Papa's and just wasn't what I was expecting as far as having a  puff -like exterior. However, I think for what it is, the flavors work very well together and the cream.. well, that's pretty much the best part about it hands down.  I like the fact that they had some beer and wine on tap (esp. Kirin and Sapporo for you Japanese beer lovers) and they also had some boba, to boot. I'll be back to venture out to the other flavors the next time I take a stroll through The Linq.", "Date": "2014-06-25", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Sarah", "ReviewID": "NLfYNgC13WwTBf9WGqPryQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Just as good as the stand alone Beard Papa's shops you'll find in California!

The pastry is light and airy with the exterior being nice and flaky and the original vanilla filling is not overly sweet.  Perfect for those with Asian dessert tendencies.  The two stars missing are due to the chaotic service.  It took 15 minutes to get our order.  Other people who ordered after us were receiving their orders first, since they don't seem to have a good system track and fill orders.  The other really annoying part is that the music in FAME is so loud, the cashiers can barely hear the orders.  The flavors they currently have are original, cocoa, cookie, and eclair style.

I wouldn't mind giving green tea and hazelnut a go but not this time. I got the eclaire (chocolate dipped original) a coco and a cookie with vanilla filling. Lets start with the cookie. It  had bits of cookie all over the pastry and the cookie bit tasted good. it wasn't filled all the way and had almost 50% air inside the puff pastry and was a little let down. I read sok reviews that said it was filled with alot of filling so I was expecting the same. With that said all of the three cream puffs I got was filled the same and to me was not filled enough. the vanilla cream had a very light taste but it had a good consistency and good texture. the puff itself was made well and held the filling as it should. we then had the eclaire. it was go was go the chocolate added what seemed as a missing flavor if it had any and was a nice semisweet and not so much sugar it hurts your teeth chocolate. Then the coco puff. it was a coco puff with vanilla filling and I am glad I saved that one for last as it was the best one. the coco puff had great chcocolate flag and with the vanilla filling was a good combo. The workers were nice and greeted us and was very easy to talk to. Overall it is an ok cream puff, if I am in the area I would stop in to see if they have anymore flavors for the day besides vanilla but I dont think I'll be making a special trip just for these anything soon, unless they bring the sweet potatoes one here then ill be back lol!", "Date": "2014-08-11", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
