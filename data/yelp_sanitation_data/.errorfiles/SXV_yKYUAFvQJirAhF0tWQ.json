I go with my family all the time for lunch or dinner. Very clean and good service. I got the pita and humus with Tahiti as an appetizer, and the lamb-beef gyro as an entree. Absolutely delicious!! The meat in the gyro is sliced thinly, and very, very tender, so it's easy to eat! The pita bread is very soft, but crispy on the outside. Perfect texture!! I also recommend the coconut shrimp, even though it isn't exactly Greek. It's better than most sea food restaurants! I haven't been there at night, but I've heard it can get pretty crazy. The only things that kept this from getting a five star were the somewhat cheesy decorating and really big menu. Honestly, there's no reason why a Greek restaurant should be selling burgers and coconut shrimp.", "Date": "2015-03-01", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ophir", "ReviewID": "iuFSIG258PR4mXDcSwze4Q", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Beautiful restaurant like if a freakin greek temple was a dance club.

We went for lunch around 1:00 or so. Felt very rushed from the time we were seated until the time we got up. When our server walked up to our table, all she said was  You ready?  We'd just sat down, so we quickly put in our drink order and told her we needed a few minutes. She came back right away while we were still looking over our menus and said it again,  You ready?  If we would have gotten the server that was waiting on the table next to us, it would have been a very nice overall experience. She was helpful with the menu, gave menu options, pleasantly took special requests and didn't rush the patrons whatsoever. We got the opposite. Not helpful with the menu at all and made us feel like we needed to hurry. Everything came out together. Including our side salads. Since it had been a while for our food to come out, I figured she'd at least ask if we wanted her to bring out the hummus or side salads before our meal. I would have overlooked that but overall she was rude. At the end of our quick lunch, she stood there staring at my plates, basically rushing me, when I was putting my unfinished food in my take home box. She should have come back for the plates when I was done or offered to plate it for me if she was in such a hurry to take the plates away. I wasn't being slow. She also saw that we needed more than one take home box but didn't seem to care that I was putting it all together in one box. So since she was just standing there staring, I took that as an opportunity to ask her for another box. She came back and still just stood there waiting for my plate. As far as  you ready  and not asking what choices we wanted as our sides, either she doesn't speak English very well or just didn't care to take the time, or both. She was also wiping and blowing her nose behind the bar without washing her hands. I watched her just walk off after she threw her wadded up tissue in the trash. She was just plain rude. Maybe we'll see if we can request our server the next time we go.   Our food was great. Piping hot and fresh. Ordered from the lunch menu. Hubs enjoyed the beef and lamb gyro. I had the hummus and pita (I went easy on the pita. It was hard not to eat more than I did) and I also had the stuffed grape leaves. If I wasn't watching my waist line I would have welcomed on the numerous warm soft pita strips. From what I've read on Yelp, they continue to fill the basket. They're soo good but I still went easy. Same with the generous amount of creamy sauce topped with capers that came on the grape leaves. I enjoyed some of it but mostly ate around it. Next time, I'll ask for sauce on the side or just easy on the sauce. The rice was perfect. The side salad was nice. It was all very good. Since it was lunch and I'm going easy with my portions, I ate a small amount of everything. Therefore, I had an entire meal to take home. They really do give you large portions. Ladies, if you're you're eating light and are going there with your girlfriends, it would be easy to order hummus and split an entree and be completely satisfied.

The food lived down to my expectations once again.  I picked up take out for the family.  I ordered Mousaka, Spanakopita, Dalmades, Gyro Platter, Tarmosalada, and a seaweed salad. (pardon the spellings).  The Mousaka was the best of the plates and I'd rate it as barely average, but at least it was hot which was better than the last time I ate in the restaurant.  The Spanadopita was soggy with an unpleasant aftertaste, the Dalmades were way too salty and uneatable, The Gyro Platter was good but lacking on the meat, the Tarmosalada was fairly tastless and reminded me more like mayo, and the seaweed salad was actually quite tasty.

This is a full service, sit down Mad Greek location (unlike the one in Primm). Thus, the menu has some additional offerings. And it was those additional offerings that brought me here.  It's at the end of a strip mall with a cute patio. Inside is a strange mix between overload of Greek decor, hominess, and just a touch of a dive feel. It looks like the kind of place that might be cool and hopping on a weekend night once it's dark outside and there's live music and dancing happening.  The staff were nice and friendly. But the one reason we came here was a complete letdown. I love love LOVE saganaki. And I have yet to find somewhere in Vegas that offers it. Well, turns out this Mad Greek location (and not the one in Primm) does offer it. Hooray! We eagerly ordered it. And then we waited and waited and waited. It was quite a long wait for saganaki. And when it finally comes out, the waitress is unable to light it on fire. Say what?  Oh sometimes, it doesn't work.  She was clearly confused and at first acted like she was going to take it back and fix it or get another one. But nope, she ended up leaving it. Leaving us pondering the question, is it really saganaki if it's not lit on fire? And before we could even begin to eat it, out rolls another order of saganaki for a table that was sat maybe 5 minutes prior. Clearly, our order got lost in the shuffle somehow (and there were only 3 other tables in the place). And, of course, the same waitress is able to light their's on fire. So we proceed to eat our non-fire saganaki. It's blackened on the bottom with no crisp on the sides or top. And it rather lacked any flavor. I didn't even want to eat it after the first couple of bites.  So while there may be some other delicious menu items here. And the ambiance was enjoyable enough. And the staff were friendly.

I am on a quest for the best gyro in town!  I've been to the Mad Greek a few times this summer and I am glad I did.  Before then over a year ago I was at this location and we had some bad experiences.  The server got our order wrong and then proceeded to lie to my wife that it WAS what she ordered when it in fact wasn't.  They couldn't keep their story straight and someone else acknowledged that it was wrong and gave it to us on the house and ordered the right thing for her.  After that experience we stayed away for a while.  I'm all for giving it another try after time has passed and I'm glad we did.  The first time in a while that we went, it was on a Wednesday and it was kind of late.  We sat outside  and it was pretty dark.  The blue lights they usually had on wasn't on.  No matter - we were there for the food!  I ordered the Gyro Plate which had beef & lamb with tzatziki sauce, an unlimited supply of pitas and for dessert we shared a  bomba  which is like two hard-shelled scoops of ice cream.   It was very good!  The last time I was here was very fun! They have live music on Friday and Saturday nights.  I am not going to lie. The live music was SO CHEESY!  So cheesy in fact, that I thought I was in a Napoleon Dynamite movie.  But because the music was like that, I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!  Seriously! I had a great time.  We sat outside again and they had the blue lights on this time.  Only bad thing was that the table we sat at didn't have a burning candle. :P  Our server was very attentive and we got our orders taken quickly and our food as well.  For an appetizer I ordered the dolmades and it was exquisite.  For the main course I ordered the Onassis Burger.  Delicious!  It was like a large cheeseburger topped with pastrami.  We also had free pita bread that we ate with the sauce from the dolmades.   My wife ordered the greek salad (the big one) and it was HUGE!  Next time we come, she said she would order the smaller one.  The waitress girl asked her the question earlier  are you sure you want the bigger one?   Now we know why she did.  And to top off the meal we each had our own order of bomba.  It was $5 each, but oh-so-worth-it.   I loved everything about that night. I had a great time and the food was great.  Our waitress was great.  The only negative thing is that sitting out side is kind of ghetto.  All the cars driving by the smiths, the pedestrian traffic, the crazy drivers and neighborhood idiots sure know how to make themselves known.

I went early in the afternoon on a weekday and although I was one of maybe six other patrons in the restaurant at the time, the place smelled strongly of cigarette smoke. I may not have even noticed this if it was in the evening as cigarette smoke is not uncommon in Las Vegas, however I found it odd that the restaurant was so large and empty yet the smoke was so strong.   The menu HUGE but it's very cluttered and thereby overwhelming. Most of the foods on the menu either lack a description or the description is very vague, so if you've never had Greek food before, this may not be the place to start.   I ordered my food to-go and the hostess (who was very sweet) even offered me a drink while I looked at the menu. The food didn't take long to come out and it was all packed in a plastic bag.   When I got home with my food, I noticed the bag was wet. I opened it and saw that the tzatziki sauce I ordered was extremely watery (the consistency was somewhere in betwen Italian salad dressing and ranch salad dressing) and was spilling out of a styrofoam to-go box. I found this to be very odd that they would pack a sauce/dip in a standard to-go box. It seems like common sense that it would spill out of it and should probably be packaged in some sort of plastic container with a lid.  Overall, I'd say the food was decent. If I lived closer to it, I might stop in once a while to satisfy a craving for Greek food.

The bonus was my Restaurant.com certificate.  I would have loved to sit in the patio, but it was too chilly.  Have they not heard of patio heaters?  With all the renovation that went on here, you'd think they could have run over to Costco and bought a few of 'em.  But nooooo.  There was one measly gas-fed fire pit in the center of a table.  It had a real log burning, but the remaining table space wouldn't have been big enough for any plates.  So we sat inside.  Black and white marble tile floors are surrounded by white walls and those big industrial heating ducts painted in Greek Isles blue.  I could have been on Mykonos - or Israel.  Same colors.  We waited a long time for someone to take our drink orders.  We were just ordering coffee, but it took forever to arrive.  Mine - the high test version - was room temp, so I sent it back.  But it wasn't replaced until we managed to snag a waiter, which would have been easier if just one of us had a cane with a big hook.  Our waiter kept flying by so fast that it was almost necessary to trip him to get his attention.  Three of us decided to share an order of saganaki, a Greek salad, and the 17-item appetizer assortment.  The fourth, on a special diet, ordered grilled salmon.  The salmon came out charred, dried out and overcooked, and she had to send it back.  The replacement was okay, but nothing to write home about.  She said it tasted like it had enjoyed a lengthy vacation in the freezer.  The saganaki was blah.  It tasted to me like fried fish.  Not to the others, but they didn't like it, either.  The Greek salad was very nice, but was a little stingy on the feta.    The appetizer platter is said to serve two people, but with the other stuff we ordered, it was too much for us three.  It was uneven:  the calamari were terrible:  soggy, too chewy, and not hot enough.  The gyro meat was way too salty for me, but then, everything always is.  It also had decent tabbouli, eggplant salad, beef sausage, ground kebab meat, but mediocre hummus, a completely charred pepper, and two boring chicken wings.  The food wasn't bad enough to say that I'd never return, but it sure needs some improvement.  The patio is definitely a plus, hence the extra star.  But it will have to be much warmer to get me back to this place.  The best part came at the end.  With the coupon, the whole food experience cost the three of us who shared the meal just $10 each, and that's including the 18% gratuity that was added on.  And the waiter regaled us each with a piece of baklava to take home, which was a very nice touch, considering we'd spent so little.

Then you see if the food matches the decor. In my opinion of all the Greek places I have eaten...Yes. The gyro is a culinary invention  like the Chicken Tikka and Pizza. A vertical spit that is openly displayed at other cheap Greek places (like the rotating spectrum in barber shops) is hidden.  It is the best gyro I had, (other than  Nicks Gyro  on Touhy and Harlem, in Park Ridge, Illinois.) The Gyro is well done, the pita bread crisp not soggy, right amount of onion and the zatiziki sauce...oh the sauce. How did mankind exist without this sauce? The taste is just out of this world specially gulped down with a Greek red wine not beer (beer tends to fill you up and takes where as a chilled red wine before and during the meal is better for the digestion.)

Hubby had their famous Oscar burger that comes with pastrami on it, which was dry.   The little salad that came with the meal seemed to have a cup of dressing on it. Yikes!

Heard the Happy Hour was back on. Got a great seat on the patio near one of the fountains. Now in the daylight, the patio decor may seem somewhat gaudy but it is shady and comfy.  At night it is a lot prettier.  It could be the perfect place to hang out.  Unfortunately the food & drinks leave so much to be desired and I so wanted to fall back in love with The Mad Greek since changing from The Golden Greek.  We ordered the Saganaki.  The cheese did not have the same taste as before and although the server lit it on fire in front of us, it was still hard in the middle. The hummus and pita were good. The fried zucchini and greek fries were good when hot-we got them barely warm and the tzatziki sauce was average.  We also ordered the shrimp cocktail, goat cheese flambe and a phyllo pastry with cheese insde were good.  The service was slow as far as the food was concerned but the servers themselves were attentive.  Given their attentiveness the rate of food coming from the kitchen must have been due to the kitchen and not a fault of the servers.  Our first server was new and was quick to tell us when she was unable to answer our questions BUT she went to go find out! How rare is that these days?  We started off with pomegranite martinis.  Yuck.  All I tasted was vodka and it was not worth $8.00.  Same for the mango mojito.  Too sweet-did not even finish.  My husband ordered cheesecake and my friend ordered the tiramisu.  They agreed that the desserts were average & most likely not homemade-nothing that a cheaper Sara Lee could not satisfy.

It looks like a hodgepodge of everything Greek, white, and blue with a bare bones table setting. NOT impressive.  Our waitress forgot to give us two menus, silverware, and napkins. We ordered iced tea, and it turns out it's some kind of passion fruit tea even though it isn't listed as such. Menu looks like a mess, too. Makes it feel less like a reputable restaurant. We finally gave up on figuring out what to order and just had calamari to snack on. It was good calamari, but not good enough to warrant coming back just for them. I think the only part I really enjoyed was the ample basket of toasted pita bread that came with it.  Not to mention, the patronage is odd. We sat between a table of very old people in suits and a table of head-to-toe tattooed gangsters sipping a strawberry shake with whipped cream. Picture that. It was worth a laugh.

When we found out it wasn't the place, we decided to eat here instead. We were starving and noticed that they had a 50% off appetizers during happy hour and we were right on time for happy hour.   The restaurant itself was decorated in a gaudy style with murals of the Acropolis and other Greek style architecture on the walls and ceilings. They have a full sized bar which during HH, all drinks are discounted, even non-alcoholic ones.  We hadn't looked at yelp prior to visiting obviously, but after our meal, I managed to look at the reviews on here and the other reviewers were spot on regarding the book of the menu. The listings are really confused with Japanese and Italian offerings as well -- namely, sashimi and pasta.  We stuck to the appetizer menu which consists of cold appetizers and hot appetizers -- taking up 3 pages.  Taramosalata -- this wasn't bad but the taste of caviar did not come through  Melanzanasalata -- or something like that  -- eggplant dip. This was nice and had a tart finish  Spanokopita -- FAIL! The Trader Joe's version is far better. It was obvious that they had originally baked it and then when someone orders it, they popped it into the deep fryer to heat it up. Totally disgusting!!  Falafel -- not grainy but rather, mushy and very dense! I didn't like these much  Dolmas -- their version had meat and rice inside instead of just rice. There is also this creamy-ish white sauce on it which didn't enhance these at all. Pass!  Greek pizza -- pretty awful even the young man didn't want to eat it. We took it back to the hotel but no one even attempted to eat it so we ended up throwing it away.   Greek cheese and olive plate -- this was a winner. We liked this one a lot. Two types of cheeses were offered along with Kalamata olives.  Did I think the food was good? Not particularly. But some items weren't bad, the rest, just plain awful. If I had to pay full price I'd definitely tell you to pass! It's not worth it. However, at 50% off, our bill was actually quite reasonable for what we ate. I was even able to overlook some of the grosser items. Hubby had two drinks, one alcoholic and a Greek cherry juice. I had an iced tea. Our bill? About $40. Now double it and you're looking at $80.

I really wanted to like this place. My brother's wife's mother owns a restaurant called the Mad Greek, which is a fabulous place. I thought for sure, any place that shares the name would share the food and atmosphere. I guess I was mistaken.  So before I walk in I look at the sign to see if they were open. The sign was off, so I probably should have taken the hint and left, but I decided to go in anyway. I am greeted by a waiter, who is in the middle of taking someone's order, and who I cannot seem to understand. I just end up walking out to the patio area because it seemed like fresh air would be nice. Well fresh air mixed with smoke would have to do.  So a minute or two later, the waitress comes up and gives me the menu to look at and takes my drink order. When she comes back I immediately order an appetizer, the baba ganoush. She seems totally clueless as to what I just ordered and nearly yanks the menu out of my hands so she can take it with her because she needs it to remember the order. I know, WTF?  The baba ganoush comes nearly immediately. My guess is that they have it premade and just slap it on a dish and go. I tell the waitress that I need a minute to decide for my entree. It turns out that I need a minute equates to don't come and check on me for literally 20 minutes! In fact I don't see the waitress again until after my order comes back, so instead I end up flagging down the bus boy who luckily came out to clean up the table of the only other group that was out on the patio.   I ask him to get the waitress, but he insists that he can take my order, in very broken English I can barely understand. I tell him my order and he is sounds confused. So I point to the two items on the menu. The guy still seems a little clueless, but walks off repeating the order to himself, only to return moments later. He has a pen, highlights menu items I ordered, and takes the menu with him. At this point I'm really unsure if I'll even be getting what I ordered if neither the waitress nor the bus boy can remember very simplistic orders.  After all is said and done, the food was not very appetizing. I ate little but the baba ganoush (which was decent) and I ended up taking the okra home. I told the waitress not to box the soup that I hardly touched. So she asks,  Didn't you like it?  At that point I was kind of dumbfounded. Why else would I ask NOT to take it home. It was that atrocious. Do I have to spell it out?  Now that I see the other reviews I don't feel so horrible giving this place one star. It seems there is a consensus on this place.

For years, every trip to Cali has included a stop at this historic and amazing restaurant, and it has never failed to please.  Massive, wonderfully thick milkshakes, mouthwatering well spiced gyro meat, AMAZING cheeseburgers, the best fried zucchini you've ever tried.  The original location in Baker is out of this world...  So when they started opening them right here in Vegas, it's needless to say that I was THRILLED...and then I ate here, at the location on Sahara.  I don't know who trained these cooks, but they must love their spices.  I've had Thai food that wasn't this spicy.  I ordered a Gyro, a Cheeseburger, an order of Fried Zucchini, and 2 milkshakes for my wife and I.    The gyro and cheeseburger both got thrown away after about 2 bites because they were somehow lacking flavor while at the same time being too spicy to eat.  I really have no idea how they managed it.  The zucchini was slimy and limp.  the milkshakes were the only part of the meal that we finished, and while being better than average, they were nowhere near the foodgasm experience that I am willing to drive 2 hours to enjoy.  They call this the Mad Greek...Their name is the same.  Their menu is mostly the same.  Their prices are about the same.  Their decor is the same.  Their food is NOT.  If you are an avid Mad Greek fan from way back, do not come here expecting the food that you know and love from that California gem.    This place embodies why so many restaurants fail when they try to expand into additional locations.  The quality suffers and they lose their regulars.  As much as I love the idea of having one close to home, I'll wait for my next trip to go back to the original.

I agree with some of the others.  The food was overpriced and could have been better.  My theory is that they are trying to improve flavor with salt, (like in the stuffed grape leaves) and sugar, (the strawberry shake.)  If they want to charge higher prices, they need to improve the flavor with a balance of ingredients, and the sugar or salt shouldn't dominate. Most people can see through over salting and over sweetening.  Also the chicken gryo on the salad was overcooked and greasy.  It was almost woody.  The Greek salad was good, but you can get those anywhere these days.  The albondigas soup was also very good, but for those prices you expect everything to be memorable and top notch.  Five dollars for a pot of tea sort of makes you feel like a sucker.   The music was loud, and the decor was fun.  it would be a nice place to go to celebrate a special occasion if you could get your money's worth.  We were there at 9:00 at night.

At first and after checking some of the reviews I got a little confused and hesitant because I know my friend is into fresh, healthy, and great food. To make the long story short I agreed to try it........  We got there about 8:00 P.M. The place was pretty busy for a Super Bowl Sunday. We were greeted immediately and with the most upbeat, welcome, and respectful way. We ordered Octopus, Greek salad, Saganaki to start and, for the main course, the Lavraki fish with Horta (dandelions).  Greek salad and Saganaki (flaming Greek cheese) was very good.  Octopus, out of this world.  Lavraki fish with Horta (Dandelions) was amazing, fresh and cooked to perfection!  I could not resist to order Galaktoboureko for dessert. Like my mom's.   Perhaps most noteworthy, besides the truly exceptional food and service we received from Irena, Elena, Rodney and the owner Michael, was the Music and Movie History on the walls, such as:   (Michael  Mikis  Theodorakis who is one of the most internationally famous Greek songwriter of over 1000 songs and composer.

We came early, based on other yelp reviews I was excited to try out the happy hour menu. The waitress hands us the most confusing menu I've ever seen. There's a space with a piece of paper with new menu items taped over one section, and black sharpie crossing things out.  I did not see the happy hour menu, so when I asked our waitress about it she explained that they no longer serve happy hour because they've updated their menu with lunch specials. I found this was strange. Service over all was okay, but the waitress seemed a bit confused.  On to the horrible! Bacon wrapped shrimp-4 tiny pieces of charcoal were delivered to us. Shrimp1 looked burnt but as I bit close to the tail it was frozen, shrimp 2 was burnt on the outside raw on the inside. Obviously the cook took frozen shrimp, wrapped bacon sound it, and put it under the broiler until it was burnt, thinking the shrimp would be cooked. Babbaganosh- This was okay, not the best I've ever had. But the only thing we readily ate. Meat (?) pita- not sure if this was beef or lamb since we were never asked  what meat we wanted, but again it was thrown under a broiler and over cooked so it really didn't matter what kinda of meat it was. Everything else on the platter was average. Ground beef with cheese- I don't remember what this was called on the menu. I was not asked how I wanted it cooked, and it was of course extra well done and burnt outside. The seasoning and meat was tender and good, they need to serve this meatball style.

We couldn't believe it when a 3rd party walked in and they were greeted, sat, given water, AND got their orders taken within 5 minutes of walking through the door.  We were there sitting idle for a good 10-15 minutes before we decided to spend our hard earned cash elsewhere.

I went with the grill plate - a mountain of meats with seasoned rice. While I wasn't a fan of the meatballs, every other item on the platter was delicious. Finished off with a couple of glasses of wine and you've got a very happy fat kid.

We would either stop on the way from Vegas or on our way back to Vegas.   Naturally we had to check this restaurant out since it had the same name and the same infamous fresh strawberry shake. In the past year that we have discovered this place we have been here numerous times for dinner, cocktails and their wonderful happy hour.   Between their fair pricing on their food, their personable staff and their knack for accommodating children, I have to say that I have grown to really love this place. Happy Hour is my favorite time to go, its for a couple of hours between 4pm - 6pm and offers great HH prices on drinks (beer, wine and mixed drinks) and has a pretty good tapas-esque HH menu. I was here recently for happy hour with my 2 year old son and my girlfriend. Neither of us had any cocktails but we ordered quite a bit from the tapas menu. I always start with a HH sized Greek salad, its my favorite, so full of flavor including olives and tons of feta. I order the Greek fries with feta for my son who loves french fries (these are more like home-style fries,) and the spanikopita (spinach and cheese filled phyllo dough.) My friend ordered the coconut shrimp, a small Greek salad and the goat cheese flambe (which was not en flambe lol.) We shared everything we had and it was ALL so yummy!  We were all full and the bill came out to be about $30 or so. You really cannot beat that price for all the food we got.   One of the other reasons I like coming to the Mad Greek is how kid-friendly they are. Every time we are there the employees light up when they see my son and my son equally lights up when he sees the Mad Greek sign. After every meal they always ask if its ok to give him an ice cream sundae and always check to make sure he is a happy camper. The Greek has a dance floor with a stage for the times they do live music (which is GREAT!) and my son loves to get on that dance floor and show his moves off - they all love it.   Make sure to sit outside when the weather is a bit warmer, the patio is (as other reviewers have stated) in a parking lot but it is closed off and has a great ambiance, especially at night with the heat lamps and the fire pit. The Mad Greek is often on Restaurants.com and getting a certificate is a great way for a first timer to try out the restaurant.

There were five other parties in the patio area and two servers ignored us for nearly 1/2 hour.  The other tables were being attentively served.  We weren't offered water, an explanation of being acknowledged or a reason for having to wait.  WE WERE IGNORED.  So, we left and went to another nearby favorite of ours and spent at least $100.  On our way out, we were waved good-bye to by at least a 1/2 dozen employees hanging out in the indoor dining room....with no customers.  Understand, we eat out a couple of times a week, have many family members who regularly come into town for visits, and co-workers we actively recommend our favorite hangouts to.  We are also fans of family-owned/local restaurants and wouldn't be caught dead in the big chains.

They are $4 each and okay. The gyro meat is standard fare. However, you will have to experience an explosion of Greek decor and an equally massive menu. The mere size of the menu leaves you concerned that things can't be too fresh, and for me, it has a psychological effect. Can they really serve up the best steak, freshest fish and Greek egg rolls done right?    The seemingly low prices trick you into ordering a lot more and before we knew it we had spent a little over $40. I tried the babaganoush, and despite big hunks of eggplant, I thought it was fair. The pita was what I would describe as the white bread equivalent of pita, thick and doughy, which can be good, but I appreciate a lighter pita.  Our server was nice even though she did forget to bring our drinks until after the first round of food had hit the table.

They should call this place The Bad Greek. Actually, maybe the name is a warning...  if you arrive here a happy Greek once you try our terrible food you will leave a Mad Greek .  I don't know who is back there making the food, but the cook should be sent to live with the Turks in Cyprus for being so impressively bad at being Greek. Maybe this place was opened by a Turkish housewife as a passive-aggressive jab at the Greeks. I could sit and do nothing but speculate all day as to how these people got so truly terrible at life, but then I would get hungry eventually, which might cause me to need to eat more of their crappy food.  Kidding aside, we Greeks are a very hungry people.  If you are luring starving Greeks to your establishment, the most important thing you should know is that eating is not a joke to us.  So don't burn the freaking spanakopita.  Especially if you didn't even bother to put more than a half teaspoon of filling in it... ESPECIALLY if one of the minuscule four burnt  spinach pie  nibblets doesn't even have the correct filling in it!!!  Did someone drop some jam in there?  Why was it sweet??  And why did the nibblets consist of almost nothing but burnt phyllo dough?!  This I do not like. This is merely a reminder of what could have been.  Everything else was mediocre at best... Pre-made cheap Italian dressing on my Anatolia salad that you can't call a  salata  unless you want to confuse them. Dolmades piled sloppily under a sea of bland mystery sauce, loosely rolled as though they were Taco Bell burritos, filled with unvarying smoosh and what appeared to be instant rice. Pre-crumbled feta... WTF?  Are they really so lazy that they cringe at the prospect of clasping their hand a few times to break up some blocks of feta?!  None of this should matter to any Greek reading this... Because they had the audacity to serve me badly burnt spanakopita with no filling.
