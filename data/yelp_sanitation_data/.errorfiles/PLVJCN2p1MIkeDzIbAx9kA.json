Lunch was good. Food was good and fries were good. Got the bill and found that there was an extra charge for the fries. I asked the waitress if fries were not included with my meal. She said they were but the seasoned fries were extra. I asked her why she did not tell me it was more. She said her manager told her she was not allowed to tell the customers the seasoned fries were extra. She said that the added fee was the one thing she could not say. She showed me on another page of the menu that the fries are extra in price. I said I see it now but it is not anywhere near the senior menu. Just saying. My opinion when steering customers off their order you should tell them there is an added fee if there is one.

Yes, what a relief when a Hispanic family came in later and the hungry noisy well-dressed kids are eager to eat after services from church.

We order our food and it finally comes out and my order got mixed up with another person at our table. I ordered plain pancakes and she got the pumpkin sauce pancakes. they put pumpkin on both orders of pancakes.i let it slide and tried it out thinking it might be good and I hate sending my food back.I was not going to wait another 10 minutes for new pancakes. it was absolutely disgusting btw.considering I'm 8 months pregnant I was trying to be home and In bed by 2am because i had a doctors appointment in the morning, I didn't get home until almost 3. Worst denny's trip ever and i wish i would have gotten the waiters name. only thing i can tell you is he had glasses and i think it was tuesday the 18th @1am. we love the dennys itself and Will be returning of course ,just not when that man is there. we have never had an issue with any other waiter/waitress on our late night trips.", "Date": "2016-10-25", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Kim", "ReviewID": "GDgWw8253IqnJEU12LepWA", "Overall": "1", "Content": "I did not experience terrible customer service today nor was the food bad.

I used to work here, and I can tell you that everything is very clean, and the staff is well-trained.  Something to try: The strawberry lemonade. It's lemonade with strawberry preserves blended into it (comparable to cheesecake factory).  When people ordered it, I used to just bring them a carafe (free refills, so no extra charge), because everyone always wanted at least 4 refills. Something to watch for: Ordering 2 eggs, toast, and bacon will cost you A LOT more than ordering the combo. A new server might not know that they have a combo that includes what you're ordering, and might input the items separately, if you order them that way.   Something to avoid: Complicated orders.  Hate to say it, guys, but the cooks here very rarely speak perfect English.  It's very difficult to make them understand the special requests.  Either way, if you want your breakfast cooked on a separate griddle, with  just a splash of grape seed oil  because you have a  sensitive stomach  you really shouldn't be eating at Denny's in the first place.

I appreciated that Victor was knowledgeable and  recommended I try the 2 4 6 8 value meal  to accomplish my task being sensitive to my request about portion control and even managed to save me some money in the process.  I had no idea that it was the middle of a shift change as these gentlemen all assisted me  in the most professional  and careful  manner possible.

He and Victor manage to drop my order with the chef, bring me a drink while I waited, and  entertained me without missing a Beat. Even the chef was in an upbeat mood and although I didn't get his name he acknowledge me  and got my order out faster than I expected. Zane even brought a personal touch to his ability to serve me when he politely recommended that I try the designer dessert cinnamon drizzle that they had available on my French toast. I even got to sample it before having it on my food and it was fantastic!! It brought a warm cinnamon bun flavor to the French toast that perfectly complemented it without being overly sweet.

I am mourning the demise of the Baconallia menu. Fear not I was allowed to have the Bacon Brownie, are you kidding me? Now of course once they run out of the materials, then its really over, but the point is (not only to create a horribly structured run on sentence) but to let you know that the staff and especially the night manager, will go the extra mile to make the customer happy, sadly a rarity in this day and age.

I thought I'd hit a few more during the day.  I drove to 2 other locations before I stopped in here. This promotion publicized very well. Alot of people must haved called in and every senior on the planet was in line for some grub.  This time around I took the free grand slam but I also ordered some Hashbrowns and toast. I decided to be bold and order my eggs sunny side up-what the hell their free so if they fail no biggie.  I was very impressed-my eggs were perfect-the hashbrowns slightly crispy and my toast was not burnt.  This one was much better than the 1st but the refills were a little slow coming and this place wasn't nearly as busy as the others.  Well after being completely egged out for the day we both got some cheesecake for dessert. They have 3 new flavor-we tried turtle & raspberry. Incredible for a fast food diner.

I have to say the experience was horrible!!! There was only one server, the manager and two guys in the kitchen. We got out order all messed up, the waitress said the grill person was new and we didn't mind at all, we understood and said it was fine. Food was neither good or bad, very average. The problem was the waitress' attitude towards her coworkers, she started yelling at them saying that the order was all messed up and blah blah blah, then she started yelling to the manager that she needed help and that she was about to leave; it was so uncomfortable to be there, the manager went to our table to ask what else we were missing and I could see that she was about to cry. The waitress wasn't rude at us but it was really awful to see the way she acted in front of the customers. Two or more people actually left the place before even ordering.

Still one of the cheapest joints around - although it appears that's for a reason.  But hey - it's Denny's so I won't thrash them too hard.

And this is the one that stood out...well not specifically this location, but a server we had one morning. This lady was AWESOME!!! I can't for the life of me remember her name though. I don't even know if she still works there, but if she does you have to hunt her section down!! She is the most motherly, loving, sweetest lady I've ever met!! She immediately greets you as you sit down and gets your drink order. She even offers suggestions if you're not sure. She includes with her service a good dousing of  honeys, sweeties, dolls  too. I know some people hate being called that...but you'll immediately fall in love with her gushing over you. She repeats your order to you, jokes with you and is always smiling. And she always checks on you. She even knows when you're slowing down and will immediately ask if you need a box. The icing on this wonderful experience is that she brought out our drinks in TO GO cups so we could have something to drink on the road!! I was floored...shoot...I still am! Her service was sooo outstanding I think we tipped her what our bill came out to be.
