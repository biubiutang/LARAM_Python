Had a party of 9 people a few nights ago. They had a set menu for $45 which we were never told about. We found out about it on the way out from a sign that was tucked away. Our waiter was slow considering about half the restaurant was filled. The food is I ridiculously priced for the restaurant. Entrees start at about $30. I got the Chef's Ravioli off the appetizer menu and it came with THREE ravioli. How is that an appetizer portion?? Also the bus staff were incredibly rude...incessantly bumping into people to clear their dishes without asking if they were done, filling water glasses after each sip taken and then at one point not returning for 30+ minutes. The bill was extremely high for the quality of food and service.

Typical steakhouse menu: The meat was anywhere between $32-$50 depending on your cut of choice, everything was a la carte with side dishes in the $8-$15 range.  Good thing boss man was taking care of the bill...  My 8 oz. filet came out with a whole bulb of roasted garlic - OH YEAH.  Automatic star just for that tasty garnish.  My filet was more of a medium than a medium rare as I ordered, but I was too exhausted and hungry after a 10 hour day of standing and trying to sell to complain about it.  I got the sauted broccolini  as my side, and an order of the bearnaise sauce.  I thought $2 for 1 oz. of sauce was ridiculous - but whadduyagunnado? It's Vegas, baby. Vegas.

We came here for dinner after the Mystere show. I wasn't impressed with the food, honestly. I ordered seared ahi appetizer, and was brought a small plate with literally 4 bites of ahi, and a ridiculous amount of sauce. (I would loved to have some ahi with my sauce.) it was something like $20. I'm used to paying less for much more/better quality here in so cal. I then ordered a wedge salad. It was a decent size, lots of tomatoes, bacon, and bleu cheese crumbles, and about a gallon of bleu cheese salad dressing. It was absurd. At that point I was over ordering any real food, because if you can't make a dish as simple as a wedge salad, I'm not confident in your abilities to cook an over priced piece of meat better than I can. I regret not going across the street to Ruth's Chris.   Ok, so the water story. I appreciate that they kept me so hydrated. Its Vegas, so cocktails throughout the day is just what you do. I was seriously parched and immediately drank my glass of  tap  water. (Sorry, wasn't going to be that pretentious and order a pellegrino.) It's like the servers and busses were watching me, because the second I put my still almost full water glass down, they came back right away to refill it. And aggressively at that. They never once spilled, but the entire table was cracking up and surprised  that we weren't given a shower with each refill, which was literally after every sip. Anyway, I guess you had to be there.

The petite filet and baked potato was the perfect amount of food before going out. We both ordered our filet medium-rare.

We made reservations ahead of time and our hostess sat us with minimal wait. The waiting staff were great and made sure our food came out fast so we could make our show on time. Even though we ordered off a prix fixe menu, they made us feel like we were like any other customers.  We both ordered the Viognier-semillon, which tasted old for a white wine.. Almost to the point of tasting like vinegar.   I opted for the lobster corn chowder, which was phenomenal, while she went with the Cesar salad. The salad was a rather sad blend of whole romaine hearts and subpar dressings. I would have preferred to see a plate of chopped bright green romaine with real parmesan shavings in comparison to what we were served.  Our entrees were top notch. Her filet mignon was delightful and the accompanying mashed potatoes and asparagus were done right. My halibut risotto was very tender and the creamy garlic sauce was delectable. The two shrimp that came on the plate were only half shelled, so tended to be a bit messy as they were covered in sauce.  Our desserts were delicious. We ordered one of each, cappuccino creme br√ªl√©e and the chocolate crossing bread pudding. Both were equally enjoyable, but she preferred the creme br√ªl√©e. I ordered a coffee (which was not on our table d'h√¥te menu, +$4.00) and our waiter even offered to put it in a to-go cup so we could arrive on time for Mystere.   We caught a glimpse of the regular menu and were very pleased with our package deal as this could have easily been a $150+ meal. Do remember to tip appropriately even though you're on a prix fixe / complimentary meal ticket.

Shrimp in an added Shrimp Cocktail appetizer were big and meaty but not perfectly deveined.  Very good French Onion Soup arrived in a small cast iron crock with a nice chewy mix of Swiss and Gruyere Cheese and very tasty hot broth swiftly breaking down an easily yielding crouton.  As a solid alternative, Lobster Corn Chowder had a nice mix of vegetables to go with the bits of lobster and creamy soup.  Complimentary lengths of Baked Potato Bread with Bacon tasted somewhat like a Baked Potato with large bacon chips, and was somewhat addicting.  Before entrees arrived, I downed three knobby segments of this unusual bread product myself, alternately lubricating them with regular butter and Chive Butter.      For my main, I enjoyed a buttery, perfectly medium rare 8 oz. Filet which went well with a great drinkable, made-fresh-daily Bearnaise Sauce and real yummy Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes.  Grilled Asparagus on the plate was also nicely prepared.  For dessert I liked both Black Forest Bread Pudding with Bing Cherries and a sweet Berry Sauce, and glassy Cappuccino Creme Brulee which appropriately tasted more like Cappuccino than pure coffee.    Service was good on the whole, but there were a couple of service errors.  Our waiter forgot to keep the shrimps out of the Cocktail Sauce, and peppers out of the Lobster Corn Chowder as requested to please Diane's sensitive palate.  But these were but temporary setbacks.  I willingly licked the robust Cocktail Sauce off a shrimp before presenting it to Diane, and our server quickly returned with a replacement pepper-less bowl of Chowder for her.  The ambiance here is classy, with banquettes and linen-covered tables in front, and a few cushy booths in the back.  The dining room was full on a Friday night, and occasionally rather loud.

We asked what his reccommendations were for an appetizer, so we ordered the calamari and bruschetta. Oddly, the bruschetta toppings were separated, olives on one toasted bread, tomatoes on another, and mushrooms on another. It would've tasted a lot better if they were mixed all together. The bottom of the crusts were burned black. A little charcoal to help progress cancer..yum yum. The ceasar salad was a ceasar salad, nothing extraordinary. The calamari was soggy and salty.  Just when I was about to give up on this place and rate it a 2 star, our steaks came out. The NY Steak and Rib Eye came out perfectly seasoned and cooked. The steaks did not need the specials sauces and they were big enough to share one steak between two people. We were pretty full with the appetizers, one salad, and 2 steaks.

It was a loaded potato bread with melted cheese and tiny bits of bacon throughout the bread and a sour cream chive butter. I thought it was awesome. I'm a  baked potato with everything on it  kind of girl, so I lovveeddd the bread.  My choice was the 8 oz Filet Mignon. I never had it  butterflied  before, so I said yes once the waiter explained to me. Not like it could hurt it right? I choice a loaded baked potato as my side and also got a peppercorn sauce for my steak. I was surprised that the  garnish  was a whole roasted bulb of garlic. Scorreeee!!! Roasted garlic is the bomb! Why hasn't anyone else served roasted garlic with a steak?? Very nice touch!!! My filet was perfectly cooked and was sooo tender, the sauce was tasty, the baked potato was huge and the garlic added a wonderful extra touch and flavor!  Also had the Kobe Beef kabob which was served on this huge metal knife skewer thing which the staff removed for us. There was yummy onions and mushrooms and an accompanying gravy sauce that they poured over the beef and the mashed potatoes.

We couldn't pass up dessert so we ordered the Coco Puffs with Creme Brulee Ice Cream because I saw a nearby table order it and the presentation seemed cool. LOL! The coco puffs arrived still hot, but they were in the paper bag (just like the bread). Then they poured the coco powder in the bag and shook it all up to coat the puffs and then poured them on the side of the crme brulee ice cream. The coco puffs were like little cake/donut balls.

Good flavor, very chuncky with big dices of onions and green peppers. The best was the ravioli. Chef's choice was veggies (aka spinach) stuffed with a mascarpone tomato sauce. 3 to an order.

The Steak was just ok also, very bland I've had much better at other places.", "Date": "2009-12-29", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Tina", "ReviewID": "UYZVXM_7y5J8-4CAEjsKUQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I have nothing bad to say about this restaurant, so I'll give a brief summary of my opinions.  I consider myself a food snob (ok, food lover and pretty darn good chef as well with culinary training and experience), but when in Vegas, honestly - full service dining is expensive.  What you get for what you pay is a bit out of whack compared to home.  So here goes...  In summary, we were a party of 5, with a 9pm reservation on a Saturday night. GREAT:  Service - from all employees we encountered.  Timeliness was excellent - seated immediately, food came to us fast. The potato/bacon/cheese dinner rolls - OMG these are amazing, and I'm about to search the internet for the recipe!  Oh, and ours arrived in a linen lined bread basket, so I guess the paper-bag trend is over. GOOD:  Food overall.  Besides the dinner rolls, nothing was a stand out (as in  I must must must eat here again!), but nothing was horrible or unacceptable whatsoever.  The prices were typical for a steak house in an upper-end strip hotel.  I got what I expected here.  My steak was cooked to perfection - if it hadn't have been, then I would've felt it a waste of money! BAD:  Nothing!  Not a single member of our party had anything bad to say! Can't comment: On the wines or desserts.  Didn't have either.  In summary, we enjoyed our experience at this restaurant and the service made it worth the price.  Sure, there's better food out there, but nothing we had was low quality.  I'd eat there again, however Vegas has so much to offer, that next time I will try somewhere else.", "Date": "2009-02-11", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Sola", "ReviewID": "6ssZMSfKAAgt3FArTyhynQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Came here for my sister's birthday dinner.

I may be being a bit harsh because I expect a lot out of steak house dinners, but I am just telling it like it is!  For an appetizer, the boy and I both got the lobster and corn chowder. I will definitely give them this one and say that it was very good.  The pieces of lobster were delicious, and the consistency was perfect. The main courses is where it goes down hill. The salmon that I got was extremely bland and gooey. After a few bites I felt a little nauseated. The horseradish hollandaise sauce tasted like watery mayonnaise with absolutely no kick, the asparagus I had on the side was wilted, thin, and burnt. The boy had the 8oz filet mignon which had a weird tin-like flavor about it. I ordered a glass of reisling (the only one on their menu which was surprising) which was tasty, but the server brought it out in a metal container and literally just dumped it into my glass causing it to splash up a bit and create a lot of air bubbles. I don't know how you're supposed to treat wine, I am not much of a wine person, but I don't think dumping it is the right way to go! Now for the reason I am giving it 2 stars and not 1: The creme brule. It may be extremely tiny, but it was wonderful! So creamy and sweet, the sugar on top heated and solidified to perfection. Yay for creme brule! Overall, I would say I am very disappointed. The atmosphere was weird and uncomfortable, and the food was blah. If you want a wonderful steak house meal, definitely go to Craft at MGM! They treat you like kings and their food is breath taking!", "Date": "2008-12-29", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ksena", "ReviewID": "W1vLK_Xm6egxXzUpSaZ-eA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Exelent !!!!!

Located in the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino. The facility was nice and the service was decent - my glass of water never saw half full . I ordered the surf and turf  (lobster tail and filet mignon). Now I'm from Dallas so I've had my fair share of amazing steaks (Nick and Sams $35/oz Wagyu from the Kobe prefecture in Japan) and this my friend wasn't one of them. First off I asked for medium rare and it was definitely charred to a medium. Second...did they just completely miss the seasoning? Typically you don't need any but cmon...keep it simple with some salt and pepper at least. The lobster tail wasn't bad, however, I did drown it in lemon and butter so who knows really...hehe.  I will say the sides were pretty delicious, but can you really mess up mashed potatoes", "Date": "2016-05-04", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jamieleigh", "ReviewID": "poZVLMLgyEnc8oBTEBklDQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Very quiet place (aside from the guests at the bar) with great, attentive service.

This was my second time eating here in about 2 years and this last visit we had some mishap's.......SEE REVIEW BELOW. The Steak House is alright. Not one of my favorites, but good nonetheless. As far as the prices go, I think it ranks average in terms of other high end/fancy steak houses. I love Ruth's Chris Steak House and this place may be a bit more expensive, but not by much.   We Ordered:  Lobster & Corn Chowder - very fishy tasting, but my husband liked it  Caesar Salad - OK, nothing special  T-Bone Steak - Good  Fillet Mignon (8-oz) - Good, once cooked properly......SEE REVIEW BELOW  Added Oscar Style to the Filet (Crab Meat & Bearnaise Sauce) - sauce was good, but the crab meat was fishy and had a lot of pieces of shell in it  Garlic Whipped Potatoes - very garlicky and very good  Mac-n-Cheese - not much flavor and very gritty sauce   Experience:  First, we had 3-4 different people as waiter's & server's. Kind of confusing with that many different people for one table.   Second, the downside is NO Rib-Eye Steak! Well there is for $80, which is a 40-ounce......but me and my husband eat different steaks. How can an expensive steak house not have a rib eye steak for one?   Third, my filet was undercooked. I ordered it medium-well and it came a little over medium-rare. My husband's t-bone was cooked perfect.   Fourth (THE BIG PROBLEM), not one of our multiple waiter's came over to our table after our food was brought to us to see how everything was or if we needed anything. 10 minutes went by and still no one in sight! Odd! Finally our first server (who refills water and brings the bread & butter) came by and my husband asked to have our main waiter come to our table. 5 minutes go by and he totally ignores us. Finally my husband yelled across the room at the guy who sets the tables to come over. We told him my steak was not cooked medium-well. He apologized and took it to the kitchen. Not long after, our other 2 waiter's came out to apologize. My husband was about done eating before they had taken my steak back to recook it. It took an additional 15 minutes to bring my steak back out and they forgot the bearnaise sauce with it, but still had the crab meat on top.   Fifth, It took forever to get the bill, forever for them to pick-up the bill and forever for them to bring back the bil.  I think from start to end, we were at the restaurant for over 2 hours!!!!!  It was very disappointing to go to a nice and expensive steak house and have that type of service. Who wants to eat by themselves while their spouse has already eaten and is now watching you eat? I will not be back here again.

I took my boyfriend there for our one year anniversary. It was alright. I read some of the reviews so I was kind of skeptical, but it wasn't that bad. A little weird, though. They sat us at a table for 6, and the restaurant was almost empty. There was the lady walking around asking for pictures. My boyfriend said it felt like he was on a cruise. Oh, and I couldn't figure out who our server was! A lady offered us water. I asked her for some bread and a wine list after waiting 10 minutes. The bread itself has like pepperoni, or somethibg in it, which is kinda weird, and it only sucked for me because I don't eat pork, and I was really hungry. Then another guy came and asked about wine. We ordered a small (2-3 glasses a person) bottle of champagne. Then ANOTHER guy came an asked us about appetizers. ??? Anyway! We had the mozzarella sticks. They were pretty good. Light, and crispy. The sauce wasn't too heavy, which I liked.   Turns out the second guy was our  official  server. He introduced himself when he brought the champagne. My boyfriend ordered the T-bone steak. I had the chicken parmesan. The portions were big, which was great. The steak was not over flavored. The chicken parm was not heavy either. The asparagus and mashed potatoes were a little salty, though. The appetizer guy brought us our food. And the first lady kept our water full. The only thing our server did was bring the champagne. We had to ask him for the bill, because he never came to check on us. I don't know. It was alright over all. Not really worth $160 or two people, but since it was our anniversary, I paid it.", "Date": "2010-12-22", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
