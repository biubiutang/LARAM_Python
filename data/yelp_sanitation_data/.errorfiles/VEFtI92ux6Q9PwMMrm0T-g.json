Their eclairs are DELICIOUS. Great pastry that has structure, but still light. The filling is delicious. I love all the different flavors, too.   Macaron ($2.25): Avocado, Tarragon, Balsamic, Chocolate Salted Chip, Vanilla Raspberry, Chocolate Caramel, and Cilantro. The macarons are on point. Perfectly chewy with great fillings and the flavors are so much fun! I've really enjoyed the more unique flavors such as avocado, tarragon, balsamic, and cilantro. I didn't really care for the other flavors though.  Basque ($5): Classic and Apricot. This was my first experience with Gateau Basque or Basque Cake and I am obsessed. It seriously speaks to me. I love its slightly cake-y texture with a cross of a tart (especially with the almond flavor) and I looove the almost custard-like pastry cream. I was also fortunate to have the Classic Basque fresh out of the oven and it was heaven. They frequently mix the pastry cream with a fruit filling and although I'm not as much of a fan of that situation, the apricot was nice.  Croissant ($3.75): I've only had the Black Truffle Croissants (like 6 of them..) and that's all I'll ever need. Admittedly, I wish it had a little more truffle in it, but don't we all wish there was more truffle everywhere? I just take them home and add a little Black Truffle Salt before consumption. YUUUUUMM.  Canelé ($3.50): Another first for me and I'm already such a big fan of French pastries (and French everything, really). The inside is supposed to be sort of custard-y and the exterior has a caramelized crust. The French are brilliant! Haha, I love the crunchy, chewy exterior with the soft, moist interior. Really good stuff.  Gelato: I've tested a few flavors, but I've only ever ordered a scoop of the Chocolate & Mascarpone Gelato because it was just too amazing. So creamy and yummy. I love mascarpone.  Oh man, why does 346 have to be SO FAR from me?!? Sigh, it's probably a good thing for my waist and wallet. Lately, I've been trying to find any reason to go to 346 when I'm anywhere near the Henderson area. It doesn't work out often, but I'm so excited when I do get to go. Mostly for the surprise of flavors that'll be available, but I definitely have my favorites now. Basques and Caneles are a must for me now and definitely macarons. Ooh, and eclairs. French pastries FTW!  To add to the amazingness, the owners are delightful and so passionate about their patisserie. It's wonderful.

The chef is the owner and makes wonderful pastries and gelato! I've been here two out of the last three days ( they've only been open three days, lol!) and I've tried lots of gelato flavors. The pistachio and 72 percent chocolate are my favorite, but I'm a chocolate lover and so don't have much use for vanilla or cream flavors. I did try the Szechuan and the jalapeño grapefruit and the flavor was too intense for me! The other day I had a strawberry balsamic macaron and I honestly think it was the best I've ever had - and I've tried a lot of macaroons, all over Las Vegas, on and off the strip, and in NYC. Lots of people in Las Vegas make their macarons too sweet, this one had intense flavor, didn't overly rely too much on sugar and had a light and flaky cookie. Today I had a cinnamon roll fresh out of the oven and it was unbelievable! Next time I will be sampling the different flavored croissants, can't wait!

I wanted to go twice before I wrote a review.  First of all they are closed Wednesday, and every week all their flavors change out and are often inspired by the weather, holidays, seasonal ingredients etc.  They are so helpful and passionate about what they do.  When we first went in,  we got to try many samples, and they explained the thought process that went into the creation of these flavors.   They also offer vegan gelato, which I have never seen before. Their flavors are so fun and unique like rose scented raspberry, or black current tea.  They always have the Tahitian vanilla, and dark chocolate.  My boyfriend who doesn't like sweets often, loved the vanilla! You can custom order a container of a flavor you like if you can't live without it in your daily living. They also do half scoops for indecisive people like me, and their toppings are so inventive.  My boyfriend had a toasted chocolate marshmallow that they made in house and then they applied liquefied nitrogen as they cracked it into prices that then melt in your mouth. My favorite gelatto combo so far was their lemon which was nice and tart and refreshing, with the white chocolate strawberry, which had small slivers of white chocolate throughout without being overly sweet.  This is a big thing here, they let the flavors speak for themselves instead of giving you sugar bombs.    This brings me to the macaroons, the only ones I have found beside bellagio that I love.  A perfect ratio of filling and the disks that encased it were moist with a delicate yet crackable outer shell. I tried matcha,violet, rose, and Jasmine, all amazing.  Their croissants are wonderful flakey and buttery, and the one I had was infused with truffle   The eclairs have a wonderful pastry cream filling and mine was lavender flavored.  The outer casing was nice and airy without getting to dry, and also not soggy from the filling.  I also had a dessert with browned milk mousse, and another that had various fruits including passion fruit and star fruit.  These people are true artists in the culinary world, with an amazing and diverse pallet.

Arthur and  Amber have slowly gained a little  cult following  that grows each day with their vision of a modern day patisserie in Henderson.  A frozen dessert shop is what they like to consider themselves, partly because they serve frozen concoctions using liquid  nitrogen that's -346 degrees  (hence the name) but that is not all they do. They are a combination of a patisserie,  a gelateria, and a science lab all rolled into one!  Entering these doors,  the daily selection of cookies,  marshmallows, uncommon flavors of macarons like Avocado, Balsamic Vinegar, and Black Truffle, flavor infused croissants like Raspberry, Black Truffle, and Ghost Pepper, and the only place in town that does a pretty solid Gateaux Basque (loved the Fig-Balsamic, Apricot, and Classic with Vanilla pastry cream)fillings that change throughout the week are definitely worth a drive.  Their gelato case is also an assortment of ever changing unconventional  flavors as well where Chef  Arthur experiments with spices, teas, exotic fruits, high end chocolates, and even  churning speeds to turn out great flavor combinations like Chocolate-Ghost Chili, Red Eye, Soursop and Pink Guava Sorbet, and my favorite so far, Chocolate Mascarpone Gelato. Go on to 346's website and submit a flavor that  you would like to see, and if it ever  makes it in to the case, you get  a pint! Chris V.'s Jasmine Milk Tea was a success.  Do not pass up the opportunity to try any of their petit gateaux and verrines selections as well.  That Honey Mousse and Wine Gelee with  Honeycomb and The Blueberry Verrines were definite winners.   If you're the typical whiner who complains about driving ALL the way to Henderson? STAY HOME...If you're the typical penny pincher who can't comprehend the price point to the quality of ingredients used? Maybe Albertsons, Vons, or Mickey D's desserts will suit you better.

I agree with other reviews that this is more of gelato and sorbets than a real  patisserie . The baked goods are very limited to a small selection of macarons, tarts and a couple croissants. I also agree it is a little overpriced which will keep me from coming back often (which will be good for my waist!).  Chocolate tart was $7, croissants $4.25 and our ice cream sandwich and frozen macaron came to just under $12. The ice cream sandwich was 2 chocolate chip cookies with Madagascar vanilla gelato. The gelato was full of vanilla beans which were very visible. The frozen raspberry macaron was a frozen vanilla center with raspberry jam between two raspberry macarons. We thought they were both very good.   346 also has complimentary water which is flavored differently each day. Today's was fresh berries. I love that everything is homemade and baked daily but this will only be a once in a while treat for us.", "Date": "2015-03-08", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "David", "ReviewID": "lZdYP_-_dTl95CEBeA38CQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": " All life is an experiment. The more experiments you make the better.  -- Ralph Waldo Emerson  346 is all about experimentation! They continually craft fine products due to this exploratory nature. The down side is that they have a small variety of pastries and gelatos that are constantly changing so your favorites might not always be in. The upside is that there are some pretty great options that find their way out of the kitchen! Where else will you try truffle croissants one day and ghost chili croissants the next? 4 star pastries and 5 star gelato!...4 strong stars in general!  On any given day there will be 10 - 12 different gelato/ice cream/sorbet flavors to choose from. If you want a specific gelato or sorbet special orders from their ever-growing catalogue of flavors can be made with a 3 pint minimum...or custom designed flavors can be done with a 3 quart minimum. Many of their flavors can also be duplicated into macaroons. Since their gelato case is rather small this are pretty cool options. Some of my favorite flavors are listed below, but check out their website for a full list of catalogue flavors: Madagascar Vanilla Bean Valrhona Guajana 70%  Szechuan Chocolate  Roasted White Chocolate  Espresso Caramel Toasted Almond Passion Fruit and Vanilla Crème Brulee Pecan Streusel Mascarpone and Chocolate Vanilla Honey  Lychee   Sorbet: Lemon and Thyme Passion Fruit Yuzu White and Green Tea Fusion Honey Cardamom Grapefruit-Jalapeno   All of the gelato flavors are not technically gelatos. 346 doesn't really adhere to conventional standards for gelato vs. ice cream. They see it as a spectrum and create recipes with texture in mind to get the best outcome possible. Consistently exceptional! Their pastries aren't quite as strong as their frozen creations in my opinion. They are still quite good, but not as outstanding as the frozen case. The selection is thankfully growing every time we come back, but is still on the small side. Additionally, they don't seem to approach the pastries with the same creative abandonment that they do with their frozen treats. I recently very excited to try a ghost pepper croissant...the flavor was great, but the use of ghost pepper was peculiar...it wasn't very hot at all as ghost pepper items go. You can regularly find cookies, tarts, macaroons and basque cakes (LOVED the pastry cream-filled), but come early for their lovely croissants...in fact come early or call to reserve any specific item you want because the supply is usually on the short side of demand...a good issue for this small, literal, mom & pop place to have!  Additionally they offer several novelty toppings like torched house-made marshmallows and liquid nitrogen frozen mousse. These are cool to experience, and the marshmallows seem to be a hit with marshmallow fans, but I can pass on the frozen mousse.   Others have said it's a little pricey here. Everything is relative. It may be a little on the high side for Vegas, but it certainly isn't over-priced...and it is a little cheaper than what we face in larger cities with great food scenes.", "Date": "2015-04-15", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "_G_y6-1csEIC7CijYd5ybw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "real yummy gelato service is great  Amber is a great gal try the chocolate croissants", "Date": "2015-03-04", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Patty", "ReviewID": "vi6Jy2KU706Kxfu0L5SP5Q", "Overall": "5", "Content": "We walked in and I have to say, the overall feel of the place was kinda sterile.

While foie might be an acquired taste, it was nice, rich, savory and still subtle enough for even non-foie lovers to enjoy.    The owner, Amber, was really cool and stated they went through a long process (and lots of Foie) to figure out a nice recipe from scratch.   Thank you for this.  I enjoyed a half scoop of this mixed with a half scoop of Black Sesame.  My wife and kid shared a Cookies and Milk +  Chocolate and Marscapone scoop.   The cool topping they added to their scoop was a toasted marshmallow, frozen with liquid nitrogen, then shattered into crumbles on top.  Amber literally blow torched a marshmallow, threw it in a bowl, poured liquid nitrogen over it and shattered it all with the cold smoke rising.  It was awesome to see.  My wife also tried their macaroons and said they were very good.    Other things they are trying are flavor-infused croissants.  Right now, they are doing it only on the weekends, but they plan to do it more regularly starting in may.

I've now been able to stop in here twice and have been pleasantly surprised each time.  Located on Stephanie just north of Paseo Verde, 346 Patisserie is Vegas', err Henderson's newest gelato/dessert shop. This bright little shop is doing things a bit different than just about everyone else in town though. Not only do they offer a constantly rotating gelato selection, but they also rotate a pretty large variety of other treat items too. From flavored marshmallows and macarons, to cookies, croissants, tarts and even rarely seen basque cakes. What 346 does though is perfectly summed up by Shirley B. and her example of combining art and science into their treats. On that note alone, it's worth stopping by just to see what they're all about.  On our first visit, we walked in only about 15 minutes from closing. Even so, Amber was more than willing to talk to us and explain their concepts, all while letting us sample anything we wanted. The level of service she offers definitely matches the product. You can tell she is extremely passionate about what her and husband do. It's also very clear that they are knowledgable about their products and have spent a lot of time developing them. With that being said, it's also pretty neat to hear them talk about experimenting with things and even bringing them out for customers. As an example, she let us know about some new truffle infused croissants they are working on and will be offering up in the next week or so. It's cool to hear that they are willing to do things that really aren't done very often, and they aren't afraid to take feedback that could easily go either way.   Now that we have been here on a couple occasions, we've got to try a few different things. We've mainly come for gelato, but that doesn't mean their other dessert items aren't excellent either. So far every gelato flavor we've tried has been extremely on point and didn't disappoint in the slightest. A great tip first posted by Lore D. is that they'll even do half scoops for you at no additional charge. Not only does this give you an opportunity to get more flavors without having too much, but you can do so without spending extra money. The gelato itself has a very good texture that's both creamy and smooth making for a near perfect gelato mouthfeel. Stand outs for me have been Toasted Almond, Ghost Pepper and Jasmine Milk Tea. Each of these brought an exact flavor that you expected with each and every bite.   The toppings for the gelato is another area where 346 shines for me. Using the art and science example is perfect when you talk about their topping choices. Using liquid nitrogen, Amber takes ordinary items and turns them into something special. A toasted marshmallow turns into a delicate combination of crunchy and gooey little bites with just a hint of smokiness. Ordinary honey turns into a frozen strand that almost resembles pieces of glass, yet as it warms up just melts in your mouth. And chocolate mousse transforms into crunchy bits of chocolate flavor bursts. So far, not a single one of the toppings has let me down. Not to mention, it's pretty fun to watch them being made.  But as I said, 346 isn't just about gelato. Their treat selection is just as good. We've only tried a couple different things, but stand outs for me so far were the Salted Caramel Tart and macarons. I had both a Raspberry macaron and a Black & White Truffle macaron that were both excellent. Their ability to present the flavor without being overpowering speaks for itself. The macarons themselves are executed well and some of the better ones you can get in town if you ask me.  Price-wise they are a little bit on the high side.

Amber and Arthur, thank you for giving us 346 Patisserie. For a long time (admittedly, most of this time being while Desyree was in transition), it was my favorite place for gelato (and ice cream and sorbet) not just in Henderson, but in the entire Las Vegas valley. You brought my flight of fancy to life as Chris's Jasmine tea with milk (as well as several other customers with their own customer-inspired flavors), and it was as heavenly as I could have imagined. You produced other outstanding flavors, some of my favorites being the natural hazelnut, the surprising Earl Grey sorbet, the cinnamon pecan streusel that hit all the right notes, the unique Caramelia (a special caramel chocolate), the savory yet delightful cacio e pepe, and your recent innovation that brought the chocolate flavor back to chocolate gelato. Some of those flavors of chocolate gelato 2.0 remain my favorite chocolate frozen anything to this day.  This is mostly going to be a list-as-a-paragraph, but the other flavors of frozen desserts that I especially enjoyed included banana stracciatella, balsamic, lychee, Belgian ale, chai tea latte, black currant tea, ginger peach tea w/ raspberry (R.I.P. the tea gelato shop), papaya (as ice cream and as sorbet), mango (matching the vastly more expensive product of Amorino), and foie gras w/ cherry and caramel. What other shop has made even half of those flavors? I'm sure I wouldn't be exaggerating to say that I was able to try over 100 different flavors from your kitchen. Let's be honest: not everything hit all the time, whether the texture or flavor was lacking, but the successes were big successes. And because you invited people to sample flavors, they could generally find something that worked. What an awesome experimental gelato/ice cream/sorbet shop you guys were.  Remember how I never tried any baked goods for months? I got around to tasting your macarons, and their crunchy shells were consistent and tasty, with a good ratio of filling as well. I wouldn't say that most of them stood out in terms of flavor, but they won that Las Vegas Weekly award, which you should be proud of. And I'm going to miss the black and white truffle savory macarons. Oh my goodness, they really brought my understanding of macarons and truffles to a new level.  I can get my fix of passion fruit elsewhere, but I'll also miss your passion fruit marshmallow. I remember taking small bites over the course of days out of that huge fluffy cube and getting that hit of passion fruit each time. Remarkable.  The croissants - well, let's be honest here. The unflavored ones weren't so special. However, the truffle-infused croissant was an interesting recipe that I know a lot of people loved, and the ghost pepper croissant was my favorite from my few croissant orders. It managed to hit on that spicy flavor without being too overwhelming. Given that it's ghost pepper, you must have using it very sparingly, but my taste buds actually thank you for that. I'm going to say that the best layered butter baked good that you made was the kouign amann, which my foodie friend and I both favorably compared to the famous DKA. It was a sweet treat that we won't soon forget.  I also got around to the Basque cake. It was as great as everyone said it was, and I'll remain convinced that it's the best Basque cake ever... if I never get around to trying it elsewhere. I recall eating the Basque cake that was filled a mixture of the traditional pastry cream as well as fresh raspberry, and it was also a delight to enjoy the buttery, soft dough with a bit of a crispy exterior.  Your signature chocolate chip cookie also escaped my palate until it was almost too late, but about a month ago, my friend from out of town tried it and shared half with me. It was one of the best chocolate chip cookies that I've ever had, and the chocolate and dough impressed me equally. I would be so happy if I could eat something like this cookie again some day.  My last wonderful memory will be the wonderful British scone that I believe you unveiled in your final month. I had the dark chocolate and pecan scone, where plenty of both of those ingredients filled a dough that was soft on the inside, crunchy on the very outside, and was good from start to finish.  While I didn't manage to try any of your cold case pastries aside from the eclairs (the matcha was good), I've heard that they'll find a good home elsewhere soon. Hopefully, the same holds for your other delights.  Thank you for all the delicious memories, Arthur and Amber. While I was heartbroken not to be able to say goodbye on your last day, I can take solace in what I was able to experience on all of the other days. Your star burned bright, and it burned out quickly. May we see it shine again someday.", "Date": "2015-09-23", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Fuchsia", "ReviewID": "PU10m03cg34TOOo5I_p0Aw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I cannot stop taking about this place!

Both were very good but the pistachio was my favorite.  The petit chocolate chips in the pistachio were just perfect and not overdone in number.  The 5 spice gave the banana a different twist to the banana flavor.  The shop had a water dispenser at the rear of the store with cold water with lime and some rose petals to add flavor to the water.  It was cool and a nice palate cleanser after the gelato.    Before heading out, I got a gâteau Basque and two black and white truffle macarons.  The macarons, listed as savory on the card by them, had a flavor that was off putting to me.  The Basque was excellent.  They had three flavors available and I got the fig.  While the Basque I've had before were filled more and had less cake than this one, I really enjoyed the Basque and I could see myself stopping off to get another one.

And three macarons. And some freeze dried marshmallow topping. Nom.  In all seriousness, the chocolate chip cookie was fantastic. It had a nice nutty flavor that you get from baked buttery goodness and the chocolate was in abundance.  The macarons were equally delicious while, once again, not being overly sweet. I was excited to try the truffle macaron, which while tasty, didn't exactly make me think truffle - perhaps it's because the sweetness of being a cookie doesn't exactly match truffle. The passion fruit was great though.  It was a lot of fun to see them blowtorch a marshmallow then pour liquid nitrogen  right on top of it, but the result wasn't as great as I expected.

Plus, if you submit a flavor online and they pick it for their flavor of the month you get a free pint. 346 has so many unique flavors and they let you sample them too. They also have homemade cookies and macaroons. You can even make an ice cream sandwich or macaroon sandwich with the gelato of your choice! Talk about yummy! On this visit they had Sriracha Gelato, Earl Gray Tea Gelato and my favorite Madagascar Vanilla Bean Gelato. Not only do they have toppings, but they have toppings that they freeze in liquid nitrogen. It's so cool seeing it in person.   The taste is great! Super creamy. The cookies were a little hard, but I think it was because they'd been in the freezer prior. It still was really yummy. I also tried an apricot and rosemary macaroon.

I went with a safe flavor of birthday cake.  I noticed the additional toppings and one caught my eye - caramel powder.  One scoop is usually more than enough.  It was not the case here.  It seemed to be a very very small scoop.  Yes the gelato was very very creamy but I would have left off the caramel powder. The powder wasn't a powder at all.

Service was extremely friendly, gave us lots of info and background on the products, and was very generous with the samples.  HOWEVER, the main drawback here is the price. Macarons are on the small side (as they should be), but are $2.50 each. Even the chocolate chip cookies were $2.50. So for 3 cookies, a marshmallow and a tiny ball of gelato.....$16.

Found in a nondescript strip mall, but already with several 'regulars' that arrived as I chatted with Front of House Manager Amber Pappageorge as Chef Haynes occasionally emerged from the back to further stock the already impressive shelves, 346 Patisserie is the sort of place where modern meets tradition and while many have cited the use of liquid nitrogen and culinary sorcery in several of the menus novelties the experience I mapped instead focused on items more classic, the total $23.58 for eight a veritable steal compared to similar storefronts found nationwide.  Clearly a Francophile, the majority of pastries falling under the 'laborious' category while most other local bakeries opt for quickbreads and cupcakes, no visit to 346 should go without first sampling some of the store's handmade gelatos and with each flavor crafted from start to finish without a premade starter or base the flavor profiles are a study in subtle purity, even the Vanilla extremely impressive while my choices of faintly sweet yet buttery 'croissant' and intense dark chocolate were delicious on their own but all the better when smashed between two cookies, the chocolate chip in particular amongst the very best in town.  Moving next to a trio of macarons, it was perhaps an effect of arriving so early that found both the Hazelnut and Black and White Truffle still a bit cool and, thus, somewhat gummy but again with very natural flavorings replacing the standard of sweetness it was quite a surprise that the holiday themed Cadbury proved a spot-on riff of the eponymous chocolate egg, every aspect right down to the cream filling accounted for within a shattering cookie that makes me want to return soon in order to see if, in fact, the off-textured others were mere anomalies.  Onward to choux, suffice it to say that the small-ish éclairs at 346 meet the standards set by many French Patisserie and although the pastry cream inside the Vanilla iteration was rich and sumptuous the almost-savory center of the pistachio was even more refined, the chocolate not quite ready during this visit but yet another reason to return in short order.  Rounding out the morning with Haynes two best offerings, a high bit of praise considering the rest, fans of the croissant would be well served to drive down to South Stephanie Street both soon and repeatedly given the wide variety of specials offered throughout the week, and opting for Raspberry only to find the flavor literally fused to the lamination process with a crisp shell shattering to light notes of fruit amidst buttery caverns I can hardly wait until the full line rolls out with the soon-to-be-launched coffee program...though for my $5 I think that java would be even better off paired to the city's only Gateaux Basque, a dense butter cake with a light layer of housemade jam at its base that substantially ups the ante on any American 'coffee cake.'  Still an imperfect vision given the limited beverage selection and a few macarons that simply weren't up to snuff it can only be said that what 346 is trying to do down in Henderson is far more inspired than almost any other spot in Sin City.

I appreciate the creativity of the house-made flavors, and their flavor suggestions policy- if yours is picked, you get a free pint!

Service from Amber was friendly and informative, I wish I were able to be in the area more often to pop in and try featured flavors!", "Date": "2015-06-05", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "S", "ReviewID": "cC35B-X9g-fFwr8gHE_zmQ", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Came here the for the first time and tried their small french macaroon. A very nice couple owns this bakery.   We ordered the avocado macaroon and one other different flavor. Even though we ordered a different flavor, it tasted exactly the same as the avocado macaroon. So, that's why I wasn't able to remember the 2nd macaroon I purchased. The macaroon was good, but I didn't think it's memorable or that tasty. Maybe, is the flavor I purchased?!   We also ordered one of their ice creams which is homemade, but I thought it was too sweet.  Overall, I thought they had few selections on bake goods. Nothing enticing or interesting that I wanted to try. Not sure if I will come back. Maybe, if other bakeries were closed, I would consider coming to this place.", "Date": "2015-04-20", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Kim", "ReviewID": "p9fqhsJUqiykbs3ARILFBg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I was in Paris a month ago and at all the macarons I could get my hands on... The ones here are... Better???? Maybe not, but while I'm stuck in the U.S. for the foreseeable future, these are a perfect substitution!!! I walked in on Friday nite around 5 and they were super friendly and gave me the low down on when their new flavors roll out (they have a thurs-thurs schedule) I had their peach amaretto flavor and chocolate caramel macaron and they were the perfect texture and delicious middle. Can't wait to go back to this place. Next time I will have to try their assortment of pastries that looked very enticing.

I've been in twice and have had the pleasure of chatting with Amber both times. You can tell that she is incredibly passionate about her business and with good reason!  I have had a few different things from here and have not once been disappointed.  My all time favorite was the vanilla eclair, with the chocolate eclair coming in close second. They are those kinds of desserts that you take a bite and all that comes out is a groan of pure joy.  They have also have gelato, which they actually do make from scratch. Almost every place I have been to uses a base for their gelato, but NOT 346! You can tell. It's out of the this world and they are happy to let you sample their flavors, which is awesome!  Croissant wise...I am torn between the plain and chocolate croissant. They are equally delicious in their own ways and I would suggest getting both to try for yourself. I have been to almost every bakery in the valley and as I said before, 346 has the best croissants. The. Best.

Tasted ok, but not worth the price.  Please adjust your prices so you can stay opened longer than most of the businesses in that shopping center", "Date": "2015-07-24", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
