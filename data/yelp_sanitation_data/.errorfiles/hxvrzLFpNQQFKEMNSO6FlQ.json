We came here to see Sworn Enemy and Wretched, but we were interested in seeing some of the other bands that were in the line up too. When you walk in you will immediately notice how open this place is, there is plenty of space for a ton of concert goers. My guestimate is roughly a few hundred.  Your eyes are drawn to the stage, which is right in front of you as you walk through the doors.  Also, there is seating on each side of the venue, from booths to tables if need to have a seat.   The bar area is large, but disappointing because they have a low selection of rum. If you are a rum drinking pirate like me this is a problem, all they had was Sailor Jerry, Bacardi Original, and something else I can't remember the name of.... To some, that may seem like a decent selection, but it was disappointing for me personally. I settled on the Sailor Jerry, which isn't the worst thing in the world. Now I must warn you if you get a double expect to pay $19.00- that's right Nineteen Dollars!!! I coughed up the money but had to pinch myself to make sure I wasn't back in NYC because that is what I pay in a Manhattan night club! I have not paid that much for a drink since moving here, so I was stunned.   My advice is If you don't want to pay that much get a single instead of a double, otherwise you're going to have a pricey night just for a few drinks. A single is only 10.50 which isn't too bad- I could live with that.------------- End  of rant! Lolz.

Its unlike any other hip hop show Ive been to. You'll see old and young all having fun and its always a mixed crowd of people. My only complaint's about the place is it is a little hard to find at 1st & I'm not a huge fan of the food. Ive also seen a couple reggae shows and rock shows there on the weekend and the place gets pretty packed. Punk rock bowling was crazy last year! Couldn't even walk around in the place & its pretty big.  I go there every Tuesday for that hip hop night because its usually always free and I always have a good time.

It's not the easiest venue to find the entrance to, but at least it's on Fremont Street with plenty of parking close by and it's not that much of a walk to get into.   That being said the only positive things it has going for it is the quality of the band lineup and the Fremont Street physical location.   Sound System: The venue has a sound system that to be blunt sucks. I've seen high school kids cobble together pieces of crap equipment that sounded better than what this venue has. Security: Hey, at least the big burly guys wearing the shirts that said security looked impressive, but their ability to do anything security related like stop fights or actually follow the door policies is questionable at best.  Drink Prices: Prepare to pay Strip prices for drinks that would be more appropriate on the Boulder Highway strip. Even getting a beer was a hassle.   In short I go to LVCS to support the bands or the wrestling shows and I spend my money on merch, not drinks when I come here. As a venue it serves a need, but considering their location this place has a lot of potential that is just wasted.   It does offer a nice view of people lining up to ride Slotzilla so if the show sucks you can always people watch.

The shows tend to be long as they will have multiple bands from the same tour and then add a few locals into the mix, with a show starting at 8 PM expect a 1:30 or 2:00 AM exit.

The first night drinks had to be purchased at the venue's bar: at $8 a beer I only had one and didn't stick around for long.  The second night was much more fun: several kegs (paid for by registration fees) were open to attendees.  There's a lot of space in here, and not a lot of seating.  Great for dancing or watching a band, I guess, except that the acoustics were crap.  Also, this isn't the easiest place to find-- it's located on the second level above Fremont Street across from Heart Attack Grill, but seems to lack any kind of obvious signage indicating what it is or how to go about getting inside (hint: look for the escalator).

The ticket prices seem very reasonable and once you find the location it's actually pretty convenient. The venue is on the smaller side which I enjoy. My main issues are as follow:  I'll never understand bathroom attendants at punk rock/metal shows. I feel like this is a  classy  service that mohawked, tattooed people slurping down PBRs all night aren't really going to miss if it's not there. It's obnoxious. I realize everyone's gotta eat, but there's gotta be something else they could hire this guy to do - maybe be a bar back or something. I don't know. I just know that one more unnecessary body in an already small bathroom pumping soap into my hand followed by a paper towel isn't necessary.  My biggest complaint was the set times. There were seven bands in total at the show I attended. Looking at the line up of other great bands LVCS is soon to host, I see this is pretty typical. I was actually going to go to another show tonight but after my experience last night, I decided against it. The local bands are allowed 25 minute sets. This is in addition to their set up and tear down time. So each band is more or less using 40 minutes of time (give or take) for their performance. Some people like this as they feel they're getting a lot of bang for their buck. But some of us also have normal 9 to 5 jobs. The band I went to see (The Misfits) didn't BEGIN their set until around 12:45 AM. The show started at 8:00 PM. Almost 5 hours before the headliner even took the stage. So I've basically decided that I won't be going to any shows at LVCS unless there are fewer opening bands, shorter set times for openers, the shows are on the weekend or I REALLY want to see the band and am willing to take the next day off. Getting home at 2:00 AM to wake up about four hours later was not super thrilling.  So good bands, good set up, annoying bathroom attendants and poor efficiency.

I'll lay it all out there and let you sort it out.  My wife and I ended up here without intentionally setting out to do so.  We were out with another couple for dinner and they suggested we pop in because there was a band playing and they were supposed to be good.    When we arrived and got settled in, I was impressed, it's big and spacious, that appeals to me, I very much dislike being shoulder to shoulder anywhere I go.  The bar was easy to access from every location in the bar / band stage area.  Here's where the mixed feelings come in.  Every time we ordered a drink either from the bartender or a cocktail waitress, it almost felt like I was doing them a favor.  Now don't get me wrong, the service was NOT bad, it just wasn't friendly.  IN fact, if i was so rate the service alone, I would give it a 4.5 stars.  Then the band began playing, and where another mixed feeling for this review pokes its head.  The music was RIDICULOUSLY loud and sounded like it was bouncing off all the walls and settling down in a mish mash of sounds squarely in my ears.  Again, i'm not saying the band was not good, all i'm saying about the music, was it was very annoying loud and not received clear and crisp to me.  So in closing.... this one was a hard one to write because i can't say that they did anything wrong at all, I can definitely say there is room for improvement if customer comfort is the goal.

Whiskey Rodeo performed for three nights headlining a show at the LVCS.  The stage and venue were perfect for Whiskey Rodeo.  Whiskey Six also played, and they jammed out too.  The bartenders were friendly, attentive, and fast.    Walking into this dark low light scene, you see low tables with stripper poles lining the side of the saloon with huge windows that has the amazing view of Fremont Street. On the other side there are booths and in the middle are bar tables with the sound stage and beer pong tables.  Fun!  Being a yelper and needing something to eat, I had to try some of their food.  I got their sliders and they were very good, made to order (medium), and filled up my tummy.  Good food for drinking all night!  Their restrooms were really clean and so was the rest of the joint.  Now, this place is kinda tucked away upstairs just above Hennessey's and Mickey Finnz on Fremont.  You take the escalator up and there are two clubs upstairs.  This one and another one that is Hip Hop.  The outdoor seating (smoking) area for both clubs is really nice with the view of Fremont.  They also do hookahs!

It seems smaller than the more well-known House of Blues out there in terms of 'small venues', although a bit bigger than the Railhead at Boulder Station.  The way the club is set up is kind of strange. There are two bars: one outside the actual stage area and one inside. Then in front of that is the pit and stage of course.  Surprisingly, there's enough room to move around for moshing and crowd surfing. The security here don't seem to care if you start moshing, but if it gets too rowdy then they might stop you. If you're a repeat offender, they may kick you out.  The acoustics of this place sound very muddled, and I had a hard time deciphering what the band was singing. The instruments also seemed to blend together in a bad way. These are the only downsides to this joint.  A lot of punk rock bands play here, and the week before the Misfits' tour was The Casualties along with Negative Approach and several other bands. LVCS seems to be the 'punk house' for the scene. Hey, that's cool--brings a little more 'arts and culture' to the downtown area, which is something that's badly needed besides First Friday.  This place should actually be renamed the 'Las Vegas Punk Saloon' since more punk bands play here than country ones. That, go pyschobilly/rockabilly if they wanna stay a little bit Country.  I still think that bands should book somewhere else--the sound is just terrible, plus it's sort of hard to see the bands at times since the stage isn't raised.  Otherwise, not bad for cheap tickets. You'll never find tickets here that cost more than $40. They're all reasonably priced, especially for the amount of bands you're seeing.  P.S. the highlight of the Misfits concert was seeing Jerry Only get off the stage and French-kiss this punk rock chick that was directly in front of him. Mind you, Jerry's in his 50s now, and the chick he kissed seemed to be in her early-to-mid 20s or so. Just damn, man. Then again, I would still hit that no matter what age--Jerry is still hot to me.", "Date": "2013-11-13", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Sandra", "ReviewID": "RXq-y-2H4a1wvEbq39LGiQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "the Downtown Las Vegas live music destination!!

Given that there are no previous ratings, I think this is a pretty safe statement.   I arrived here under curious circumstances. My husband and I were scouting upright bass players for his band, and what better place to find an upright bass player than at a rockabilly show? This brings me to the first unique feature of the Saloon: unexpected musical line-ups. Don't let the name fool you! The stage here hosts a wide variety of music, not just the beer sippin', tractor drivin' variety. The night we visited the Stellar Corpses were the headliners. Stellar or otherwise corpses aren't really my thing, but props for the diversity of live music. Just noticed a burlesque group is performing tonight.   The second unique feature found here are the accessories: namely a mechanical bull and copious stripper poles. Now, I have never ridden either, but based on my limited surmisal, these things feel more punk than redneck. Perhaps, it was because I witnessed a handful of tatted rockabillies get thrown off the bull that night. Note: The website indicates that you get free bull rides with any purchase, but that might just be during happy hour. Happy hour is from 5pm-9pm every day with $3 drafts and half-priced apps. Sounds appealing.   The joint is spacious and clean, i.e. not smelly. The bartenders were friendly. All in all an unexpected little find. I am only giving three stars because I have not sampled the fare or gone on a busier night for the full experience.", "Date": "2010-07-17", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Mary Ann", "ReviewID": "-_qcuvDLcAdUboT2zvyqEg", "Overall": "2", "Content": "This place was not the easiest to find, maybe it's because I just moved here. the place was so smoky that all of my friends that are smokers opted to go outside, said their eyes were burning from all the smoke.

LVCS is located on Fremont Street on the second floor above Hennessey's. There's a small banner advertising the Saloon but if you didn't know what you were looking for you'd probably miss it. LVCS is a great music venue that caters to niche markets in music. The venue seems to host a lot of metal, punk, and hip-hop artists. I just recently went to see Nile at LVCS.   The stage at LVCS is small but allows for a more intimate experience with bands. The drinks are expensive,  but are on par with the prices you'd pay at the House of Blues at Mandalay Bay or the Pearl at the Palms. There was a promoter who was passing out 2 for 1 drink passes that we were able to use at the bar inside the venue. Since my husband and I are accustomed to paying $10+ for a beer at concerts, we were pretty stoked we could catch a break for once. The bartender was awesome! She was slammed but we never had to wait longer than a minute to get our beers.  LVCS has a great view of Fremont from the concert area and the outdoor smoking section, so there are plenty of opportunities for people watching. The bathrooms were clean but I almost slid off the toilet because the seat was unhinged- but no worries because this is a freaking metal venue!   Security lets people get pretty rowdy in the mosh pits, which is cool. Ticket prices are extremely reasonable and much cheaper than the venues in casinos.  Again,  love this place!", "Date": "2014-05-10", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Matt", "ReviewID": "zJNd5Dl110eA0hUYZTflYw", "Overall": "1", "Content": "The worst concert venue that Las Vegas has ever seen.  The sound  system  (if you could call it that) is garbage. It would honestly be better if the bands just played directly from their amps instead of playing through the terrible PA system. Security is a joke, four fights broke out (that I saw) and they only noticed one. It took a full song - almost 5 minutes - for them to even try and break up the fight, and neither of the assailants were kicked out. The bartenders might actually be mentally handicapped. They put vermouth in my girlfriend's Washington Apple. That's like adding sugar to candy.  This place is obviously geared towards tourists. I went here to see a band I like, and I would have had a better time drinking at my house playing their music through my phone speakers -- and it would've sounded better too.", "Date": "2015-05-25", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Girl", "ReviewID": "pxRWovxomSYQMgArMLEMGw", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Meh... This place has sooo much potential, but it seems no fucks are given. They have shows every once and a while. But if the place is not packed it seems very empty cause of how big it is. They had a cool mechanical bull in there,not sure if it still is. Its located in a prime spot on Fremont. This place could be doing some major performances, but I have yet to see this happen. Every once and a while it gets full from a big event here and there. But I think that place has waaaaay more potential and its just not being utilized.", "Date": "2014-01-04", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
