The asian cashew chicken salad is surprisingly delicious and crave worthy for a fast food salad, and is less than 400 calories! Oh, and they have that cool coca cola fountain with a million drink options.

I am unsure of the manager's name (blond hair) but he is always smiling, always professional and courteous and it trickles down to the staff. We have one or two Wendy's closer to our home or on our way home from work but we go out of our way to go to this location. They have the awesome Coca Cola machine that offers caffeine free Diet Coke...a BIG selling point for me, the restaurant is always clean inside and out...It is so nice to see such pride with the management and employees.

I've never had a Wendy's so close to me before and I'm loving it!  They always get my order right and my food is always fresh!  I just wish they weren't so stingy when it comes to sauces, sometimes they don't even ask you if you want sauces or will only give you 1 of each knowing you ordered a few combos :/ Just make sure you ask for extra sauce and ketchup too!

Went through the drive thru in which it took 10 minutes to get my food and when I got home the whole order was wrong.  I asked for a hamburger and they gave me a cheeseburger and the fries were not fresh.  Very disappointed.  So much for convenience.

I have never gone through the drive thru, always inside, but the dining area has been consistently clean and neat. The staff here are friendly and do a good job of getting the food out quickly and accurately. The quality of the food has always been very good: hot, juicy burgers and crispy fries. Even the salads, which have been hit and miss at other locations, are good here. No bruised, wilted lettuce to speak of.

We like the  summer berry salad  that we actually just had it at a different location a few days ago.  However, they didn't serve us with the  summer berry salad  with spring mix, strawberries & blackberries but gave us iceberg salad instead.  Even the picture on the ad also show spring mix vs iceberg lettuce.  That'y not cool! They shouldn't substitute the type of the lettuce as they do make a huge difference! Perhaps iceberg is way cheaper than spring mix?!", "Date": "2016-07-10", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Carl", "ReviewID": "q11vE4cLEAOzjy5t9RL79Q", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Great food but it is called fast food for a reason.

I was in the mood for some of their chili.  I am not ashamed to say that I always enjoy Wendy's chili! Pretty darn good.  Since it was just me, I went through the drive through to take lunch home.  The lady taking my order could have picked up a personality on the way to work today...  but I'm guessing maybe it's just been a long day for her. Otherwise the drive through went pretty smooth and quick.  I saw they had new flatbread sandwiches.  Guess I might as well try one right?!  I chose the Smokey Honey Mustard Grilled Chicken option... of course with my chili on the side.  On their sign in the drive through, it states the sandwich is only 370 calories and 22 g of protein!  Sure!  I'll give it a whirl!  It was a smaller chicken sandwich but that's probably why only 370 calories.  But it did have a great flavor with the smokey honey mustard sauce.  The flatbread was great also with grains baked in which gave it a great flavor.  Like I stated earlier, I always enjoy their chili.  It's always hot and tasty.  And a small cup of chili is actually pretty filling for me.  You can get onions and cheese added to the top if you want that option.  I'm not one to turn down cheese!  Yummy.    A good and quick lunch for me from Wendy's today! Yep, I'd get their flatbread sandwich again.", "Date": "2013-09-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ann", "ReviewID": "ki3c5u8QUSeCZf5MgDziGQ", "Overall": "1", "Content": "They cannot  include straws in the drive thru with two drinks and a frosty ?!?!
