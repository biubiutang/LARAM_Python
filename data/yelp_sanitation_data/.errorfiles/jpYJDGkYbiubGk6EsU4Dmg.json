Yes. Yes!  I could not wait to try Oso Ono...and last night my dreams came true :D I missed the Chase corner event because I was out of town but I knew that I had to make it to Town Square Fresh52 farmers market so I could catch them there.  Hubby was excited too and when we arrived...I almost sprinted to the truck :)  We both ordered smalls and size/price/value was AMAZING. Hubby ordered half mango half watermelon :)   Service was super duper nice and fast considering it was packed and there was a line :)  I ordered half lychee half tigers blood with mochi. Fluffy like a cloud...I could eat the lychee EVERYDAY!!!!!  I love how the flavors are not crazy fake nor super diabeetus special!

I have to say I regret not trying them sooner. They have the BEST shave ice I have EVER tasted! Even better than the ones in Hawaii, no lie! Their shave ice is shaved so nice it just comes out so soft and fluffy it melts in your mouth, no chewing or crunching involved! They have great island theme tropical flavors and a few unique ones too like Tiger Blood and Red Velvet. You can even get a scoop of ice cream on the bottom and add condensed milk if that's your thing!  The kids visiting on their summer vacation enjoyed it so much I had to take them again after they stalked them on twitter and instagram to find out where they were gong to be lol. I wish they had a store location cause I'd be there all the time!

Still as good as Snow Ono!  I've had them twice now and both times have been amazing.  With summer coming up I suggest you follow them on facebook, twitter, instagram, and any other social media they might have and track them down!  I first had them at Foodie Fest even though I told myself that I wasn't going to try any local food trucks.  I couldn't resist, they were consistent as when I had it last Tuesday but without a 45 min wait.  I recently had a regular with mango syrup and con chili powder sprinkled on top.  It was so good.  The staff is awesome and asked both times if I wanted more syrup to just stop on by and ask.    Good quality stuff, affordable thingys, and excellent customer service is always a recipe for a bright and successful business!

This time, they were at Tivoli Village for the Fall Harvest Festival, and it was pretty warm out, so we decided to cool off with some shave ice! They were out of a few flavors and toppings, but thank goodness not my usual-Tiger's Blood, which is their blend of strawberry, coconut, and watermelon syrups.  It was good and it helped cool me down, but it wasn't saturated evenly with syrup. The Inside and center were still all white, and while the service wasn't rude, it wasn't welcoming either. They looked like they were just going through the motions which are totally the opposite of the  Snow Ono Era ...I miss those days.   Still love the fine ice though,  and it would be awesome to see more natural fruit flavored syrups in he future like at HOPA and Your Kitchen back home on Oahu than the artificial stuff. It makes shave ice taste so much better...ALOHA!!!

The bus is back!  Please see http://www.yelp.com/biz/snow-ono-shave-ice-las-vegas-2  It's great to see some cool owners pick up where Marianne left off. The ice is just as fluffy and the flavors just as delicious. Today was only a small preview event, so the full complement of syrups wasn't there. Honestly, I was always overwhelmed by Snow Ono's myriad choices, so it was a welcome sight. But I'll be just as happy when some of the faves return.  One of the main reasons Snow Ono did so well was because of their excellent customer service. From what I witnessed today, it looks like Cherie and her family are keeping that spirit alive.

I dropped by after work to check them out. I remember enjoying Snow Ono Shave Ice during the last couple summers at food truck events. I'm happy that someone bought the bus from Marianne so that we can keep enjoying their delicious shave ice.  At the tasting event, I had half mango and half wedding cake. I wanted a contrast between the two flavors, but I think they are pretty similar. I hope to catch them again this summer to try more flavors. It gets so hot in Vegas, Oso Ono would be a great way to cool down.  It was also nice to meet the owner Cherie. She was very friendly and you could tell she's excited about their new family business.", "Date": "2013-03-30", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Shayne", "ReviewID": "cXI6a-CfutwD_OaJycvn0Q", "Overall": "5", "Content": "still the smoothest fluffiest shaved-ice I've had ... always come running back to  Oso Ono Shave Ice for great snow-like ice!

They pulled in a couple hours or so after the start of the event, which was kinda a mistake in my opinion because it got colder and colder as the autumn day waned.  Nevertheless, I wanted a dessert at the end of my day, so I braved the cold and chose these guys out of the dessert options because I remembered the favorable Yelp reviews. I had a medium(? - second largest size anyway) for $4 and asked for cantaloupe and lilikoi, no additional toppings. Couldn't tell ya whether I actually got those flavors, but what blew me away was how finely shaved their ice was in comparison to the shave ice I've had before. Really, really good mouth feel. Yum.

It's always a good thing to have something so icey cold when it gets hot from walking around all afternoon in the sun at the Fest. Pretty large selection of flavors and they also have add-ons such as condensed milk, azuki beans and ice cream. I inquired on how big the regular and large sizes looked and price. I couldn't find a price on the menu board. Suffice to say even the regular seemed pretty large and it was only $5 to boot. I had to go for the POG(Passion Orange Guava). That is one of my favorite juices growing up in Hawaii. A great combination that I suggest anyone to try at least once. The juice that is, but a flavored syrup is still good. The guy who made my pog shaved ice even told me if I needed more syrup to come back! Awesome! Upon tasting the shaved ice, I was surprised at the softness of the ice.

The owners were very friendly and so nice. They wanted my honest opinion and just chit chatted.   They took my order and a few others after me and it was soon realized that they had somehow lost my order. They quickly made this up to me and very apologetic.  We tried POG, Red Velvet, Grape, Cherry and Creamsicle. That POG was too die for. The ice was smooth and creamy and soaked up the flavors of the syrup oh so well. It didn't melt fast and it stayed the same from beginning to end.  I definitely am following them so I know where the truck is. I can't wait to make my way back.

My go-to is a small sized banana and cherry with mochi, red beans, topped with condensed milk--yum yum!

Dim the lights please.   Oso...Ono... Oo...soo..Oo..noooo. U so... ono. I like eat you right now cause is HOT.  Ok I guess I'm not poetic when it comes to shave ice.  Anyways Oso Ono Shave Ice is very good and with 100+ degree temp hitting the valley you have to keep cool some way.  I believe they took over the Snow Ono Shave Ice truck and doing their own spin on that, so if you enjoyed Snow Ono you're going to enjoy Oso Ono.  It's smooth, doesn't have that crushed ice texture like some other places here.  The ice and syrup didn't seem to separate. It's cold and delicious.  There are so many possible combinations you can come up with.  There's Tigerblood, Wedding Cake, POG, lychee, azuki beans, the list goes on.  Add condensed milk and some li hing mui.  I recommend everything.
