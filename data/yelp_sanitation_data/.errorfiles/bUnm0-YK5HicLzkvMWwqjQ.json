More importantly, I would have loved to have had a list of the ingredients used in the various flavors. While it is a personal issue that I am allergic to raw eggs, I would have liked to known there is raw egg in tiramisu.   Aside from this, the cashier may have been exhausted from a long day, however she appeared rude and less than happy my group arrived into the small shop.   For personal issues, I would not return, however the party I was with enjoyed it immensely.

(which is what eating gelato in 104 degree Vegas weather often feels like.)  I've been making Town Square mall my new home this trip thanks to the super cheap matinee movie tickets and fantastic end of season clothing sales. Amorino caught my eye as I made my rounds, and all the positive Yelp reviews secured its spot on the must try list. It's a little kiosk near the mall's center that virtually looks like all the others from the outside. Inside, it's got a warm elegant decor like I'd expect an Italian gelato store to have.  What makes this experience memorable is simply how effing fantastic the gelato is. It's cruel that a small, which gives you MAYBE 2-3 ounces of gelato costs $5.50. But when the flavors hit your tongue, you understand why they gouge your wallet. The creamy soft flavors of the pistachio and speculoos took it home for me. The Alphonso mango is a creamier, gentler version of the Talenti one, but pretty close all in all. Passion fruit was good, but not a knockout, which doesn't surprise me in the least since passion fruit is a tricky flavor to master. And the blood orange and tangerine one whose Italian name is too hard to remember, is shockingly tart, even for my citrus loving taste buds.  However, the dance of flavors on your tongue while you lounge outside under the umbrella covered tables and chairs near the aerial misting system, despite being a far too short minute in heaven, is an unforgettable one.", "Date": "2015-08-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Som", "ReviewID": "iCwDkdWh-IpNHkT3kUQR7Q", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I went here on Monday with some friends and had some of the gelato macarons - they were awesome!

My friends really enjoy the Amarena Cherry Gelato and I can certainly appreciate the quality of this product as well. I am a slightly more adventurous gelato eater and typically look for more experimenting in my gelato flavors, but Amorino does a great job with their standard flavors. It's the quality ingredients that set them apart...I just wish they broke away from their routine and were more creative with their flavors.  The kiosk is easily accessible is you're walking around in town square, but unless you come in off-peak hours it's not exceptionally easy to come in just for gelato and park close by.

I was excited to try them and ended up sampling a good number of items for good measure. Nearly $10 for a kid's cup of pistachio and raspberry along with two macarons of the same flavors, I wandered outside to a table to enjoy my treats.   The macarons didn't do much for me, even after the employees spoke so highly of them. Crumbly and a little on the overly sweet side. I set my focus on the gelato after this initial disappointment.   The pistachio had very little flavor and I didn't enjoy this flavor in the least, despite it typically being a favorite of mine. I finally got a taste of the raspberry and it was absolutely lovely. Tart, silky and perfect.   If I had ordered this only, it would have been an easy four stars, but given the other items I didn't enjoy, I feel I need to give them another try to get a better feel for their product.

I'm a stickler for time but she gave me samples of delicious gelato - she was redeemed. Eat all the gelato!!!

The chocolate hazelnut macaron gelato was a bit disappointing because it tasted more chocolatey and not enough hazelnut.  They also have crepes and waffles.

Not surprised they were having refrigeration issues.  So just half the selections were on display during this lingering 104 degree evening. Simple elegant rich display of gelatos with crystal chandelier overhead.  Chose the dark chocolate and deep colored raspberry packed into a medium sized waffle cone. Didn't realize that one can order as many flavors in a serving. Of course it becomes more difficult to distinguish the flavors when it's a small order or more than six flavors are chosen.  Like drinking Imperial green tea, refined gelato must pop in obvious flavor transcending from the tip of the tongue and all the way to the back of the mouth. Smooth, soft, dazzling in texture and in natural sexy flavors. Only the Italiano can perfect gelato.

The gelato is fantastic and everything else they serve is just as good (italian/french coffee, waffles, crepes, gelato macarons, and now croissants!!!)  Believe it or not, I am from France (where Amorino has now been the European standard for organic Gelato) and had to come to Vegas to finally try it. The place is very nice, well placed in the middle of the mall, very clean, has great decoration and plenty of seating spaces just outside of the ordering kiosk.  The 2 french guys running the shop could not be nicer (and I am sure ladies would also enjoy the fact that they are very good looking!). They let us sample every flavors we wanted and even a macaron which I am usually not a big fan of. I must say that a macaron with that gelato inside has changed the way I feel about macarons especially the strawberry one which was amazing. For gelato, the must haves are yogurt, stracciatella, nutella, salted caramel, and pistachio.  I had no issue with the pricing. It is not cheap but like everything else that is much better than the competition, there is a premium to pay for it (which I thought was not even that high). I AM SURE THAT MORE THAN HALF THE PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE PRICES OWN AN I-PHONE AND SOMEHOW HAVE NO PROBLEM RATIONALIZING THE MUCH HIGHER PREMIUM THEY PAID FOR IT.

I find it conveniently located in  Town Square so once shopping is done or for an in between treat this makes for a perfect stop.  First I am a huge fan of Amarena Cherries, so having this as one of their many flavors was exciting news for me.     The flavors are very enjoyable and the consistency is probably some of the smoothest I have tried.   And what a way to food travel by enjoying their delicious waffle cones straight from Paris.     If you order a cone, you will get to see them try to build a rose, which looks incredibly difficult but definitely eye pleasing. Plus you mix match flavors regardless of size.  I will say the only issue I find with this design is that it makes for inconsistency with the portion size of your cone, but selecting a cone is still the way to go.   They also offer waffles, macarons, specialty coffees, and twenty something flavors of hot chocolate.   The pricing I will say is a little up there but I can say for the quality it is definitely worth it.  Service has also been very pleasant so far.

Sticker shock. Amorino a-Gelato.  OK, maybe I took a little creative license to achieve that alliteration. I'll try to be straightforward with the rest.  **This tip is out of order because I don't want you to feel as awkward as I did: they want you to pick a size and pay first, even before sampling + ordering gelato.**  If you check Town Square map, you'll find Amorino in the hexagon marked as  1.  The walk is manageable from any parking area, but I think the best spot is the South Parking garage near Miller's Alehouse. If you take Las Vegas Blvd from the Strip, turn right toward the Fry's and Whole Foods. From the highway, get to the leftmost lane and take the overpass. After you walk down the alley from the garage to the center of Town Square, look to the left. You'll find this place near Brio's outdoor seats. It amounts to a glorified hut, but with plenty of patio umbrella tables outside.  If you're really lucky, business might be temporarily so slow that an employee may stand outside their door with small ~1.5 oz sample cups. Well, at least it's more than a few bites. The mango sorbetto was fantastic and resembled the fruit so closely in color and flavor. The stracciatella gelato was somehow halfway melted in all the samples, but it was alright.  Prices range from $5.50-$14 (copied off of Nelson, thanks), and there's other options such as crepes and gelato-filled macarons. They claim to allow as many samples as you want and as many different flavors in your order as you'd like, but I didn't really test their limits.  In terms of samples, I had both vanilla offerings (the one from Tahiti has a more subtle flavor than the one from Madagascar), tiramisu (quite full of coffee), amarena (tasty but not compelling), passion fruit (excellent), and strawberry (true to the fruit, albeit sweetened).  My order was a grande cup (~6 oz for an astonishing $9.19 after tax). Aside from getting more mango, I had a few other flavors. The hazelnut (nocciola) was rich in the namesake flavor and came with an actual crunchy hazelnut. The raspberry was as impressive (and  creamy  yet milk-less) as all of the fruit sorbetti were. The yogurt had almost as cheesecake-like flavor as one employee mentioned, but it might be the only one I wouldn't order in the future. They topped off my order with a mini waffle cone (their take on the wafer cookie), which was pretty much only useful for the crunch.  Overall, Amorino is a premium experience that gelato lovers must try at least once. Quality texture, assertive flavors, and by far the most expensive gelato I've had in recent memory (Strip-like pricing, in my opinion). I can't give it a full 5 stars yet because (1) I've had marvelous gelati around town at more reasonable prices, and (2) it does not seem like a place that will churn out experimental flavors.", "Date": "2015-03-16", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ramsey", "ReviewID": "uJyMl3-nvD8r-ZrNmy6BcQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "We checked out Amorino on a sunny Saturday afternoon.

It was crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside and tasted great. Plus the ice cream, chocolate sauce and whipped cream added to the deliciousness.

Pay  4. Then you can tell me what flavor gelato you want.  Don't make the mistake like I did and tell employee the flavors you want before step #3. Otherwise you'll get that  you're an idiot  stare.

It is light and refreshing, but somehow still dense and decandent, I go with the fruit flavors and had mango, strawberry and passionfruit here, shaped into a beautiful flower on a waffle cone. I think the prices are fair, as are the portions for the quality and presentation you are getting. Service is fantastic, one of my favorite places to get dessert, I will be back next time I am in Vegas again!", "Date": "2015-09-15", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Stefany", "ReviewID": "IRFrHnbRLRzfbaj8CTVkzw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Think of all of the delicious, delicate desserts and confections the French make. They're pretty well known for their sweets, with an emphasis on presentation, so their end product is as visually pleasing as it is tasty. They also have a penchant for pricing their goods a bit higher, yeah?  Enter Amorino- surprisingly nestled in a nondescript kiosk at Town Square, you'll find several jaw-droopingly good flavors of french gelato, served by fresh-from-Paris staff (complete with accent!), great coffee, and perhaps most excitingly, maracons al gelato- that's right. Macarons stuffed with gelato. They're downright decadent.  Staff is happy for you to sample as many flavors as you want- I loved all of them in different ways, from the chocolate sorbetto to the pistachio and caramel. The vanilla rum macaron was my favorite bite of the night...  But those French like profiting from your sweet tooth. The 2/$5 macaron price tag might shock your tastebuds right off. Adding on a small Americano and a small cup of gelato (carefully scooped and shaped into a flower!) will bring your total to $16- a bit steep for dessert, but the quality is really high.", "Date": "2015-01-23", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "H3kUkncdMEFWBjHGG0Chdw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Amazing every single time. ....

The price might be higher than some people want to pay, but you get what you pay for...and this is high quality, gourmet stuff imported from France that you can't get anywhere else in Vegas.  The yogurt tastes like cheesecake or cream cheese frosting.  The mango is like eating a frozen mango.  It's crazy good.  Everywhere else is a downgrade.  Looking forward to the grand opening of their second location at the outlet mall!", "Date": "2015-05-03", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Debbie", "ReviewID": "O7iV7mdNUV5S7suuBZfj3w", "Overall": "4", "Content": "High quality Gelato in Town Square!  Exactly what they needed!  Seriously.   My favorite flavors are:   Mango - the best and mango-est flavor ever. Better and sweeter than a regular mango. And bonus that you don't get Mango hairs stuck between your teeth   Straciatella - My usual favorite flavor is vanilla.... but when you add thin layers of chocolate shell for the added texture and crunch, it's a treat!   Check out the photos and you will see the cones come looking like a rose flower. It's cute for a date.  Also, if you really wanted to, they will make a cone with all of their flavors. It's takes a bit of time and it may be messy to eat, but it's fun to watch them do it!   In addition, they have options when it's colder outside: Hot Chocolate! 12 different flavors. We've only tried the spicy hot chocolate, but we will be back to try the thick European version.   Fun fact: They ship everything in from Europe. Ask them about it.", "Date": "2015-03-24", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jennifer", "ReviewID": "texbvoG1xHLzEck4qd4jRg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Best gelato in town - hands down. Sure some might complain that they dont have a ton of different flavors - but that really doesnt matter when every single flavor that they do have is off the charts amazing. The kind of gelato where every mouthful just tastes incredible and you cant believe that gelato can ever taste this good. Get a few scoops and go sit in the park and enjoy. Its worth every cent (its quite expensive).", "Date": "2015-03-17", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Tommy", "ReviewID": "3t89yIJTjsYnT9j3pXimlA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Yummy yummy gelato.. I think im  just loving that they make these little flowers when you get a cone here. thats what sets them aprt from the other ice cream gelato places. i will say the prices are pretty expensive but its really worth it.

I used to frequent Amorino in New York, the unique presentation and quality made it my favorite gelato spot. The vegas location compared in quality bit definitely lacks in presentation.  During my visit I requested a medium size cone and picked 5 different flavors: tiramisu, pistachio, hazelnut, amarena and banana sorbet. As the young lady worked on my cone, she made a center and 4 petals, one for each flavor. The tiny petals didn't even completely cover the center, it made no sense to me as I know Amorino values presentation. This may sound petty but I'm not only paying for quality gelato, there are several great gelato spots in Vegas, I fell in love with the shop for quality and attention to detail. If you're not even going to attempt to have your product represent the brand, why even bother making the cone into a  flower ? I actually asked the girl (for lack of a better term) if the one petal per flavor is a standard and she said, yes... If in fact was telling the truth and its standard practice, then quality means very little when you're not delivering what patrons pay for.  I think next time I crave Amorino, I will hold out until my next trip home. Oh and you can go to New York Amorino's yelp page to see what this ship is supposed to be delivering.", "Date": "2015-02-16", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
