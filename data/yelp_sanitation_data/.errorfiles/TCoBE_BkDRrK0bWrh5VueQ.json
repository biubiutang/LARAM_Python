Alpastor, yes please. cut right off onto my freshly grilled tortillas topped with some onion and cilantro a little sauce and some pineapple... It was great. We also picked up some corn in one of the many lines to choose from when you go up to order and we decided to get it mexican street style, now not to downplay the alpastor tacos but the Mexican street style corn was the highlight, perfectly cooked sweet corn with all the fixins is enough to make you come back for more. The salsa bar also had some great options and I would definitely recommend the habanero salsa.  Now, lets get to the few things I was not see excited about.  1.) Pick a line any line- If you want an alpastor taco and a carnita taco it is in two separate lines and then if you need to pick up some corn you have to get in another line.  2.) Pay for your meal- Yes it is another line, It really reminded me of a college cafeteria, walk the line get what you want and then the dude in the hairnet at the end will ring you up.  3.) Cleanliness- most of the tables in the dining area had not been wiped down or cleaned and it just made the entire place seem dirty.

This is the best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to. The food and selection here is amazing. There's numerous lines that sell different items. Personally for me I love burritos and nachos which you order near the cash register area. For my choice of meat I like to get Cabeza aka head. Head sounds like a really odd choice of meat but trust me, this is the best head you'll ever get.

They offer happy hour and Sunday brunch which I have yet to try. I freaking just love their tacos. I gave up beef and pork for Lent, so once Easter came around, this was the spot I chose to break my meat fast.   They offer a variety of meats for tacos, burritos and bowl. My favorite is the al pastor tacos. You have to get them fully loaded with pineapple. Yes, I said pineapple. Salty and sweet amazingness! Their salsa bar is legit with about 10 different salsas to fulfill everyone's tastes. The salsa bar also has beans, grilled onions, cucumbers and radishes.

The menu is the same (with the exception of the drink menu, of course) and service is still stationary, where you approach separate counters for different things, but is just as friendly. Don't be afraid to ask questions!  On special occasions, like Cinco De Mayo, they have live mariachi music & awesome specials.

Eastern is always poppin with food places. My friends love this place and wanted to bring me. So i came and i could not decide what to order!!! I had such a hard time but i finally chose the carne asada fries because that is what everyone said was really good. I LOVE CARNE ASDA FRIES. Right now i am working to become a Ranch connoisseur. And after i aspire to be a carne asada fries connoisseur. So i chose that and i was not a fan at all. I would not order the fries again. Two stars because I did not like the actual fries because they were too potatoey and felt undercooked. I did not think the meat had much flavor, and even the guacamole was just bland. So i was very disappointed. I know what you guys are thinking  why would you get carne asada fries at a taco place?  That is a fair point but even so I would expect any item on the menu to be good. I think the restaurant is only good as their weakest dish. Idk i think it makes sense. The meat on my fries still gave me an idea what their meat tastes like overall. I am still willing to come back and try some other menu items, i do want try some tacos but for now i am not a fan.", "Date": "2016-07-21", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ryan", "ReviewID": "mDkNWo8G_J7moJ-bh4UNpw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Awesome place to try out!

It's a little hard to communicate with the workers there since they don't really speak English well and whenever you want to ask them a question they only say no or yes when I specifically asked what kind of cheese they have, twice.   But don't get me wrong, the food is better than the average so just try it. I ordered a burrito with guac and extra meat and it came out to 15-17 dollars.

It has ample searing including an upstairs area that's a chill dimly light area to hang with friends and grab some drinks.   Ordering can be kind of Tricky since there's different lines for different menu items. We came on a Tuesday and had no idea about happy hour. They offer $5 chicken nachos and tacos 3 for $2 carnitas tacos no substitutions. They also have specials on drinks and have a bar area to order drinks and a limited seating area. I love the gran tacos so I ordered one of those nachos to share and tacos for my friend. The nachos are fully loaded and they don't skimp on anything. I've sampled most of the menu items from the other location. Al pastor if you're a fan is very good it's joy a favorite of mine but it is good. Also the tripas are good and the carne Asada fries have to be my favorite in town hands down. What makes them the best is that the fries are super crispy the guacamole is freshly made (not premade) and they actually grill their carne over an open flame giving the meat more flavor.

She steamed my flour tortilla, added my options then rolled it and placed it in a grill so it was slightly crispy & warm~ just heavenly to me.

It had been on my list literally since it opened. This is the spot that used to be another restaurant, and they did rather little to the interior and decor to alter it.  For first timers, the setup can be quite confusing. There is no signage or formed lines/barricades directing you (like at Cafe Rio or somewhere). And that left us frazzled and complaining from the start. Some rope and an  order here  sign would go a long way.  So here's how it works: There are 4 areas. One for al pastor, one for a bunch of other meats, one for carne asada, and one for nachos and all other items (in that order, from left to right). Approach what you want and order. Slide down with your tray and keep ordering until you are done and/or reach the cashier. You can get each meat as a taco, a mula, a vampiro, or a couple of other ways. Mulas and vampiros are essentially meat between two tortillas with cheese and other toppings. Mula = soft. Vampiro = crunchy.  Once we figured it out, after approaching the cashier and asking, we got in one of the lines, received a tray, and began placing our order. We had, honestly, never heard of mula or vampiro, so we had to have those explained to us - which was simply showing us a picture. Not particularly helpful, but we felt adventurous. We opted for an al pastor mula and al pastor vampiro. We then proceeded to order the mole fries - sweet potato fries with chicken, cheese, and mole sauce.  The mula and vampiro were good and reasonably priced. The al pastor was quite tasty and seasoned perfectly with loads of flavor. The mole fries were expensive and a left down. You got a lot of them, but they totally lacked flavor.  We also got an order of just chips so we could try out their salsa bar. They had several different salsas and all were tasty. The habanero was easily my favorite. None of the  hot  salsas were actually all that spicy.  All in all, it was an a-ok meal and experience. I think now that we know the process and what everything is, we will have a better experience if we return. In short, the al pastor was super tasty and authentic.

I decided to try out their new location today. So you know it's good.  Had an al pastor and shrimp burrito because I wanted to get crazy. The meat is so tender and juicy, the burrito fillings all hit the right spots and they melt the cheese on the tortilla before making the burrito. It's great.   If you don't know any better you'd be confused by the ordering system, as there are different stations for different items. I'm sure they'll figure out a better way to do this, but there's not just not one big line, there's a crowd of ravenous humans grouped up trying to figure out which meat or taco station they're supposed to be at so they can fill their fat faces.   The salsa bar, which houses 7 or 8 different sauces/salsas, is great. I'm a sauce kind of guy. I like to try many different salsas on my meal, so thank you for saucing me up. The salsa bar also houses cucumbers, pickled carrot/jalapeños, but my favorite part is the fact they have their grilled onions and jalapeños refilled here instead of ordering behind the counter.  Last but not least I also had elote which is the mexican street style corn on the cob, mayo, cotija cheese and chili pepper. I don't think I would come here and not order that. Although the other location when I went had the white corn(which I prefer), this location had yellow corn, but good nonetheless.  This location also has a bar.  Aesthetically, this location could use some work, as I'm not sure what they're going for. By no means does it look bad, just needs work and nothing that can't easily be fixed.

After I quickly received my tacos with everything, decided to try out their Elote (Mexican style street corn) as many have raved on how good it was.   After paying and getting some sauces (medium and hot - habanero and green tomatillo) with some sliced radishes and limes, sat down and ate.   None of the sauces were spicy, to my surprise. Even the so called habanero one wasn't all that spicy. The meats were flavored pretty well tho a little over tender for the buche and lengua.   The elote was overly soft. I expected fresher cooked corn? Kind of reminds me of those ud get at fast food joints or buffets where its overly soft. Would have preferred more cheese and spice. Maybe I should try making this at home...

FOOD: Al Pastor Taco (Station #4) - Delicious!  good pork favor and the toppings made it just right  Al Pastor Vampiro (Station #2) - Really good however i didnt even know what a Vampiro was.. there was no signs to describe it and no one could tell me what it was.  Vampiro is pretty much of a sandwich made of 2 hard corn tortilla, cheese, meat selection, onions, and salsa.     Lengua Taco (Station #3) - meh, it was okay.  The tongue lacked favored and need to have that seared crispy to make it really good.   SERVICE:  The layout of the open kitchen, signs, and where the food trays are is kind of deceptive.  When you walk in it seems similar to Chipotle/Subway, where you start at one end and make your way down to the cashier.   There are actually 5 lines (Nachos/Burrito line, Station #2 Line, Station #3 Line, Station #4 Line, and the Cashier ).  However the food trays are located only next to Station 4 which makes everyone form a huge line.  You stand in line for whichever type of food you want and than you go to the cashier to pay.    The staff is polite and some are friendly the only problem is that no one explains what anything is... like a Vampiro vs. Mula vs. Tostada.  All the meats are listed and there are some you know off the bat just due to seeing it your whole life... but there are some i've never seen before.  When i ordered the Al Pastor Taco, the guy asked me if i wanted everything on it, I asked what is  everything  and he just looked at me.

While the restaurant is much nicer than one would expect, the tacos are pretty average. I had the al pastor and the carne asada  I felt that both meats were lacking flavor. They have a large salsa bar which is probably there to compensate for the bland fillings. Even for street tacos I found the portions to be really small. I could easily have eaten 5 of them and at $2+ a pop, the $ adds up.

When we were done eating I looked at the receipt and saw a $100 service charge added to our $28 bill. I took it to the cashier who got a manager. They looked for my signed receipt but couldn't find it. That seems fishy to me; it had only been about 15 minutes since we paid and the receipts were all in a rubber band in the cash register. Somehow mine, with the extra $100 tip, is missing?  The manager didn't seem clear on how to fix it but said he did so I'll wait and see what comes through my account tomorrow. He technically said  sorry  but it didn't seem like a real apology to me. I realized on the way home that they also overcharged us for the carnitas tacos. 3/$5.50 is not $1/each. It's only $2.50 but they should know what their specials are and charge appropriately.

Add an ear of corn and all the trimmings (like the  elote man  from the park in the hood).   3. Pay   4. Add your salsa fixings from the salsa station and load up on the limes    5.

If you happen to go when it's packed and there are a hundred people standing around in a crowd in front of all the lines you might not know what to do. But when there's no one, it's kind of easy to make sense of it all.   Ok here's how it works so there are 3 main lines but basically it's like one big line where you get to choose from a list of different meats in different style in each like. You let the guys know how much of what you want and how you want it. For instance the 1st line served up Alpastor right off of the spinner in a taco, tostada or vampiro style. The 2nd line has your more unique choices like chicharron chili or tripas (my favorite) and the 3rd line us your Asada, carnitas etc. and the main 4th line has everything you want to order, burritos, Asada fries, nachos quesadilla, Elote and more.   They also have a full bar and on most days a live DJ spinning some top tunes or edm which makes for hanging out and eating great tacos fun and entertaining. There are 2 stories at this locations and a sweet open outdoor patio. The tacos are absolutely worth it. About $2.50 a taco the price can add up quick. Stick to the tacos. They are small and you can't go wrong with any choice of meat. I like the Vampiro style meaning(your choice of meat sandwich in between 2 fried tortilla with melted cheese and mango salsa) it's good but nothing beats the classic little soft corn tortilla with all the toppings. Just the way I like my street tacos with the cilantro, onions and whatever other goodness they top it with.   I tried the Mole fries with regular not sweet potato fries and it wasn't my favorite I think it was the mole. Not bad just too sweet for me it was weird all around I think. They have this salsa bar with so much to choose from and plus they got cooked whole beans all for free. The chips were in house made chips for sure. They were crunchy, crispy salted and warm. The Elote was ok I lexpected a lot more flavor but it was just slightly sweeten and the mayo, cheese & chili didn't do much. But it was still pretty good. The tacos were all dreaming bomb dot com. Not crazy about the Alpastor Vampiro I got but the meat itself was juicy and fatty and full of flavor.

MULAS - pretty much a taco sandwich made from flour tortilla instead of corn. I like it with the extra cheesyness  & the softness of the flour tortilla.  CARNE ASADA TACO - this is a small taco like two bites & done   QUESO FRESCO GRAN TACO - vegetarian selection, but the Gran Taco is the typical taco size with the cheese melted between the 2 tortillas   CORN ON A STICK - that mexican street corn lathered in the butter & drenched with cheese... they are definately not shy with the cheese which I believe is the best part of mexican food!  CHIPS & GUACAMOLE - love the chips since they are made there & the guacamole full of flavor  JIMAICA DRINK - this is HONESTLY the best JIMAICA juice that comes closest to the ones that my BOH kitchen coworkers used to make it when they brought the dried plant back from mexico!

It was in her section. Then, the dude that was preparing some of my other tacos in another section asked her. When I reached her a second time (Note: no one else was ordering from her at the time), she had not made it, or thought about making it, and imagined she would be making it in the near-future. I had to practically plead with her a third/fourth fucking time to prepare me a goddamn taco. Seriously?  How one orders is not the only absurdity at Taco Y Taco.

The freshly hand made tortillas were good. I like how the carne asada came with guacamole in addition to the cilantro and onions. Had a bite of of hubby's chorizo taco. It was good, but a bit salty.

One thing that is very apparent is the competition in the trendy restaurant business. We have so many choices and the one thing they should all have a heightened awareness of is consistency, quality and outstanding, superior customer service.  Customer service is the one characteristic alone that we all know brings repeat business to a restaurant. This place certainly gives you a feeling of uncertainty.    I never write reviews about restaurants but rather give my opinion by word of mouth.  To me it holds more value to personally tell someone an experience, there is a loss of interpretation from reading about it, however my experience at this place was totally beyond unacceptable.  So I had to create this account with YELP just so I could tell the public what a lousy, unfriendly, confusing experience I had.  1 )  First impression After seeing the hand written sign in the window and waiting for months to try this place I am so disappointed I in my experience. When you walk in to the place there is no sense of direction as to where to start, where to order and no one to greet you or answer questions. Everyone is meandering around trying to figure out how to order their food, one customer asking another do I do?? If they wanted to convey the sense of wandering the streets of a foreign country with street vendors selling food; well they definitely accomplished their goal. I felt like I was at the Swap Meet in North Las Vegas. You have to be a leader and form your own line or be the one to tell everyone else what they have to do to order food, after 5 -10 minutes of deciphering the menu boards that are hung behind the cooks   2)  The Food  The tacos were below standard in taste. I had to try 2 of each and the flavors all blended together. There were no real distinct flavors between any of the meets except the Chorizo, it was ok but they are all very small.  I would have been much happier going to Super Burrito than to eat the greasy bland tacos at this place. .  A specialty dish Mole Smothered Fries was displayed with a 8x11 piece of paper, hand written with No Price, and no direction as to who takes the order. I inquired about the special to the closet server to the sign and he had to go ask someone else, he said What Special?? Finally a different server asks me what I needed so I had to repeat myself and he had to get someone else to get it. I did not have a good feeling about what I was going to get since they did not even know about the special. Needless to say it was the worst Mole I ever tasted and had enough salt in it to last me a month. 3) Customer Service & Price So after eating some of the tacos and smothered fries I bought, I needed another beer. So I looked at my receipt and discovered I was charged $7.00 for a draft beer. I asked the cashier was there a mistake and she had to ask the bartender, he confirmed it was $7. he also said the bottle beer was $3.00 and it was happy hour. Well no one told me it was happy hour and it was not posted for anyone to see. But the one thing that was startling to me was that in the whole beer drinking world the normal Tap Beer  is served at happy hour prices.  So I ask for the manager and an insensitive young lady struts over to my table with an attitude and from her introduction has no manager or professional business skill to begin with.  I explained to her what the situation was and she walked away to reprint my receipt she returned only to reiterate what I already knew.  There was no apology for the lack of customer service from the cashiers not telling people it was happy hour and bottle beer was cheaper. There was no empathy but rather a unprofessional arrogant attitude.   If I would have experienced one shred of concern or a slight sense or knowledge of customer service from anyone in that Tacos Y Tacos I probably never would have written this review. Yes it's fresh and it is grilled, but there is also Fresh and Crappy taste and service which this place exemplifies!!

Stepping up to to the line #2 I was greeted by two very friendly employees. I ordered 2 gran tacos al pastor. The gran tacos come with 2 soft corn tortillas that have melted monterey jack cheese between them, then the al pastor, black beans, pico, avocado and sour cream. Aboslutely delicious! It was definately one of the best tacos I have ever eaten.  We also ordered a side of chips and guac which at $3.75 was a steal. These are real chips, you can tell made in house and guac was delicious. While waiting for our food we hit the amazing salsa bar. It has everything you can imagine! 8 different salsa's, fresh limes, radishes, pickled carrots and peppers and grilled onions & peppers. The grilled onions were so sweet and yummy.

But there is nothing special about it.  There was meat and salsa on small tortillas and one burnt tostada shell.  That's it.  Granted, I could have probably had them add other stuff to this, but unfortunately, as you have read in the other reviews, you have to stand in line for everything you want and that includes just wanting a little cheese.  After 5 minutes of the guy building some nachos and discussing family member and how great the restaurant was, I gave up and decided to forego the cheese.

I also got an elote--the first time I've had this at a Mexican restaurant.  I am a fan of this street food for sure.  The tacos were good.  I got everything on the al pastor and the pineapple tends to overwhelm the rest of the taco.  I also dumped a fair amount of their hottest salsa on, so tasting for details wasn't too much of an option.  I got the Vampiro with carnitas.  The server grabbed a large piece of pork that was simmering in some nice juices and sliced away to put in the Vampiro.  This was very tasty and I'm glad I got it.  As for the elote, I really am a fan.  The cotija and then dusting with Mexican chili powder make for a great taste combination.  Last night was Mariachi Monday and there was a Mariachi band playing in the foyer and just inside the restaurant for about the first hour I was there.  It did make conversation a bit difficult but it added to the atmosphere.  The restaurant has a partial second floor which gives you more options for sitting.  However, when you forget something, like getting a drink and some plastic utensils, it's down the steps and back up again.  Better to get your hunger on a bit more.

I may be picky sometimes, but when it comes to meats, I try to be an adventurous eater, particularly when visiting one close friend of mine in Vegas who is like.... Andrew Zimmern status. We had been debating between going to Taco Y Taco or Tacos El Gordo (which I have been to, many years ago) this visit, but Taco Y Taco was the obvious choice when it was decided I needed to try the cabeza tacos.  We arrived around 5:30-6 on a late Friday afternoon and it wasn't busy at all. Lots of reviewers have complained about how confusing and complicated the ordering system is with the three lines, and I do see that when it's busy, but since there were no others in line when we went, it was a breeze. We went to the one line we needed, but while there, the guy making our tacos asked if we wanted anything from either of the other two lines while we were there.  My friend ordered 6 tacos - 3 cabeza (head) and 3 tripas. Get the tripas crispy! It makes it the texture of super light, crispy fried chicken skin! Normally, when found in pho or at Korean bbq, i hate tripe, but my friend had be try a piece and crispy in these tacos, I loved it.  I got 3 tacos for myself - cabeza, suadero (meat from between the cow's belly and leg) and lengua (tongue).  The cabeza was great, but the pieces of meat were shredded so, so tiny, it was hard to get a real meaty flavor amidst the onions and cliantro in the taco. This was the one meat that I added some salsa to, but it complimented it perfectly. SIDEBAR: the salsa bar is huge! I'm a big baby for spicy stuff so I only tried one mild salsa, the chunkiest one on the end closest to the taco lines) and it was really great with the cabeza. I also didn't want to get much salsa since I wanted to really just savor the flavor of the meats I was eating.  I had never had nor tried suadero before walking into Taco Y Taco. I was curious as to what it was, and upon seeing where in the cow it was from, I knew I had to try it. I love fish bellies and pork belly, why wouidn't I like cow belly? It was tender and sweet and flavorful. I could have easily had a few suadero tacos. No salsa necessary.  Lengua, sweet, sweet lengua, meat of my dreams. Beef tongue is one of my favorite meats at any Korean bbq (when it's available) and lengua tacos are probably my favorite street tacos. Lengua is such a smooth, melt in your mouth meat that I just want to feed it to all my friends (without telling them what it is first so that they aren't scared).

The first burrito I got from them was late at night on the way home from driving back from SF... perhaps it was close to closing time, so the reason the food was so salty and dry was because it was late and it had been sitting? The burrito was salty as hell, with no real freshness to any of the flavors. My second visit, I was on my way driving out to SF, around noon. I ordered a burrito again (easier to eat in the car). I ordered pork as the meat (which - btw the meat options for burritos are not clearly laid out on the menus - if you want a meat option they offer for the tacos, you have to look over at the taco line menus and specifically ask for it)... they offer  cilantro-style  rice (which - if I wanted that, I'd just patronize Chipotle) and Spanish style rice, and all the other standard burrito ingredients... but I'm pretty sure every single ingredient they have, rice, guac, pico, beans, meat, all have added salt in each. I could practically feel my skin shrivel in the desert dryness and my blood pressure rise to 180/90 about half way through my burrito. The worst part: the pork was so dehydrated and dead, they might as well have thrown shredded beef jerky in there and called it a day. Also, the burrito was pinner, and it was TEN BUCKS.", "Date": "2015-04-10", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Audrey", "ReviewID": "r_wdp2NAKtT8box7oGFUcQ", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Honestly, I used to like eating there but my most recent experience was so bad. I understand that it may be hard to hear behind the counter, but I had to constantly ask the employee what kind of meat it was.

She was rude and she made the rest of our order carelessly, not to mention, she picked the meat for us just because she was too irritated to talk to us anymore. Then later when we went to go pay, she went ahead & talked about us in a very rude way, in spanish, & I know this because I do, in fact, understand spanish, but she seemed like she didn't know that.

This is not your typical american mexican restaurant but rather it is designed to be an authentic taqueria.  Set up with stations where you can get al pastor, tacos, burritos, and specialty items, you get your tray, pick your items, some are warmed up right in front of you, and then pay per item.  The items are reasonably priced with the average taco priced around $2.25.  It is served up cafeteria style, meaning the food is already preprepared and only a little warming up on the griddle is necessary.  I expected the food to be dried out having been premade but it was surprisingly tender and moist. There are TV's around the room so you don't miss the big game.  There is a small bar as well.  The staff is friendly but to be honest, I could barely understand what the servers were offering me.  It is a good idea to know what the different foods names are before you go in, or speak spanish.

So many different eateries I go to, I understand the delivery system. Self-serve, buffet, seat yourself, order/pay at counter then take that thingamajig number to your table, and of course my favorite, full wait help service! But at Taco y Taco, I look at the menu board, see the different ordering stations, the cashier to the side, and I don't understand! I do understand, I just don't see how it's a good system.   So if I wanted an Al Pastor taco, I stand and wait in that line, then if I want a quesadilla for my son, I wait in this other line, order, and wait for that.  Which line is to order the corn? Each station has a couple of guys back in that general area, but you don't know who takes what order, you just wait till someone asks you or make eye contact with one. So finally, I pile all my food onto a tray and make it to the cashier line, wait, pay, then wait at the salsa bar line. Yes, I'm serious. Hallelujah, I finally get to sit, only to realize I forgot my napkins. Where's the napkins line?  I've tried this location twice. I won't review the food, because I don't think I've tasted enough of these tacos elsewhere to know how good they are comparatively. Food was ok, I don't crave any to go back in a hurry. Plus, I've heard about their recent health demerits.   I appreciate  the music and the vibe, and that they offer vegetarian options. I liked sitting upstairs and prices are reasonable. Will I be back? Probably not. I'm not on the Taco y Taco bandwagon, but I'm ok with that.

The first and last time I remember stepping in here was at our Black and White Elite Event back in 2011 when it was Republic.  The folks at Taco y Taco have transformed this spot into the hippest looking taqueria  you'll ever step foot in. I think what attracts people here are cleanliness. location, and convenience. Taste is first and foremost to me, and when it comes down to flavor, it's just okay for me. Having Al Pastor'd and Tripa'd well over 100 times, these are my go-to fillings when it's taco time,as well as cabeza and lengua. I will say that the guys putting together your order are very helpful and will ham it up when you snap a picture!  Other good things I've seen here...the asada is done over an open flame, their tasty horchata is made from scratch and not the nasty packaged mix(free refills too!) and I like the offerings at the salsa bar. Not much of a fan of the cafeteria style ordering though, because from the time you hit up the al pastor guy, then the vampiro guy, get your burrito and street corn from the next station, then pay, then get your sides, salsas and drinks, your food will be stone cold like Steve Austin, whereas at a vendor, you order from one person, the cooks get your order out quickly, and you can enjoy your order hot, and all on one plate.

Unfortunately, the results were decidedly mixed.  October 4th is one of those so-called holidays dedicated to a specific food, and this restaurant decided to celebrate it by offering all non-seafood tacos for $1.00 (normal price $2.25). Having eaten a lot of tacos at other places since my previous review, I approached this as an opportunity to try a multitude of the meats available here. The lone exception was the reasonably tasty carnitas (tender pork) because I'd eaten my fair share of those on their Mexican Independence Day celebration at the OG Taco y Taco. I would have skipped the al pastor also if my friend hadn't gotten too full too quickly.  I actually went here for both lunch and dinner, which was necessary for me to have the stomach space for everything. I was going to describe the two meals separately, but I'll list what I ate from the best to the worst (with line breaks to separate tiers). Note that not all of the options will be appealing to all palates.  ==========  - Buche (pork stomach): probably the best rendition that I've eaten, bursting with flavor and juices.  - Tripas (beef intestine): about as strongly flavored as any tripas I've had here or anywhere else. - Barbacoa (tender beef): I wonder if this has the fatty bits that are normally served with cabeza. It was pretty good overall, and I'd order it again. - Al pastor (marinated pork): flavorful, but still not as good as one particular local taco stand. It's still pretty good, although the pineapple was a bit too acidic.. - Cesos (beef brain): distinguished by the almost creamy texture, and no sign of prions so far  - Cochinita pibil (roasted/marinated pork): tasty marinade, but too chewy. - Chicharron (pork rinds): this actually lacked the crunchy stuff that my friend reports usually getting when ordering it, so it was just a rather spicy, marinated, and overall intensely flavored pork. It packs a punch that I'm not that interested in.  - Pollo (chicken): surprisingly good, but chicken isn't that unique naturally, there wasn't a special marinade to lend any flavor, and most people go to taco places for beef and pork, not chicken. - Carne asada (grilled/marinated beef steak): pretty good, but not as impressive as what I've had elsewhere in Vegas. - Chorizo (pork sausage): served as finely ground meat instead of as a cut sausage, so the texture was disappointing. The flavor was average at best.  - Lengua (beef tongue): significantly tougher to chew than it should be, suggesting that it's been overcooked or wasn't cut properly. - Cabeza (head meat): boring compared to past experiences with this meat, seemed to lack all the fatty bits that provide flavor and typically make it a can't-miss option. - Suadero (a beef cut from near the udder): the one I was served was simply too dry and chewy.  ==========  In addition to the unfortunate issues in various meats, I found another problem. By the time I had seated myself and readied myself to eat the tacos, I found that the tacos as a whole were merely warm and approaching lukewarm. Yep, on both visits.  I think this happened because of the inherently flawed ordering/paying system: they'll prep the food first, then you'll most likely have to wait to pay (I did wait, twice), then you'll spend more time filling beverages and obtaining lime wedges, salsas, etc., and finally you get to sit down and start to eat. My currently preferred taco joints in town ask you to pay first, then allow you to do other things while waiting for the tacos. When the tacos are ready at these places, you'll be done with all of the other time-consuming tasks, so the tacos won't be too cold. As with most foods, tacos simply don't taste as good after they've cooled down.  By the way, I'm still not cool with the prices for the standard meats being that higher than the standard $2.00. What's next, a bump to $2.50? Let's hope not.  I saw too many flaws today. I'm no longer comfortable with giving Taco y Taco anything more than a 3-star rating. I've already been reluctant to return, and based on my observations, I'll continue to limit my visits here to sales (holiday promos, happy hours or Taco Tuesdays) and occasional invitations by friends.", "Date": "2015-10-05", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Michelle", "ReviewID": "v4PMO7CULcEP9IVLZW6oKg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Yummmmm best michelada/ red beer in town!

It was a mess and nobody knew where each line was going. My second complaint would have to be the tea.

After we stood in multiple lines to get an array of tasty tacos we headed upstairs to chow down. And boy was it delicious!

They had a Mexican dance performance since it was cinco de mayo weekend.  The first 3 min was cool.. After 10 min it became annoying cause it was so loud you could not enjoy your food.  I disliked having to fall inline at each stand depending on your meat choice.

I couldn't find the napkins either and that irritated me. We sat upstairs and waited 30 full minutes for them to get our mole fries to us. I am positive they forgot after 2 reminders even. I watched two guys get theirs with no problem. They consisted of sweet potato fries with a mole sauce, chicken, and cojita cheese. This was worth the 3 stars. The tacos were soaked in a weird sauce and the quesadilla was so plain I wanted to take it back.   The decor was cute and hip. There is a full bar. They have  patio  seating but I can pass on that.

They make the food right in front of you on a hot grill. The street corn on a stick was generously buttered and seasoned, and the burritos were as big as Chipotle's.

We decided to grab a quick lunch here to seize the opportunity.   We settled on getting tacos -   Al Pastor -  it was on the sweeter side of marinades and a bit leaner meat. That can be a pro/con depending what you are into, but I happened to enjoy it.   Cabeza - this was really good, they chopped it up well so that you get a even distribution of the meat and fatty bits.   Lengua - If you aren't sure about lengua bits, this version may be easier to swallow as it was shredded up.   The one thing I wasn't expected was it was gonna be dressed with salsa already. I mean, I suppose that's not a bad thing except I saw there were other sauces at the condiment bar that I wanted to try. Just FYI in case you are one who is spice sensitive (al pastor salsa had kick) or want to try various sauce that  everything  on it meant that.   Prices weren't bad at $2.25, but are definitely higher than street tacos as they gotta pay rent on this large space.   I enjoyed their horchata. It wasn't the usual Bang brand mix, but seems homemade! Lovely creaminess and just the right amount of spices...Yum!   I did enjoy the tacos so I would be back, but only if it's not busy.

Pros: the food is delicious!  And with plenty of options (I'm vegetarian), there's a lot of tasty options to choose from.  They'll also let you sample something if you've never tried it.  I recently moved here from the Midwest, and had never eat cactus before.  (Turns out it's yummy!)  I had two burritos, and they were very good.  Cons: the food is given in very small portions.  Usually I don't complain about this because I'm a small person, and huge portions are usually a waste (or a doggie bag).  But I also have a healthy appetite, and found that one burrito was not enough.  So, if you've never been here, be on the safe side and order two of whatever you're thinking of ordering.  The tacos are even smaller, so maybe three.  And I'm talking about a normal person who's feeling an average hunger level.  If you're starving, please go elsewhere (haha).  All that being said, it's definitely worth going to.  This is Mexican food, made by people from Mexico - i.e., the way Mexican food Should be.  It's authentic.

I will say that first off portions could be a bit more considering and comparing to competition in the same field.  We ordered takeout for the following:  Burrito for my son who ordered just carne asada and cheese on a flour tortilla.  The flavor of the carne asada is excellent has authentic carbon flavor that you look for.  Cheese was a perfect amount but the homemade flavor of the flour tortilla was lacking.  My grandmother would have criticized this tortilla lol as she would have said,  no ay no falta sabor  meaning it lacks flavor.  I agree.  My wife ordered the asada street tacos.  To be authentic street tacos, it should come with TWO tortillas, here they serve them with one.  They are good in size, packed with flavor overall good but needs that second tortilla that I am used to seeing.  I ordered the salad, while it does come in a big black bowl like serving container, it was 1/2 filled.  The gentleman who served was,  PINCHE  Spanish for tightwad with the servings.  Mine was served with pinto beans, good overall flavor.  Spanish rice, lacking way lacking in the chicken Knorr flavor that I was looking for and the serving was like 1/2 a serving at best.  Chicken, again VERY PINCHE in the serving probably got 1/8 of a cup in my salad bowl, pico de gallo and lettuce.  I would give this flavor a 4 outta five stars but in portion compared to the $8 ticket price 1.5 stars at best.  Overall I probably will not come back as I can see this restaurant is trying to  SQUEEZE  every penny of profit from one customer than to make the volume of customers if they were to either do 1 of 2 things.  Lower the price and keep the portion servings OR Keep the pricing but ante up in portions.  Your competition does way better in this department.  I have to say 2 stars overall for this place.  Flavor is NOT everything if it only last 2-3 bites and your meal is gone.  So a burrito and large drink will set you back around $11-$12 so if you are on a budget, which we all are, this can set you back for $45-$50 for a family of four.  Adios, Taco y taco!!!!  Chipotle is cheaper and portions are bigger and Café Rio across the street on Easter is about the same in price but bigger in portions.

I love Mexican food and surprisingly I have never been here till last night. Well........... lucky me, I found out why...   I was craving Mexican food and my friend suggested this place. She said she liked the tacos here.   It's an upscale taco joint. 2 floors and large open spaces with lots of tables and a bar. Great for big parties.   There must have been something in the air here, because as soon as we got in line...someone in front of us was complaining about something and it held up the line about 10 minutes. The way it's set up, there's a taco counter and an everything else counter (elote, burrito, nachos, etc.) There was one guy serving at each counter. And two of them, was helping her for 10 minutes. Three other guys in the back cooking and two at the cash register. They were fully staffed but no organization or management.   There was already a line of people complaining and asking,  are you guys in line? is this the line?  Apparently, they aren't organized. Other places, they could have a line out the door and the service would still be faster than this place.   I was craving for a burrito, but I wanted to try the Al Pastor tacos. I wanted to see how it compares to other places. I got three with everything on it. About $8.  $2.25 each taco + tax. Pricey for a taco. Most places are a dollar something.   When I ordered, the guy had an attitude and was obviously pissed with the customer he just dealt with...and I was doing my best to be kind, smile and be understanding... but I got pissed when he just threw the tacos on my tray. It splattered and left a mess. W.T.F.   And up next, we had to wait in another line just to get an elote (Mexican street style corn on a stick). that took another 10 minutes. Because there was only one guy working that counter... he was on point and had great service, the only one that had great customer service.   The tacos were Bland, flavorless, lifeless... in the al pastor meat and sauce. And the pineapple doesn't taste like pineapple. The toppings didn't make it any better.  I was disappointed. So very disappointed with the food and service. I should've just went to Roberto's, Cafe Rio, or Fausto's near by. And at $2.25 a taco... it was so not worth the $8.   Before we left, we asked for a takeout box.  Turns out they are charging $1 for a takeout box. So my friend ended up getting a foil and a bag. Cashier was rude about it as well. Attitude problem.

The place is really nice and upscaled compared to original taco shops, but the customers here are different and prominently white so I didn't expect an authentic and rustic looking taco place. Plus it wouldn't fit in the neighborhood it is in. Personally I love that the place is modern but the food is authentic. It's clean and a great place to go eat. Prices are a tiny bit higher than in the north but that was expected. Thankful that I can go 10 minutes down the street instead of half an hour across town.

The decor was nice.  The staff greets you when you walk in and the staff behind the counters were also very friendly.   There were separate aisles or stations if you may call it that where you order your food.  We had the vampiro al pastor which was pretty much pork with all the toppings, sandwiched between two crunchy corn tortillas.   My wife described the taste of the pork as if eating sweet bbq sparerib meat.  I can go with that.    We also had standard tacos, filled wither either chicken or steak.  While okay on its own, their amazing toppings bar brought the tacos up a few notches.   Imagine Roberto's but with 3 x more stuff.  So many types of hot sauces, grilled onions, beans, etc.   I really liked their options here.  Their carne asada fries were a bit underwhelming and a bit over priced.  That was probably the only miss about this place.  To top it all off, we ordered one of their elotes.  It was seasoned in chili powder, butter, and cheese.  Loved it.

Also, black and pinto beans are available hot at the bar area gratis. No worries about remembering to order a  side . I topped off my taco trifecta with a side of the house guacamole which had the perfect blend of shallots, avocado, tomato, lime and cumin that my tongue looks for.

During popular times there is a DJ in here and they really go for a hip/party type atmosphere (full bar too - with Corona on tap... which seemed rare to me, but maybe I don't frequent enough Mexican joints)... which for me means I try to grab a spot in the other corner, because I'm just trying to get my taco on, not jam out.

The ordering process is a little bit confusing if you aren't familiar, but the staff was super friendly and when I tried to order at the wrong window, the gentleman sent me to the right place.  I ordered an Al Pastor burrito for a coworker.  I thought $8.25 was a bit pricey, but she said that it was REALLY good, so I suppose it was worth it.  Everything is made to order - when building my burrito, the young lady asked if I preferred black beans or pintos, white rice or Spanish rice, etc.  It's like a truly authentic version of Chipotle, and with much better food.  For myself I ordered the chips and guacamole.  What a steal for $3.25 - they gave you a big thing of chips and I may have to say that this was he best guacamole I've ever had.  It was seriously so delicious! I shared with some coworkers who immediately wanted more.  The chips were also homemade (as they should be), and really awesome.  The cashier was very friendly and when I mentioned that the order was to-go, she gave me lids so I could take salsa with me.

There are different stations for different things like one station is just for al pastor tacos and there is another station for carne asada or chicken tacos and another station for burritos/nachos/bowls etc. Also there is usually only one guy running the burrito/nacho/bowl station so the line can get a little backed up as they prepare everything to order.

Now I wouldn't normally mind waiting but the tacos I got from a different station were getting cold. I was tempted to eat them in line.

At first, it was confusing, they have stations, then one of the beautiful girls came over and gave us a tour and told us how it all worked. The cooks were offering samples so that definitely helped us decide what to have. We finally decided on the chorizo, carne, al pastor taco, and street style corn on the cob. I must say, if that is what they eat in Mexico, I'm moving to Mexico!! The chorizo was so damn delicious, I had to get up and get a second round. The salsa bar was an awesome touch along with the bar, they've got a decent selection of draft and bottled beer.   Taco y Taco, although sit down style, is a an upgrade from their first location but certainly a wonderful addition to the Silverado Ranch area.

I made it a mission to come here with my toddler and a mission it was. This place is pretty big on seatings (lots of tables and chairs), I believe there might have been an upstairs as well,  but i am not sure ( didnt have time to explore) I did see someone coming downstair with their child, so I am not sure if it was an employee. This place is pretty loud and i am not sure what mind of music was playing (not a good place to have conversations). But it had a pretty fast beat to it.  At times I felt like I wanted to throw my taco on the floor and just dance (should be called Club Taco y Taco). But at $2.25 each, I decided it be best to just devour it instead. Now upond arrival, I was a bit confused. I didnt inderstand the concept of ordering, they have three different lines set up at the taco side, you pretty much wait in each line, depending on your choice of meat to order your taco. So yeah, that was a bummer we had to wait in two lines and wait an again at the bar to order our nachos. So if this place is packed, you will be waiting for a good amount of time. Now on to the meats, I ordered carne asada and carnitas. I basically was not impressed, I ve had better street tacos at hole in the wall places. But at least the tomatillo salsa was able to redeemed it in the  flavor catergory.  Overall the only thing I was impressed with was the homemade tortillas, (the kind abuela made with masa) i could literally eat these tortillas all day.  So if you dont mind waiting then this place might be for you, if your okay with bland meat then this is your place.

I was flying blind and dependent on the talents of the cook who I discovered needs a lesson from my old establishment.  Also, everyone who works there is busy feeding their own mouths.  Waiting for the eggs to arrive, all I saw were people chewing and holding plates under their faces while in their workstations.  My guess is, this restaurant had been an upscale eatery that didn't work out and the taco owner moved in for a song just to keep up appearances for the mall it's located in.

I frequent the original location on Tropicana, but this was my first visit to the new place. While the food is still 5 stars, management really needs to step it up on service and organization.   I saw the advertisement on facebook about the buy 2 tacos get 1 free for Cinco de Mayo for both the 4th and 5th. The advertisement said for the Eastern location only so I thought it would be a perfect time to check out the new digs. When the girl at the register told me the price, I thought it was a little high and asked if she applied the deal. She informed me that the deal was only for the Tropicana location! I told her that's not what the ad said, and I guess a lot of people came in under the same assumption, but she was still not willing to apply the discount. As soon as I got home I checked out facebook again, and they recently posted a new ad listing the Tropicana location, and deleted the old one (clearly trying to cover their tracks). But those tricksters forgot to delete the twitter one that still said Eastern. Good try, but I caught you! Overall, things just aren't running as smoothly at this location as the original, but it's still early so I'll give them some time to work out the kinks.  But like I said, management really needs to get things in order.   Despite my frustration, I can't deny the tacos. Between the 2 locations, I've tried the al pastor, lengua, tripas, carnitas and asada. The al pastor is definitely my favorite, followed by the carnitas and lengua. The asada is just ok, and the tripas was good but they didn't make it extra crispy as I requested.   I'll be back, but I'll probably stick to the Tropicana location for a few more months and give the new place some more time to hopefully get things running more smoothly.", "Date": "2014-05-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Robert", "ReviewID": "sPC49A7AiMBhp8yS0VZDYw", "Overall": "3", "Content": "A demotion to 3 stars for mere lack of good service and the overall way the place is set up.

It was a Tuesday afternoon around 2:30 pm when we walked in. We had never been before and a lady immediately addressed us and asked if she could be of assistance. She explained how everything worked and then we got into our designated lines to order.  We waited for 5 minutes before I asked her if anyone would be taking my order. She looked at me and told me the gentleman (who was on a phone call) would be able to help me when he was done. I was a bit confused because her and 2 other people were standing around. He then got of the phone call 5 minutes later and apologized about the wait.  I wasn't sure if I wanted a chicken or carne bowl so he allowed me to try the meat. I decided to go with the Carne bowl. Lettuce, white cilantro rice, bell peppers and onion, pico de gallo and pinto beans.  My boyfriend got a Carne burrito. They were going to charge us $1.25 for a small container of guacamole but I think the gentleman just let it slide due to us having to wait.  We then went up to the second floor to eat. This was nice, however I would recommend placing a drink machine with utensils and maybe a small salsa bar up there as well. (we had to walk down to get refills and needed utensils)  We then bit into out food... That has to be the worst carne I have ever eaten in my entire life! It was so extremely salty that it made the whole meal unenjoyable. My boyfriend said the same for his burrito.  I literally got a headache from how salty the food was about 2 hours later after leaving.  the 2 meals plus a drink were around $19.00 but honestly not worth it.

Unlike some places these vegetarian or vegan options only consist or tofu, well thank your lucky stars people....we have finally found a place that serves us real tacos without tofu as the only option!!! There are 4 options actually, one that's a mushroom and grilled onion blend that I tried and loved...it doesn't come topped with cilantro and onions so I added it but, you can add the topping you prefer. Also a grilled veggie, which I also had which is topped with cilantro, onion, Pico, and guacamole, it's absolutely fantastic as well. They had two other options as well but, I don't remember off hand, that I didn't try and will save untill next time. The only reason I dropped a star in this area was because, though my tacos were fantastic and the person making was knowledgeable and helpful. I had no idea what was going on when I first arrived. I literally was waiting in the same line with my husband looking at the three menus trying to compare to see if I just ask them to make mine with those options. I was clueless as to what I was to do at first. The guy behind the meat counter not helping my husband offered me no help what so ever.

Over 10 minutes later they brought THE SAME box of fries back and this is what the waitress told us...  I'm sorry, but my manager said this is how are fries are made and they will be the same if we remake them.

Three stars and that's only because it was quick and cheap but unmemorable. Walking in, the place was clean, semi-busy, no long lines at the cashier. Actually, there weren't any designated lines anywhere. So if it's your first time, look forward to finding your way around or asking a fellow customer how to maneuver around the restaurant.   After we found out who to ask for food, we grabbed a tray and placed our order. Ordered a quesadilla, tacos and corn on the cob. Quesadilla was loaded with cheese, cut up and placed one on top of the other so I had to eat it with a fork and knife because they were too heavy and soggy to lift. Overall food lacked flavor and was unmemorable.

So tiny and delicious. And that is definitely the case at this taco shop meets bar meets restaurant.   I've been here a few times now and each time I have a new item that wins me over. To really put the staff to the test, I recently visited on National Taco Day ($1 tacos!?!). The staff seemed prepared for the rush and were their usual efficient and friendly selves.  The tacos are so tasty and even though to get a true variety you need to wait in a couple lines, the wait isn't too bad for any one item. The tacos al pastor are sweet with an addictive kick, my favorite by far. Ingredients taste fresh and if tacos aren't your thing you can pick the meat or veggie of your dreams and throw it in a burrito, quesadilla, on nachos...the possibilities are almost endless.   Keep any eye out for specials not on the menu, usually on a tiny sign on the counter. Once advertised were the Mole Fries...my life will never be the same. Sweet potato fries, meat of your choice (get the chicken), mole sauce and cheese. I warned you....  They have a full bar but I usually can't resist the horchata. 4 stars only because I always find it to be HOT in there. I know there's good food cooking but crank up the AC a bit for us guests.

Taco y taco gives me that option to avoid driving down to the east side but taste and price is at a compromise.   There is a paper disclaimer in the small walkway to the restaurant warning people that this place is open to foodies with an open mind and some of the options they have will make people turn around. Honestly though... those options are worth the risk.   Interior: BIG, so big that there is a second floor to eat tacos. Some days they have a dj spinning edm sort of music otherwise it's popular mexican songs. Clean for the most part and they have someone rounding all the tables to wipe up.  Food: Your standard taco joint options with the addition of burritos, and street corn. I always go for the al pastor (spicy pork on a pineapple spit) or the lengua (tongue) always tender with no foul odor. The street corn is just like the ones you'd get from the carts, cheesy with mayo and a slight kick from the tajin. Their burritos are a hit or miss, miss in the sense that the white rice will be mushy and ruin the burrito. Otherwise it's on point and make sure you ask for the cotijas (mexican parmesan cheese) it goes great.  Price: a bit higher than your regular mexican restaurant but not by much.

Once you get your food and sit down, holding a conversation with others is nearly impossible.  They play techno and dance music at a volume where it makes it difficult to understand those with you.

Totally looks like a bar or lounge rather than a taco restaurant.   By far, I've tried two different meats for the tacos. The al pastor and tripas. I also tried both on flour and corn tortilla. I'm more of a flour tortilla person so my preference still lies there. Between the two meats, the tripas is probably my favorite. I like the al pastor but honestly think it's a little overrated. I also asked for everything BUT pineapples both times I went but somehow still ended up with pineapples on top. Meh. The tripas was amazing. If you get it, ask them to deep fry it a little. It comes out so crunchy and adds way more texture (since tripe has such a weird bite to begin with).   I also had the mexican style corn. Yum yum yum! They make it right in front of you so you could ask for extra stuff if ya want. I like mine super cheesy! My friends also got the mole fries and al pastor fries. I wasn't a fan of the mole fries. The sauce was already sweet... drenched over sweet potato fries made it a bit too much. The al pastor fries were decent as well. Fries were chunky but a little soggy - probably because it was drenched in meat and other sauces. They were good but I probably would never order them for myself.

The salsa bar is easily the most impressive I've ever seen...fresh made salsas, fresh cut veggies, grilled veggies still steaming, and boiling beans. The homemade horchata was unbelievable. Service was a little slow, which is fine considering that they basically build your meal from scratch.

There's even a party of about 20 celebrating something. It would be cool to sit near the railing to look down on the chaos.   Yes its chaotic here. The inside is as huge as the outside lets off. There are about 4 separate lines for things I have never heard of. I had to ask a couple of regulars what was what so I knew where to stand. It looked like one line but I guess one line was just real popular.  This is where I deduct a star. It could be better managed. Maybe have a greeter direct newbies or good signage but definitely a better system of ordering. I was waiting along the salsa bar the whole time I waited and inevitability was in someone's way haha. The lines or the salsa bar need to be rearranged. I suggest it be put against a wall but I couldn't tell you where.  It definitely looks like mass confusion.  When it came time for me to get my salsa there was someone in line in MY way lol. For anybody that cares it's colder upstairs then it is downstairs and they carry liquor.   They have Barbacoa but not just that. There's like 3 or 4 types of beef I've never heard of lol. There's also like 3 or so types of pork.  I guess I'm saying you'll have meat options.  The place definitely gives off a factory vibe where they are pushing out tons of product. I do have to say they are efficient with the food.  The food is definitely good and the salsa bar is also good but both aren't excellent and could be improved.  My wife thought the Carnitas were flavorless but the Barbacoa had plenty of spice.

Another employee seemed to be helping them more than her, so I kept waiting. After a few more minutes she turned around and said hey. I replied with a very irritated sounding hey, she rang me up with the attitude of me inconveniencing her. At this point I felt as though no one deserved a tip because of the wait, and her rudeness. So when I signed their copy of the receipt I drew a line through the tip area. When I handed it back to her she showed it to another employee, to which he replied  pendejo . Now I don't speak Spanish, but I know enough to know what that meant  when I looked at her she had a snotty smile on her face, so I took my food and walked away.

Like many others have said, this restaurant is set up like a fancy Tacos el Gordo. Except the patrons and ambiance are a lot more wannabe hipster and lot less Mexican.   The food is good. Flavorful, if a little bit on the saucy / soggy side. The Mexican street corn is really delicious and they really don't skimp on the meat and cheese on the carne asada fries.   My main dislike is how freaking loud it is in here. During happy hour they have a live DJ, which is fine because it's like,  whoo party tiiime,  but even during regular hours they BLAST the club music. It is unnecessary for the music to be so loud, and it distracts from the food and conversation.   My second dislike is sort of related to the set up. I understand they're trying to do it like tacos el gordo with separate meat stations, and that works only if they move FAST and at similar speeds. However, the burrito / fish & shrimp taco / fries, nachos & corn station is significantly slower than the meat stations. That means that if you want carne asada fries AND an al pastor taco, even if you order the fries first, go order the al pastor taco, and come back for the fries, by the time the fries come out your taco is cold. Even if you order carne asada fries and a shrimp taco (same station), they come out so far apart from each other that one is inevitably cold and soggy by the time the other comes out. So the only way to have all hot items is to order only meat items and no sides.  Update: They are obsessed with the vampiro right now. My friend ordered an al pastor taco, out came a vampiro.

Today was the 3rd time in a week I have came here for Elotes,not a very hard menu item at all to have available throughout the day. The first time I came at around 7pm and was told they've been out for awhile. This EXCUSE was just that an excuse. To cook whole corn takes. It a few minutes and is an extremely simple task that even the most novice cook can do. The second time was just the next day at around Noon and then I was told that they hadn't prepared the corn yet and it would be awhile before it was ready and that I could go to another of their locations. This was both rude and horrible customer service at the same time. The third time was just a matter of minutes ago. This morning I went in at 10:16 pm. I thought to myself that they possibly may not have it ready since they only opened at 10am,but I obviously was wrong in assuming that this establishment was staffed by proper chefs/cooks/or managers who were skilled and knowledgeable in food prep and having the entire menu ready before the establishment opens. Instead of being told this morning that they were out I was instead told  The night shift didn't leave us any prepared corn  so am I correct in assuming that if cooked food weather it be corn in this case or let's say meat of some sort of not used the day before is re-used again the next day?.

The tacos were delicious, but I'm an atmosphere and experience person and those just did not deliver for me.   Food: I got the Gran Tacos with no meat. Vegetarian options here are great (soyrizo, sautéed mushrooms), but I wasn't feeling super adventurous at the time. The salsa was my favorite. Not too spicy, but super flavorful. I also had black beans, cheese, and guacamole on mine, and they really were excellent. They melt the cheese right on the tortilla, and then you can get more on top. My friend got the Mexican street style corn on the cob, which was amazing. Definitely will go back for that alone.  Atmosphere: I feel like the layout is all wrong, almost backwards or something. They explain to you the different lines that are available for different items that you order, but the area isn't big enough and the lines sort of all run together, and I witnessed multiple people think they were being cut in line, and wonder what the hell was going on. Not to mention the burrito/bowl/fries line runs the other way, right into the street taco line.. Not laid out very well at all. The topping bar is also kind of in the way of these lines. Not sure how that will work during a big lunch rush...  If customers can get past the clusterfuck of a layout, taco y taco will be successful.

Between the line backup (there's not enough space for separate meat counters!) and the music being too loud for employees to hear my order (a live mariachi in a cavernous space?!), there is a disconnect between the concept and the actual facilitation of business.

Upon walking in my husband and I thought... oh they did a nice job with the remodel inside ...until we sat down and really got a chance to look around.  We sat facing the stairs (right in front of what appeared to be their booths) so this enabled us to see the upstairs.  The curtain appeared to have fallen off.  The front area looked odd...was it a place where people can eat or is it a sort of lobby/waiting area?  Maybe If the place was packed with people it wouldn't look so empty?  The bar area only seats about 4 people...and we thought it was suppose to be somewhat of a bar/restaurant?  The ambience just didn't fit well with the type of food they serve.   Now the kitchen...they did a great job with the remodel of the kitchen as the restaurant before did not have all that kitchen equipment.  It started to make more sense to us once we saw the kitchen...as a lot of money went into getting all that equipment so I'm sure the owners just wanted to open the doors to start recouping some of that money.    Now the food...we were disappointed as it just didn't taste like their other location.  We love the Al Pastor tacos; however, their Al Pastor seemed to be heavily spiced with cinnamon that it over powered even their salsa that they put right on top.  We also had their Barbacoa tacos and the meat was on the chewy side rather than what we're used to with the meat just falling apart easily.  We overheard a lot of new customers confused at where they are suppose to order.  Now I read the other reviews from other yelpers and you'd think they would put up some directions by now as to not upset new customers...but they haven't.

I was happy that I no longer have to go to north town to find the old lady pushing the grocery basket - that was a win! I also got the cilantro white rice as a side which was bland & not tasty. I ended up throwing it away. My husband had gone straight to the fourth line to get a burrito bowl with al pastor (which was awesome and hand carved which gave it a nice touch). The guy serving the fourth line was personable and cracking jokes - which helped break up the stress from the ordering process.   Check out was easy and they have a huge self-service salsa bar which was well-maintained. Prices are decent...$2.25 per taco and $3 for the elote. They do have a taco happy hour as well.

A friend and I headed here last Saturday after a long training ride, ready to get our taco on.      Just after opening at 11:00am, we walked in to find a spacious restaurant complete with bright lighting, high ceilings, a bar, and staff that greeted us heartily; this used to be the Republic Kitchen & Bar restaurant, so it may be the nicest taco place I've visited. I was quite surprised to see a DJ mixing tunes at that time of day, but not a bad thing. There were a couple of other customers already eating and the place got progressively busier during our visit.       Set up like the other location, there are stations where you can order tacos, burritos, quesadillas, bowls, elote (corn on the cob), fries, nachos, mulas, and vampiros.      Meat choices: al pastor, asada, pollo, tripas, carnitas, cesos, cabeza, lengua, trompa, suadero, buche, and chorizo.  Vegetarians have an option of soy chorizo and panela (pasteurized cheese).   There's a salsa bar with lots of options for you to add to your order.     I had two al pastor tacos with pineapple, a carnitas vampiro (two crispy tortillas with the meat and cheese inside), and Mexican street corn on the cob (elote) with the works (mayo, cheese, and chili powder)--I was hungry one minute and then full the next.  My friend had never been to Taco y Taco before and he gobbled up his food before I finished.       This Taco y Taco gets five stars from me for the location, the tasty food, and the service; I'll definitely be here a lot.  BTW, for those fellow Yeeps who've been missing Tia Shirley B. while she's been off Yelp, she's been here almost every day since they opened so you may see her when you visit!

I have to show some restraint every time I come here. On multiple occasions I've put away double digit tacos. If you're able, coming here at non peak times is your best bet, because it can get crowded in the parking lot and in the restaurant lines. Having some taco eating partners to stand in separate lines and order will also make life a little easier for you.  If you'd like to get away from the standard chicken and carne asada (which is still good also), this is the place to do it. There are so many different types of meat that are sliced fresh and put onto your corn tortilla and topped with mainly onion, cilantro, and guacamole. With the pineapple, the al pastor is great and not found in every taco shop. I also like the lengua, cabeza, chorizo, and adobada. If you need a little crunch, you can sandwich the meat and cheese between two tortillas to make a vampiro.  The salsa station and the bar is what sets Taco Y Taco apart from the others. There are so many side items and salsa and you're sure to find a combination that works for you. You name it, spicy, mild, radishes, beans, pickled carrots, cucumbers, etc. And what goes best with your tacos? How about a Modelo or a margarita? There's plenty of room in the restaurant including tables upstairs once you get your food.  Each taco will set you back two dollars and change. They also have a pretty decent happy hour.

There was a bit of a line on a Wednesday afternoon. Clearly, a lot of businesses come here to grab a quick bite to eat. Now, I have heard about this place from other people. I've seen the beautiful pictures of elote (corn smothered in butter, cheese and spices). But sadly, the food did not taste as good as it looked in the photos.   FOOD: We had the chorizo taco, carne asada taco and elote. The chorizo taco was extremely salty, so I do not recommend this for anyone. The carne asada was dry, did not taste fresh at all. Even adding some sauces to the mix did not make the tacos tastier. The elote was okay. They smothered it in butter mix, sprinkled some cheese on it and chili powder. There was something missing in the elote, For sure it was the best thing in my meal, but I would not come back to try again.   PRICE: I felt like it was overpriced for the quality of food I got. For two people, it came out to $25. I should've driven farther to enjoy El Gordo's instead or even Roberto's.   SERVICE: Service was okay. The people were nice and they gave me what I ordered within a timely manner.   I give this place a 2-star.

This place has ruined me for every other taco spot I've frequented in Vegas, LA or Boston. First off, the tacos are served on hand made tortillas - not the tortillas out of the bag like at other places. The carne asada is cooked in thin steaks on the grill, allowed to get just a little bit of that char flavor, then chopped up fresh for your tacos. Served with guacamole! The al pastor is still spinning on a spit with a pineapple chunk on top. Served with a hot salsa, and bits of pineapple. The chicharron is served both crispy and soaked in chile verde - I recommend getting both kinds in your taco. The lengua is chopped fresh for your taco, and cooked perfectly. It seriously puts to shame the lengua tacos I've had anywhere else.   Also, this place gives you the types of options you'd see at Chipotle, but with more authentic flavors and ingredients. You can get your burritos, bowls, quesadillas, even nachos and mole fries! They even have the street-style elotes (corn on the cob). AND Happy Hour specials on tacos and beer!

All in all, Taco Y Taco is an extremely authentic gem along the S Eastern foodie corridor, and is also available in a less-hipster wrapper along E Tropicana , you choose!", "Date": "2016-02-21", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Chad", "ReviewID": "Nfa2UMwaCwYRfnJ_K_35ug", "Overall": "5", "Content": "We had just arrived in LV following an early morning flight and were happy to see Taco Y Taco was open at 10:30 AM. As others have mentioned the ordering system is certainly unique but once you  get it  it's rather straightforward. The counter staff's friendly explanation helped as well. Our order consisted of two burritos (carne asada for me and pollo for my wife, both with the guacamole add-on), chips, and a fountain pop. The burritos were fantastic and well-built; delicious and tender meat, tasty guac, and just the right proportions of ingredients. The chips were also very enjoyable as they were light and crisp without any residual oil. We tried the mild red, tomatillo, hot habanero, and avocado salsas from the self-serve salsa bar, and all of them were tasty with the mild red and avocado being our favorites. Altogether it was a fantastic, fulfilling meal in a friendly and cool atmosphere for less than $26.", "Date": "2016-11-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Brenna", "ReviewID": "mTIsQPNqKWZ1iSWI3VrMgA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "These tacos are phenomenal oh my god!!!!!

It gets confusing when there's a long line for line 1, and you want to order from line 3, but you don't want to cut anybody and make them (h)angry.  Particularly this past Friday night June 12th, 2015, it was hot and smelly inside. The AC wasn't on, and it reeked of garbage and wet dog in the area next to the staircase. It was seriously uncomfortable eating inside, and I regret choosing not to just eat at home.  I ate 2 al pastor tacos (which I usually get) and the al pastor was not juicy like I had remembered. It was overcooked and not flavorful. It's just difficult because I used to be obsessed with their al pastor, and that night I was utterly disappointed (I take my food seriously, especially when I come to LOVE it haha).  Maybe I just came at a bad night. I give them 2 stars instead of 1 because I remember how they used to be. I'm sad that I was actually disappointed with my experience that night.", "Date": "2015-06-15", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Deli", "ReviewID": "rg7swAVzlD5fznyyrKQjjg", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Food:  4 Eastern's Taco Y Taco is the exact opposite of Tropicana'sTaco Y Taco and not in a very good way.  Although they serve the exact same food and the same price, Eastern's serving/portion sizes are substantially less than Tropicana's.  The staff here are less friendlier too.  Snotty is a more appropriate characterization.  Customer service sucks worse than an inoperable vacuum cleaner.  I've been here twice and my second visit was worse than the first time.  Although Eastern is way closer to me than Tropicana's, I'd rather drive to Tropicana's to really enjoy all that is best from Taco Y Taco.  Suffice to say, the 2 star is for the staff and the customer service.  This Taco y Taco spot took over what was once Republiq that took over another establishment whose name I don't remember.  All the previous occupants were short termers and didnt last, and  Eastern Taco Y Taco is deemed/doomed to follow the same fate!", "Date": "2015-09-27", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Tony", "ReviewID": "3nuKzWroL3BTJ4IaOOPQ9A", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Environment: Clean, fun, and lively.

Well I gave the original location a 5 star cause I loved it so Im gonna give this location an extra star cause I love it even more. Yes an extra star, 6 stars, so what its a 5 star rating system. When they decide to open one near me I'll probably give them another star too LOL. It's the same awesome food as the original location, maybe a few more options on the menu, but in a larger, fancier, and better place.  There's lots of meat choices. If you're having trouble selecting which meat you want just ask they'll gladly explain or let you sample, free food sample them all haha. A must is Al Pastor with everything on it and extra pineapple. Al Pastor is a spicy marinated pork that's been roasting on a spit, take it like how they serve it or let them know how you like it, I like a little more crunchy then normal. There's 12 different meats :) I've had them all at the other location but one that I didn't see  was the cochinita pibil so I had to sample it, delicious I need to have it again. The meats can be put in a taco, burrito, bowl, fries, nachos, and as a vampiro then you can go to their condiments area and load up on their various sauces and sides. Warning the sauces aren't labeled but if its like the original location there's a habanero sauce in the mix its probably orange, try them all and buy a drink. Ask for fried green onions and peppers if there aren't any at the condiment area.  There's a vegetarian menu also which you can put in a taco, burrito, bowl, or the other options like the meats. There's the Seta which is a mushroom and chile pasilla mix with queso fresco, the Soyrizo which is a soy chorizo, the Queso Fresco which is a smooth pasteurized cheese, and the Vegetables which is fajita mixed style with green and yellow bell peppers and purple onions. Reading of the menu.  I got the Al Pastor, Lengua (tongue), and Carnintas (shoulder) tacos and even an Al Pastor fries with everything on all of it. Everything was very delicious as I remembered from the original location.   There's a lot of dining room both downstairs and upstairs, it seems more private upstairs and with a view of downstairs. They serve cocktails and beers. Happy Hour is 6pm-8pm daily, Brunch 11am-3pm Sat and Sun, Live Mariachi 6pm-7pm Mon, and DJ Fri-Sun. I don't know what the deals or menus are but noticed them on a flyer on my way out.  OK I'll comply to the 5 stars rating system for now.

Lack of organization, dirty tables and trash was wanting to come out of the trash container. Bartenders were pretty slow.

We came in to have a late lunch (2pm) and it was confusing at first to figure out how to order.   There is separate stations to order different type of foods (al pastor station, taco station, etc). Then you eventually end up at the end to pay at the cashier. We ordered Al pastor and chicharones tacos, with mole fries.   The food was good but since we were waiting to go through each station, by the time we paid our food was warm instead of hot. The food was delicious and the ingredients were fresh except we wished the chicharones was crispier. I'm assuming since we came in late the crispiness was gone over all.  There is seating everywhere. I'm not sure if this place has always been Taco Y Taco, but there is 2nd story seating.", "Date": "2014-05-24", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
