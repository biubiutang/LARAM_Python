And the past few times my breakfast has been horrible. Today my biscuits and gravy we're ice cold, hash browns old as if they we're sitting all morning. Took forever to order, and then took extra long to get my order. On top of that didn't get a receipt. To add to that service took so long I missed the bus.... might as well just go to McDonald's if service is this horrible. At least there food is hot.......", "Date": "2015-06-17", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Lori", "ReviewID": "VpT_U5PJsNNI8nkMTPBbvQ", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Let me make this short but sweet.  We waiting for our food ( which was to go ) for 45 minutes. Granted, while we were waiting the manager gave us two free large drinks and added fries to our order for no cost. This helped with the frustration we were experiencing considering this is supposed to be 'fast food.'  But then IT happened. i watched a cockroach walk his happy little safe all over the floor where people were waiting and then into the KITCHEN! i was appalled.  Once we got our food our money was then given back to us since we had to wait for so long but i will never be going back. My experience here kind of made me question these fast food restaurants. :\", "Date": "2011-08-18", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Robert", "ReviewID": "mrmin7eHnjdc3lD7ea_WZA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Whoever gave this place 2 stars is lame in my eyes.

I've gone maybe 5 times in the last month and a half during various times, so I've got a pretty good handle on it.   Usually, I come here and get the turkey burger with criss-cut fries and a drink. It is not a difficult order as I don't ask for any modifications -- just the burger and fries an drink and a side of ranch. Word. having said that, I don't think I've ever gotten a messed up order here. That's awesome bc it sucks when you get home and you're missing the cheese or something. Fail.   The service, however, is hit-or-miss here. A few times I've gone and gotten really crappy service, just like I've got and gotten really awesome service. I have yet to figure out how/why/when and all that, but there it is.   The food here is the same fast-food, Carl's quality you already know: better than McDonald's, sure, but that's like saying you're the skinniest kid at fat camp. I do like the turkey burgers, though, which is why I come here. (Although, I got regular burgers the last time and they were ok, too).", "Date": "2012-08-23", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Aaron", "ReviewID": "dWlxKSRwmIjiE_ULQ7kCKg", "Overall": "1", "Content": "This location is horrible and I won't be going back.
