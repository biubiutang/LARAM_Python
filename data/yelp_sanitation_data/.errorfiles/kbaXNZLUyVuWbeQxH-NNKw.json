And it's OOOOH SOOOOOO GOOOOOD!    Bell's BBQ on Eastern, near Sunridge Heights intersection.    We tried Bell's and were quite impressed. We both had the Pulled Pork, reallllly good~ nicely prepared, fully cooked juicy & tender. Could have been hotter, temperature wise for my tastes, however my husband didn't seem to mind. We both ate all of it so it obviously was fine.    Typical BBQ SELECTIONS, ribs, pork belly, brisket & Chicken & they also have a kids menu ~ and nice dessert options if you have any room left to indulge in banana pudding, creme brûlée, Jordon's Cheesecake and more just can't  remember them all.     Lots of sides to choose from, smashed potatoes (YUMMO!) , corn on the cob (nice! not over cooked with a smidgen of butter, 2 different types of cold slaw, pickled & Caesar style (hubs had the pickled & quite enjoyed it) southern prepared greens (again my Hubs ate these & thought they were Gr8!) The sides we didn't try, smashed yams, Okra fries, 3 cheese Mac n' Cheese I am sure I have left something out but as you can see Lots to choose from~    Nice interior with booths & tables to accommodate 70 guests, nice strings of lights draped from the ceiling all add to a pleasant dining environment. All the servers genuinely friendly greeting us upon entering AND exiting       Currently just open for dinner, have take out ordering, catering will offer lunch after they complete their soft opening. Everything went like clockwork for our visit, so if your in the mood 4 BBQ, stop by Bell's & prepare to carb load!!", "Date": "2015-08-22", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "8a6-8tRVEh3IrJixThzejQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Much better this evening,  brisket was awesome greens were a little cold but overall good job", "Date": "2015-11-03", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Racquel", "ReviewID": "7gJRdH_dKvu5Xtcr9YLLfw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "We had such a great experience here!

Let me first state I am no BBQ aficionado but I do enjoy great food.  Bells has a very diverse BBQ menu and 3 different BBQ sauces that are all amazing. Very big variety of sides which out of the 5 my wife and I had were all fantastic. The pulled chicken and brisket were both cooked to perfection. Not sure if it was a special but the Buffalo cauliflower nuggets were spectacular.  Price point I feel was spot on. Portions are large enough for 2 sittings. Large variety of craft beers and desserts that sounded amazing. I intend on going back just for dessert tomorrow. Just ran out of room for it.  If you enjoy BBQ give Bells a shot.

This is my second time to Bell's Bbq. The first time we dined in, and the second was takeout.   I'm not a gnaw the meat off the bone type of girl, so I opted for the pulled chicken both time. Flaky, tender, and extra spicy with their choice of regular or hot bbq sauce. Aside from the meat, I am a major sides girl. They have so many to choose from and are always adding new ones. So far the cheese corn, baked beans (with pieces of brisket), deviled egg potato salad, garlic mash, and cheese grits have been my default favs. They offer two with your meat order, but you can add on as many as you want for a reasonable $1.75. Also, house made pickles and Texas toast (think Raising Canes) come with your meal.  This place is great for kids. Im all about not paying an arm and a leg for my two kids to eat out. I get them both a side order of the 3 cheese Mac and they are stuffed. Super cheap, super yum.   The restaurant itself is clean and cute.  Nothing over the top, but I kind of like that. A Mom and Pop kind of place. The staff is super helpful, and they are on top of coming over to fill your cup at the self serve drink station. A+ service.

Was completely blown away by the food.  Everything was fantastic.  To top it off, they opted to wait on us due to the size of the group.  The pulled pork was perfect, moist and full of flavor.  The brisket was really tasty and begged for their homemade BBQ sauce as the perfect compliment.  A side of pork belly was an overindulgence, but it was fantastic and almost started a fight as people were trying to steal pieces!  Any BBQ fan knows the staple sides, but Bell's takes it up a notch and goes gourmet on them.  We didn't try quite everything, but each one we had was phenomenal.  Mashed yams could easily be desert.  Potato salad with the just right amount of egg.  Crispy brussel sprouts were a huge favorite.  Beans were rich and flavorful cooked with the brisket.  Buffalo cauliflower was a surprising treat, and the okra fries were delicious.    No one ordered a dessert jar, but I'm sure we will the next time.    Do yourself a favor and check out Bell's.  Without question the best BBQ in the area.  Don't believe the hype about the cost - the price point is fantastic for the massive amount of food you get.

The pulled pork was stuffed between a thick slice of Texas toast perfectly grilled on each side. Brisket was still juicy and was melt in your mouth texture. Mac n cheese was also good, served with some crackers baked into it. I got to try some of my wife's St Louis ribs.

Excellent taste and spicy level was perfect.   I also really liked the Caesar slaw. Genius! The boyfriend ordered a side of the pork and said it was good. A happy boyfriend makes my life easier. The mashed potatoes were a little boring for my taste... but a little spicy bbq sauce fixed them right up.   The service was very friendly and helpful. Kudos to smiling staff - it really makes a place standout. I can't wait to try more options from the side menu and maybe check out a dessert jar.

So, to put the visit in a nutshell and cap the food: their meats are good. My brisket wasn't as hot as I'd have preferred in when served, but it happens. Their sauces are delicious, so I was happy.  What I was VERY disappointed in was their fried okra. The okra was mushy. Fried okra is not supposed to be super mushy. Sorry. Not good. I think part of it is the way they cut it like french fries rather than in rounds like most places do (including how my grandma used to make fried okra.)  Bell's leaves a little bit to be desired, but if you're in the area and have a hankering for some bbq, I wouldn't count this place out by any means.   Would I come back here? Probably.

We rolled in around 1130am for lunch, and after perusing the menu for a bit we were notified that the brisket and 1/2 chickens were not ready. They don't offer a 3 meat sampler plate, but you can order a base plate and then 4 oz add ons on the side. So this concept is a bit different from other BBQ places.   I ordered the daily special, a BBQ rib sandwich, a side St. Louis Rib, and the BBQ beans as my side. My friend went with the catfish sandwich, which he enjoyed. They have regular BBQ sauce and a spicy one, which I didn't try. The regular sauce was sweet and tangy but not overpowering. My BBQ rib sandwich was delicious, topped with coleslaw on texas toast, and I managed to get 1/2 way thru before filling up. The BBQ beans are not for me, with the onion and pepper combined with brisket.   Where I felt it wasn't a great deal was the 1 St. Louis Rib add on for $2.95. This rib was not full of meat, but a bit thin so I felt like a bit overpriced. The flavor was good, the meat tender, but not really smoky....and I didn't see a smoke ring. I don't know where they keep their smoker. Next time I'll drive around back to see if its there.  Overall, good food at an ok price point for the area. Service was great, very friendly.

Unfortunately the food was a big let down. First off, it was over $16 for the brisket meal which came with two sides and one piece of texas toast. Just way over priced for one person. I really wanted to try the banana pudding in the jar but that would have brought it over $20 just for a bbq plate.   The brisket was served on the toast which I didn't get. If I wanted it on bread I would have ordered a sandwich. The first few pieces of brisket were extremely dry and tough which made it hard to chew. The 3 cheese mac n cheese lacked any  3 cheese  flavor, it was just a bland sauce. I did like the BBQ beans however, great flavor with pieces of brisket.   I also liked how it was decorated inside, but if the food dissappoints, Im forced to give 2 stars as I have had much better BBQ. I am definately willing to give Bell's another try as I really want to try the banana pudding jar.

The food looked good enough, but digging in was not as pleasurable as we wanted it to be. My brisket was dry and cold, and smothered in their sauce.

Pulled Chicken Sandwich- The chicken is served folded in Texas Toast style of bread... the bread/toast was good... and the serving size of the whole thing was really big. They definitely didn't skimp on the chicken. Unfortunately the chicken was sooooooo dry. I used a couple of their sauces to liven it up a little.  Brisket- Very dry. But luckily they have great sauces which again helped to liven it up.  Pork Belly- My partner absolutely loved it.... and that's a big deal! Flavor was all there, no dryness!  4 Cheese Crusted Corn Coblet  (side)- This is an absolute must! Very rich and yummy... not messy, comes on a stick, easy to eat.  Okra Fries (side)- Delicious! We were a little skeptical as their appearance is kinda blehhh. Paired with their homemade ranch was a home run. You don't even need the ranch.  3 Cheese Mac (side)- Disappointed. It was more like a very bland cheese pasta off the kids menu in an Italian restaurant. The kids scarfed it down. I guess I was expecting some awesome mac n cheese you would usually get at any BBQ Joint. I wouldn't get it again.  Sweet Jars!!- We ordered the  Aunt Linda's Red Velvet . Wow! We were fighting over bites. So moist, the perfect ending. Served in a cute mason jar. This will cure any sweet tooth cravings. Even if you don't want BBQ or anything to eat... stop by and get you or someone else a Sweet Jar! We are going back this weekend to try some other ones.  Sauces- Their BBQ sauce is an absolute win!

I came back here a second time to just make sure that the food was good and I would give it a solid 3.5 star.  1. Pork Baby Back Ribs - These are the very best and every rib we had was very tender and moist. Smoked and just right every time!  2. Sliced Brisket - I had asked several times if it was really moist and tender and they said yes.  It was tasty just not the most moist ever brisket.  If you douse it with enough sauce, in the end your won't notice.    3. Chicken - The bbq chicken was pretty good. They give you the thigh, wing and a quarter of chicken. It was overall good, however, I don't think you should ever give up the breast part as it is too dry overall.  4.  The sides - We had the red bean and rice, the southern greens and the fries. All were your standard fare, pretty decent overall.  5.  The service - Nice service, you order and then they bring to your table. They are friendly and helpful!  6.  They serve the food in a nice metal tray with Texas Toast on the bottom, the meat on top and the sides.  Price wise, I find it on the slight higher end, although I enjoyed it overall.

I have tried John Mulls meats, Famous Daves, Rollin Smoke, Lucilles, and a few other places I have forgotten. All of those places have let me down in one way or another (sauce overpowering, too expensive, too bland, etc).  Bells is the Belle of the Ball. I had the Pork Belly plate with a Brisket add-on, with Smashed Potatoes and the 3-cheese Mac and Cheese for my sides, and Sweet Tea to drink.  The Pork Belly was so tender and juicy. It was the second best belly I have. Only second best because the best was a little less fatty and had more of a smoked bacony flavor.  The Brisket was also fantastic. Tender and fall apart on your fork.  The Smashed Potatoes are flavored with Smoked Garlic but it's just a hint. Not over powering at all. And they are real potatoes. Like my mom used to make. Definitely not powdered or flake.  The 3 Cheese Mac and Cheese is great. You really can't go wrong on a 3 cheese mac.  The sweet tea was good, definitely not overly sweet.

Overall, this spot is A-OK and I would return.  The restaurant is clean and open with about a dozen tables. A few of the tables are large enough for a group. There are a few picnic tables outside too. The location is easy to find on Eastern and there is plenty of parking in front of the building.  The menu here is one of the largest menus I've seen at a BBQ restaurant. They offer all of the meats you'd expect from a BBQ joint, around 20 side options, and other items like catfish. They definitely weren't lacking in options.   The service was a five during our visit. As soon as we arrived the woman at the register asked if we were first timers and gave us an overview of the menu. After we ordered at the counter she brought our food to the table and then took care of everything from there. We were offered drink refills and to go boxes when the time came. They definitely have service in order.  I'll start with the sides because these were my favorite foods. The Pickle Sticks were my favorite side. The sticks were thin, lightly breaded, and delicious. The sauce on the side wasn't even necessary. The 4 Cheese Crusted Corn Coblet was unique and delicious. The Deviled Egg Potato Salad had great flavor and texture. The Red Beans and Rice were good, but could have used more Cajun spice.   My husband had the Pulled BBQ Rib Sandwich. It was much larger than it looked in photos on Yelp! Overall, the sandwich was good, but the meat was not the most tender meat. My two meats were St. Louis Style Ribs and Chopped Brisket. The meats were okay, but neither were as tender or as seasoned as I expected.  For dessert we shared the Black Bottom Key Lime Pie jar dessert. Choosing a dessert was hard because they have so many great options. The key lime was tart and the chocolate crust was yummy.   I'll return because this BBQ spot has a lot of potential.

She was so helpful and informative and I let her order her suggestions for me, telling her I was open-minded. The half-chicken was perfection with juicy meat and I could not eat it all. One huge beef rib was so tasty, I just wish there were more meat on this particular one, as I like beef better than chicken or pork, but that is the way it is with beef ribs. I had the zucchini medley like a salad-type zingy tasty treat, charred collard greens? which were delicious and I dipped them in bbq sauce. There was Frank's bbq sauce-type fried spicy cauliflower and a thick piece of bread. My favorites were the key-lime pie and the cheesecake desserts. They were each served in real glass mason jars.

Don't get me wrong, this method is completely acceptable and is far more sanitary and efficient.  Now, having said that, this really is some good roasted meat.

Help us keep this business in the Anthem neighborhood by supporting them and call in your orders for take out too.  We personally took several menus to hand out to our neighbors.  On comment as some though the prices a little high.   This is not a fast food joint and try buying this meat at the grocery store, marinating it, and preparing as they do for the price.

Have to try them yet but glad I know where I can get them.  I also can't wait to try the grits and cheese.  Yum!  The staff is friendly and helpful and aim to please.  The owner came by and I did tell him the greens were not spicy enough for me and that I liked the vinegar from a bottle of tobacco peppers on my greens and he said he would look into getting some.   As far as price, well, a good BBQ place buys good meat and they have to cook it just right so they have to have someone who knows what they are doing. Someone that feels that these prices are high, has not eaten in many good barbeque places.  Typically, it ain't cheap!   I am not totally sold but I will say that I will be returning.

My first clue should have been that they didn't have HOT LINKS on the menu.  What kind of BBQ place doesn't have hot links?   I ordered brisket.  I was absolutely flabbergasted when the man carving the meat CUT THE BARK OFF the brisket and threw it in the trash!  They claim to  hickory smoke  the meat for 14 hours.  There was absolutely NO SMOKE RING on the meat.  How could this be?  Last, the brisket was 100% lean - not a speck of fat anywhere.  Since fat means flavor, dry and boring is the BEST thing I can say about it.  There was little to no smoke flavor.   While bbq is never cheap, their prices were a little high.  They don't have any 2 or 3 meat combo meals.  If one wanted to try more than a single meat, the option was to purchase a full order of another protein on the side.  It was nearly $60 for myself and my 83 year old Uncle.  We both had two meats, he had a dessert, no drinks. The guys working there were super friendly, even guiding me to their door, over the phone.  (A bit hidden in the shopping center). The girl at the front counter wasn't rude or anything, just not as friendly as the guys.

I liked how they cut the Texas toast into a pita like envelope.  The meat is then stuffed into the bread.  Clever! It was good but not memorable.  I had a taste of my husband pulled pork sandwich and had the same thought.  I wish the meat had more of a smokey flavor like other BBQ places.  The cheese grits, however, were so delicious! I loved every bite and could just eat the grits as my meal.   The caesar slaw was also just ok in my book.  I probably wouldn't order those again.    From all of the Yelp pictures we had to try the caramelized banana pudding.  It's served in a cute little mason jar.

We hit up Bell's BBQ while we were in Vegas earlier this month (July 2016).  Tip:  A Yelp check-in gets you a free side!  The BBQ is awesome...moist and tender.  I split a brisket plate with 3 sides (one free) with my daughter, so we would have room for the 3 dessert jars we ordered.  Priorities...always save room for dessert.  Our dessert jars were:  Red Velvet, S'mores and Crème Brulee.  All were wonderful.  The Red Velvet was my fav.

On the opposite spectrum, the mashed yams were a sweet balance, and very delicious. The brisket was good, a little on the dry side, but nice flavor. The barbecue sauce was great.  On the other hand, the cornbread waffle needs some improvement. It tasted more like batter, and not even like a waffle, let alone, a cornbread waffle.  The concept is great, if it were Real corn bread batter, cooked in a waffle. But it is not. And the sweet tea was good. But could have been a little sweeter.

Now I am giving this 5 stars for multiple reasons though there were a few recommendations.  I will start out with the things I didn't so much love nor dislike but did think need improvement, minor yet notable.  First, was my husband ordered a side of pork. The young man at the register asked if he would like that chopped and my husband said,   yes . His only recommendation on all the meat was to chop it a little more like more traditional bbq so its easier for consumers to eat.  Second, were the okra fries. I absolutely love okra so to see okra on the menu I was ecstatic. These left me a tad disappointed. The end was still intact, the breading was falling off, they lacked any flavor, and had to be my least favorite thing I ate while dining.   Now for all the AMAZING THINGS!!!! I am vegetarian and my husband is full on carnivore so the menu here was perfect for both of us giving multiple options. I ordered the Mac and cheese which was heavily!!!! I have to say it probably was the best Mac and cheese I ever had anywhere so major props! I also ordered the sweet potatoes which were divine and not to sweet like other places. The grilled cheese was made with real cheddar on Texas toast and not greasy. My husband ordered a pork bbq sandwich which was huge, the meat was tender and moist.

It's called Bell's BBQ, and it's right here in Henderson.  --What's On the Menu-- Brisket, Pork Belly!! Pulled Pork,BBQ Chicken, St. Louis style ribs are a couple of the featured menu items. The menu is well rounded with combo meals with your choice TWO sides, Texas toast and pickles made in-house.   The variety of sides you can choose from include 3 cheese mac,braised southern greens, Okra  fries ), Smashed Yams w/brown butter & vanilla bean. The corn coblet is described as either plain or Parmesan-Asiago herb crusted! Bet you know what I'm getting next time! There are more listed on menu plus Chef John Bell mentioned they will be adding more in the next few weeks!  WOW!  There's also sandwiches. Someone order this and take a photo and post on Yelp please!! I saw a pulled pork sandwich being brought out to a table. The presentation of it is Yelp worthy! And for under  $10 with your choice of side is pretty sweet deal! The BBQ rubbed pan roasted catfish w/bbq tartar sauce sounds divine too!    --Super Family Friendly!-- The kids menu has mini corn dogs(toddlers love these!), grilled cheese, and smaller sized portion of the larger meals. For under seven bucks it also includes choice of side and a soda. (wonders how old you have to be to qualify as a kid to order ...hmmm)   --What's On My Plate-- I got the Pulled Pork meal and chose smashed yams and okra fries on this visit. Also ordered an add-on of brisket. The pulled pork came on top of the Texas Toast.  Both bbq meats are smokin hot! Perfect mix of meat & fat on pulled pork.. so juicy!  Flavorful & melt in your mouth. Yass!!! And the smashed yams with vanilla bean was insanely good! So were the okra fries..it's sliced and dipped in a corn meal batter I believe. Delicious!!! You'll be happy choosing those sides as I was. The side portions are pretty generous servings. The meats are very good quality,good portion size too and the price is right!    I also got St. Louis ribs for take-out for Mr. B. Dont miss out on these meaty and tender ribs!!!   Oh wait!! There's dessert!! In jars!  S'Mores, Caramelized Banana Pudding, Cheesecake with berries and Chantilly creme? A touch of gourmet twist on these Southern treats. Yasss! Save room for it! I got the S'Mores one. With brownies, marshmallow creme, chocolate mousse, PANNA COTTA, topped with chocolate ganache and krispies. Good stuff. No need to travel elsewhere for dessert.   --Ambiance/Location--  Fast casual style restaurant.  Order and pay upfront at the counter, seat yourself, and servers will bring food out to you. There's also take out too! My orders came out in timely manner.  Everyone on staff was friendly and helpful. Chef John was nice enough to answer my dumb questions. Really nice family friendly place.  Spacious, clean and mix of seating in dining area in way of booths with high back chairs and also dining tables that seats 4, but can easily combine tables for larger groups. You have upbeat country music playing in the background.  Location- Anthem/Green Valley part of Henderson. Bell's is visible facing Eastern Ave, just past Horizon Ridge, in the strip mall next to Pho Mailan. Or locals like me know the shortcut access entrance area off Sundridge (where Lee's Liquors is) and drive around the back.  Soft opening as of this visit with limited hours for now. Open for dinner at 4pm.  So check before you come. Back of take out menu and server told me extended hours coming soon!  --SUMMARY--  Go! NOW! Before this place gets super busy! Because it will!

Their tiny dining room was jammed with hungry folks who were only getting hungrier from the intoxicating smells. But the peeps behind the counter were cool, calm, collected, and very professional. They apologized when food took long (which they advised guests of prior to ordering at the counter), and we're kind and patient. Hard to do when you're as weeded as they looked, but they pulled it off.   The food: again, a solid 4.  -My favorite was the pulled chicken. Tender. Not dry. Just enough chew. Smokey, although not really pulled as much as chunked. Atop Texas toast with seasoned salt. Yum.  -The smashed yams were fantastic.  -The St. Louis. ribs were good. A tad bit over cooked. Not very succulent and juicy like I like em, but great flavor.  -The chopped brisket was very peppery, again great smoke flavor, and not too fatty.  -Coleslaw was average. Not enough dressing in my opinion, but we ate it all.  -Crispy onion straws were good, but we're probably better fresh out of the fryer like most fried foods.  -The sauces were superb. Original. Spicy. BBQ ranch. Honey mustard. We are a saucey clan, and we liked them all.  -And the PICKLES!!! A+++!!!   Will return. Hopefully on a not as busy day, and will eat in.

Others have referred to this as a mom-and-pop place.  While it is family owned, I think  mom-and-pop  is a misnomer and implies a casual approach to food preparation.  This, on the other hand, is great food by a talented chef.  The menu is  deep,  with lots of choices.  The flavors of everything I've had were bold, not the usual bland tastes we're finding at more and more restaurants.   Everything appears to be made in-house and was very fresh.  And, until they get a better sense of how much they need when, I'm willing to put up with their being out of some items in exchange for this freshness. The details:  I've had take-out once and eaten in twice. Baby back ribs had lots of fall-off-the-bone meat.  Very flavorful and were not covered in sauce.  I consider this a sign of good meat and good preparation.  Other similar restaurants seem to be covering up their product with lots of sauce.  A vinegar-based sauce was provided in a separate container.  Catfish  add-on,  that is, a small portion, is delicious.  Plenty for lunch.  Ask for the tartar sauce - it has some extra kick in it. Cole slaw and fried onions were very good.  As with everything else, portions are very large - enough for two when ordered as an  add-on.   The  red devil  potato salad was delicious - the potatoes had good texture and the dressing unusual but sure to become a favorite.  Baked beans had great depth of flavor due to addition of peppers and plenty of brisket.  The pickles were a great surprise.  I've never had freshly brined ones - very crisp and a great counterbalance to the ribs and fish. Dessert for me was a classic crème brulee...but served in a cute little glass jar.  They have other choices. Another good feature:  the carryout containers are high quality -- no styroform.  They were thus leak and drip proof.  It looked like they had a good selection of beers.  There was also Woodbridge wine.  Other beverages were available from a soda fountain setup.  Although customers order from the front counter and then the food is brought to the table by servers, this doesn't have a sterile, takeout kind of vibe.  The lighting is nice and people seem to linger at their tables enjoying another beer.", "Date": "2015-09-27", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "C2YCpAHLRGV_o2seQG2ImQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "We had planned on going here since we accidentally drove past it one late night.

I had the brisket plate with mac n cheese and their southern greens, the wife had the pulled pork sandwich (wow) with the Brussels sprouts. There was nothing left on either plate. Even then we had to try one of the sweet jars their signature dessert. We had the cheesecake which again was excellent. They let us try a new thing they will soon have on the menu, buffalo cauliflower...yum!

The brisket wasn't their best item on the menu, but I'd keep Bell's in mind if I were on this side of town again.  Menu features the choice of a meat plate (8oz with two sides, house-made pickles, and Texas toast) or a sandwich, and you can add on additional meats (~4oz?), as they don't have multi-meat combo plates. Sides of mac and greens were just okay.  PORK BELLY: The highlight. Was surprised to see it on the menu, but it ended up being the best thing. Tender, falling apart, juicy, and full of flavor. Wish I'd just ordered this! BRISKET: Close, but no cigar. Nicely seasoned with visible smoke ring, but the meat itself was dry and hard in spots. I suspect this is because it wasn't all that fresh, being that they're new and not quite so busy yet. I'd give this another try on a future visit. PULLED PORK: No. This was the oddest meat in the meal, cut into odd pieces and drowning in sauce, portion also seemed smaller than the others. Meat was very tender but sauce was overly sweet, did not care for this at all. RIBS: Got the St. Louis style, add-on. They're large and meaty, but BF found them a bit too fatty for his liking. I'd get them again, but kind of wish they came sauced, as the cups provided for takeout make it an odd fit for dipping the bone without making a mess. Pleasantly surprised with these!  DESSERTS. I'm not big on desserts, but I couldn't resist the cute jar presentation! Opted for the cashier's favorite, the S'mores. The graham cracker crust bits were on the clumpy side, but the rich, chocolately mousse tasted just like hot chocolate and the browned marshmallow fluff on top was nicely subtle.  Service was welcoming and friendly, interior is clean and modern with country décor touches- love the strands of lights above the dining room!

I am a big fan of BBQ and it is about time we have a very decent barbecue restaurant on Eastern Ave in Henderson.   My wife and I drove by and ate there just 2 hours after they opened their doors.  Chef John has 30 years of restaurant experience and he and his wife Stephanie were friendly and welcoming.    First the positives (and there are many).   The brisket is outstanding.   Tender and juicy and filled with flavor.   Many times it is difficult for a restaurant to get brisket to not  dry out but not at Bell's.   It was perfect.  We also tried some ribs (naked,  without sauce) and LOVED the rub used.   The ribs were meaty and did not need sauce but Bell's had 2 homemade sauces available.   For sides we tried the Mac n Cheese,  the southern greens and baked beans.   Of these,  you need  to especially try the greens.   I usually don't like greens but Chef John somehow made these taste pretty awesome.   The Mac N Cheese as well as the beans were tasty but compared to the rest of dinner,  were just average compared to other BBQ joints I have been to.     The biggest positive was the desserts.   You MUST try the Smores which were served in a glass jar.   Three kinds of chocolate,  marshmallow,  graham cracker  crust with a few cocoa crispies as a topping.   Yummy.   I would (and will) go back just for this dessert.   The negatives are few and pretty minor.

The Food- My wife has the pulled pork and enjoyed it, she is not a seasoning person, so the pork was lightly smoked and seasoned, and was perfect for her. Me, it needed more seasoning.  My son had pulled pork sandwich, which was a good portion of meat and worth the $9 price.  I asked the cashier what I should go for since I didn't want ribs, and was recommended the brisket. Some of the better brisket I have had, good smoke flavor, nice char, not gristly, and not dry!   The sides were all good, although none of them really stood out.  The dessert - This was the highlight of Bells, we had the smores and caramelized banana pudding which are served in these awesome little Mason jars.

I met up with my family during my lunch break on a Wednesday afternoon and almost didn't make it back to work because I was ready for a nap. The sides weren't my favorite, but most importantly, the meats were delicious and everything was good enough overall to keep us coming back.  I ordered the brisket meal ($14.95) with the $3.95 pork belly add on and BBQ beans and okra  fries  for my side. There was a healthy portion of brisket that was a touch under seasoned as I had to go the BBQ sauce for an assist. The pork belly was excellent: crispy, fatty, and salty, another nice sized serving, well worth the extra dollars. I wasn't a big fan of either side, no problem with execution, I wasn't into the grittiness of the cornmeal on the okra and the sauce for the beans could have used a little more flavor. But no worries, they have plenty of selection for sides and I'll just get something different next time.  My wife and daughter split the baby backs ($24.95) with the 3 cheese mac and cole slaw. The leftovers were lunch for me the next day and they were quite tasty. Also ordered were a pulled chicken sandwich ($9.50) and pulled pork sandwich ($9.25) both with assorted fries. They were both finished, again no problems with the meat, except for the ends of the Texas toast. For the sandwiches, in the bread vs. meat battle, the bread wins in a landslide. I also noticed the french fries sogginess and that oil was soaking through the box container. The fries probably weren't made to order or just sold too soon and had been sitting around.  I would have loved to try a sweet jar, but I was just too full. A definite reason to come back though. A $72 lunch for a party of 5 may seem a little steep, but considering how much food we ate and how much we still took home, we got some bang for our buck. There were no issues with the service and everyone was friendly. The barbecue wasn't the best ever, but all in all we had a good first impression so we'll keep Bell's as a barbecue option for us.", "Date": "2016-07-14", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Erin", "ReviewID": "lNstkYp8TZCidd5ZIb9o9A", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Everything was amazing!  The pulled pork, pulled chicken, fried okra, Mac n cheese, fried pickles and above all the red beans and rice. My son ate everything on his plate which is impressive.

We love Stephanie and the manager with glasses. They are awesome as well as the back staff. The guy with dreads and the guy who sometimes works the register are awesome.   However, on multiple occasions we've came for lunch we've dealt with a less than stellar gal and her crap attitude. Today was even more inappropriate and completely rubbed me wrong. We had placed an order to be picked up and ate in. She told her cook we had arrived and to complete our order. There was multiple orders - it's lunch time, of course. She got openly frustrated with the cook and continued to be unprofessional and snooty to the person completing our order. When she returned to collect payment from me, the cook said  sorry you lost me  and she said  I didn't mean to lose you but seriously?  And made this face to me as if she was dealing with a complete dummy. Which she wasn't - and the cook did nothing to deserve treatment like that.   It's gotten to the point where moving forward, if she is in attendance at work we will not be coming here for lunch. It's unacceptable to behave that way especially in the front of the house and certainly in front of your patrons.", "Date": "2016-06-07", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Yogev", "ReviewID": "_ujKT5tuVxXc_sitLvOZwQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Amazing!

I'm not that picky when it comes to smoked meats, I love them all. Usually spicy BBQ sauce can cover any subpar BBQ.   Cons: Service was not friendly, did not greet us, took order and looked miserable. Asked if we wanted to add a tip, when person taking order didn't do anything to earn it. Screwed up garlic mashed with potato salad, ignored me standing at front counter until another employee pointed me out. Price was way over inflated for what we received. Save your money and go to Dickie's for better BBQ or make the drive to Rollin' Smoke or John Mull's for the best BBQ in Las Vegas. Food: Everything was bland, temperatures and textures were wrong. Brisket was spongey, didn't feel like I was eating meat. Sandwiches were extremely stingy with meat, sides: mashed potatoes, egg salad, mac & cheese, coleslaw were all bland. Not sure how that managed to mess up everything they served. Pros: restaurant is extremely clean, in a good location, presentation of food was nice.", "Date": "2015-10-17", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Marissa", "ReviewID": "1GYLZmKzyh5Ze5HqqbtFuw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "This place is about a 3.5 star restaurant.  Better than average but not necessarily warranting a 4 or 5 star rating.  Ordered the brisket and funny enough we found it to be too lean and a little bit dry.  I know others have complained that it was too fatty - we actually like a bit of fat in our meats.  Ordered a pork belly and st Louis rib add on.  Very solid food.  Nothing great but not bad either.  For me, the side dishes were the best part.  We got the baked beans and the mashed yams.  I'll probably just go back and order 1 of each of the sides!!", "Date": "2015-09-04", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jason", "ReviewID": "IrTEb7sL51bX3kGlshG-pw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Wow!
