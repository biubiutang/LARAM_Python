With the happiest hiking trails, lake, and downtown in Nevada, Boulder City is the Happiest Place in Nevada. In my eyes Boulder City is the Magic Kingdom of Nevada. Where Disney Land's mascot is a mouse, Boulder City's is a big horn sheep. This review talks about the different lands that are the components of the Magic Kingdom of Nevada that is Boulder City (abbreviated BC).  Main Street USA     BC features a central business district that was built with the principles of town planning. It features two Main Streets: Nevada Way & Arizona Street. When the founders built the town in the 30's, it was designed so residents would not want to leave to drink & gamble. In similar fashion to good town planning, there is abundant greenery. If you picture Washington D.C.; Boulder City Square & Wilbur Square are the Mall. The Bureau of Reclamation Building, sitting on a hill would be the Capitol. There is so much to see & do. This includes Coffee Cup, Boulder Bowl, antique shops, Boulder Theater, & the Historic Boulder Dam Hotel. Events are held throughout the year.  Adventure Land    BC is a land of adventure. Bootleg Canyon is world known for the highly acclaimed bike trails. From high above Bootleg Canyon, a popular adventure is ziplining down Red Mountain. For the hard core adventurists, Gold Strike Canyon is a place to play Indiana Jones while you climb ropes and slide down death slides on the way to the Colorado River. My favorite adventure is to hike up Red & Black Mountain to see awesome views of Vegas, Lake Mead, & Boulder City. Lake Mead National Recreation Area offers infinite adventures. Boulder City Stone Circle offers adventures for astronomers. In 2005 Pluto was observed from this spot. And If your a golfer, the three golf courses offer adventures in golf.   Frontier Land    What a dam frontier BC is. In the 30's it was the hub for building Hoover Dam. With the electricity generation Hoover Dam accelerated the settlement of the southwest. The Historic Southern Nevada Railroad played a major role. Today people could ride in a Historic Nevada Railroad train on weekends in addition to experiencing the Southern Nevada Railroad Museum. Recently when the Memorial Bridge opened, it expanded the Las Vegas frontier into northern Arizona. There is discussion of major developments being built along US 93. At a higher elevation from Hoover Dam, the Frontier Land landmark would be Red & Black Mountain. Instead of a railroad, it is a hiking trail.  Fantasy Land     When I drive US 93 into BC, I am on the Journey to Imagination. BC is a place where fantasy comes true. It is a Fantasy Land where the dream of walking through 5 tunnels to one of the Wonders of the World comes true. It is a Fantasy Land where the pixie dust of the Hoover Dam created an inland sea known as Lake Mead.  On this sea recreationists could ride in water craft or enjoy a boat tour. It is a Fantasy Land where the dream of sharing a picnic with big horn sheep comes true. And it is a fantasy land where people could share solitary moments in a valley with teddy bear cholla. At night I have lived my fantasies of walking on a dark River Mountains Loop Trail under the stars without the fear of getting jumped. It is a fantasy come true that brings me to Boulder City for night walks.  Tomorrow Land    BC is the city of tomorrow. It is a city designed with progressive zoning. The City Code of BC limits development to 120 single or multi-family residential permits per year. Voter approval is mandatory for the approval of city land an acre or more. It is a Tomorrow Land where power centers and sprawl are not in the horizon. BC is a Tomorrow Land that will include the Bypass of the Future I-11. It is a Tomorrow Land where people will be closer to nature than to space. At 202.7 square miles, BC has sufficient room to grow.  Fast Pass to Bypass Line of Traffic    In BC, people line up in cars. US 93 is known for its traffic headache. To bypass the gridlock on US 93 and Buchanan Boulevard, Lake Mead and Hoover Dam bound motorists use the fast pass to bypass a line of traffic. Here it is: At the first traffic signal on US 93 at the end of the freeway; turn right on Veterans Memorial Drive. At the traffic signal, turn left on Adams Blvd. At the 4-way stop, turn left on Buchanan Blvd. This ought to bypass the gridlock.  Admission   Boulder City is a public city. Admission is free. However if you drive a few miles above the speed limit, there will be a steep admission to enter the Magic Kingdom of Nevada.  **Review 76 of The Daniel S.

I grew up in a small town.  I guess one never really does get that out of their system.  It's a place that knows exactly what it is, and uses that as a means to be the best it can be.  There's no Wal-Mart looming in the distance.  Or Starbucks.  Or even a casino in town.  And outside of a few fast food places and convenience stores, it's all  Mom 'N' Pop  retail.    There's an excellent wine bar that serves food, a good Mexican food place, a few bars, breweries, and bed and breakfasts, a little theatre run by Desi Arnaz Jr., a bowling alley, and a few antique and clothing shops.  It's all very clean  Americana  feeling.  They change their statues on their main street every few months to keep things fresh, and there's a feeling of pride in the whole area.    It's right next to Lake Mead, and the Hoover Dam.  A few casinos are on the outskirts of town, but not in town, they have a number of events and festivals, and a film festival throughout the year.  There's even a ren faire outside of Vegas' main one.  At night, it's incredibly quiet and well lit.  It feels perfectly safe walking around, and the houses don't look  cookie cutter .  I know it's kind of weird coming from someone who lives in Vegas to want to find something that is so directly opposite, but sometimes, you need a little mental break away from the lights and the traffic and the casino lifestyle.  The best part is, when you're ready to return, it's only a short drive away.  I've been using Boulder City as an  escape  for a few years now.  Its friendly people and quiet charm ensure that I keep returning.", "Date": "2011-07-24", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Margret", "ReviewID": "Y2aIBoBABWy2ULn1YkPxjQ", "Overall": "3", "Content": "This small town is what you drive through to get to the Lake Mead recreational area and Hoover Dam (there's no going around it). The few stores and restaurants that you see is pretty much it (yes, on the main strip). The main street/strip is  dated but it gives it that much more character (the stores look like old-west-ish). It also looks like a movie set, almost surreal. I remember eating at the diner several times here.  The chain stores/restaurants we saw recently (monday) were: Von's, Pizza Hut, Panda Express, and Taco Bell. I could be forgetting a few others. I noticed four ethnic restaurants (mexican and chinese) that were not chains. I heard (some years ago) that some residents do their shopping in Henderson, at the Galleria Mall and the surrounding area.    I am from a large city so this small town is not for me (I can't even imagine living here). Everyone knows everyone and knows all their business, too. That is fine, if you are used to it.   I will say that some of the homes in the  historic area  have nicely manicured lawns and the semi-custom homes are beautiful, too. Years ago, the most famous resident was Desi Arnez Jr. And Calamity Jayne (a local celebrity who kinda reminds me of Betsey Johnson) had a small boutique store here, too. I also saw a road runner many years ago ( beep-beep , but never mind the vibrant rich cartoon image, because the real road runners are a dull brown color). And finally, there is a very nice vista point before actually going to the lake or the dam (stop, park, and take some pictures).   There is an annual Barbeque Cook-Off and a parade (but I can't remember for which holiday/event).", "Date": "2011-10-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Nelson", "ReviewID": "8zZ5dNqYkMHKmaCrtuc5Wg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(284/365)  Beautiful Boulder City   Always a great place to get away when you're in the mood for a small town setting without the hustle and bustle of the strip.  Lots of antique shops to check out if you're into collecting retro/vintage things from the past...a few historical buildings and interesting art pieces along the streets are worth a peek.  Food Options aren't bad...Coffee Cup, Grandma Daisy's, Milo's, The Dillinger, Boulder Dam Brewing Company, Colorado River Coffee Roasters, and Chilly Jilly'z are some of the locals' favorite places...  During the first weekend of October, Art In The Park is a great weekend filled with arts, crafts, and food that you need to check out at least once. If you love animals/nature, during the warmer summer months, Hemenway Park is the place to be to catch a rare glimpse of Nevada's Bighorn Sheep up close, and Lake Mead is very close by.  Take the drive, get away from the strip every once in a while...You'll be glad you did! ALOHA!!!

I've been all over the place, with my day camp, growing up, and Boulder City is the most magical. From going to the lake with my family, to the Art in the Park, to visiting my grandma up by the water tower, when I heard we were going I was ready. As I got older, I found myself just going to sit in the park, with my dog Sweet Pea, for hours. I ate at the original Coffee Cup, and I am happy to see there expansion. I've seen many different shops, a few restaurants, and have even hung out in the underground bar. It was sad to see the Antique Mall go, however, I see many small business relocate and a handful of new ones now open. There is more to do! We recently attended the Best Dam BBQ and enjoyed it, very much. Just a pretty little town with the most relaxing, serene, beautiful atmosphere. The view of the lake, at the look out, is breath taking and pretty much worth the drive, alone.

There's a main street called Nevada Way with several restaurants, souvenir places, and antique stores.  A walk on Nevada Way is a fine way to spend some time looking at the many pieces of public art.  These sculptures, some are for sale, heighten the beauty and charm of this city.  There is history if you do the walking tour of the city.  Stop at the museum at the Boulder City Hotel and you can see why the town is laid out the way it is.  Find some of the original 5 Companies housing.  It's an enjoyable city.  PS:  Guy, there's a Starbuck's in BC.

It's not a city by any stretch, but a town.  But Boulder Town sounds ridiculous and like something straight out of a Mad Max movie.  BC is comprised of many different people who live in many different dwellings.  From let over housing from the Dam building days, the proverbial trailer park to million dollar mansions it's got a little of them all.  I have spent a lot of time there in the past couple of years that it does not feel  touristy  to me anymore.  Come out and enjoy the parks.  Xeric landscaping does not really exist in the community. The city and many neighborhoods are still very green and well manicured.  Have fun exploring the main drag on Nevada Highway.  There are many shops and restaurants to choose from.  BC also has one of the premiere mountain biking spots found in Bootleg Canyon in all the world or so I am told.  My one recommendation is to watch out for the mass exodus of travelers that use the town as an egress route when returning back through Arizona.  The traffic can be quit heinous.  My suggestion is to by-pass all that and make the right turn on Veteran's Memorial Drive.  Follow it to Adams and make a left.  When you hit Buchanan hang another left.  But there are those rare times when not even this can help you as traffic can back up to Rail Road Pass.  During the week BC is much less chaotic.  While sitting down in a diner and staring out the window I am reminded of home and for a brief second forget that I live in the Mojave desert.  BC is a special place and I understand why those that a fortunate to live there do.", "Date": "2011-07-25", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "John", "ReviewID": "BWFDz-0iIE0YXJpoXCjYEg", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Cute town nestled away behind Vegas.

There's also a pocketful of shops and diners to keep you occupied.
