Perfect for a very hot day with my go to drink which is their sweetened Iced Green Tea, easy ice. That way, I won't finish my drink in 4-5 sips. Half off drinks from 2-5 is a very cool deal!  Food wise, when a craving hits, I like their foot long Coney Dog and their sweet onion rings. The service has always been pleasant, and other locations around town make it very convenient to cool off when the Vegas heat gets to you.  ALOHA!!!

There is one just down the street from here on Boulder, but this one never has a crowd, is consistently good with their drinks, and has a friendly staff. We go here almost daily for a Route 44 during the hot summer months. They sometimes close early at night, but around sunset is the perfect time to come to catch a nice view of the Strip.", "Date": "2011-06-20", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Vanessa", "ReviewID": "UJKqEk0jHwuZc330VHVOng", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Even though this sonic is the closet one to my house, I would prefer to make the trip to another one.

Usually we really like the boneless wings, but this time they were small, dry, and tasted old.  My mother called to complain, and after spending $34 on this visit, they offer $4 off and a free drink...gee thanks.  This particular Sonic is not going to get my business again.  I took a photo of the nasty small wings and posted those on Yelp as well, take a look.", "Date": "2015-12-05", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Allison", "ReviewID": "toPveZ3221Y9_VAYBp3FRQ", "Overall": "2", "Content": "I stopped at this Sonic because I was out doing errands and need something for my low blood sugar. I had not eaten lunch (being a diabetic that is a big no, no) so I thought I'd get something to eat and a drink because it was happy hour. YAY for half priced drinks! I've also been trying to stick to the Atkins diet so I was debating between a double cheese burger and the grilled chicken sandwich. I picked the grilled chicken. When I got it home, the piece of chicken was very tiny. It didn't even make it to the edge of the bun. I only used half of the bun and disposed of the rest. I just feel for $4.39 I should get a little bigger piece of chicken. I've had this sandwich from other locations before and I know it was not that tiny! What happened?  My drink was tasty and they even got the diet cherry in it correctly! I used the drive-thru and the service was great. They were very friendly and quick.   Normally I love Sonic and their food, but this time I was severely disappointed! I could have just gone to Wendy's or Jack in the Box and gotten the same sandwich for the same price or cheaper and it would have been a lot bigger. Check your portions Sonic!", "Date": "2014-01-23", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Desiree", "ReviewID": "Xu862b3MuGCRPcXnJzWhUw", "Overall": "3", "Content": "My boyfriend and I stopped here on our way to a work call in Lake Las Vegas. We were trying to rush an go on with our day off so possibly could have been more irritable than normal however the service didn't help our moods.  The woman working the drive thru was rude and impatient taking our order. She had the worst attitude and I could tell through a box! That's what prompted me to write this and it only got worse! At the window she charged our card not saying a word and handed us our items one at a time. There were very long gaps of time in between each beverage and the food. Every time she walked away she left the window open so we could hear them complaining (very loudly and animated) about having to cook the breakfast burrito at one pm....and jalape√±o poppers. It was awkward, to say the least, when a new equally as rude employee returned with our food.", "Date": "2013-12-02", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Michelle", "ReviewID": "ho6f3t8FayYctlwabVIRYw", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Edit: Several months later I needed ice and didn't want to get out of the car so I took a chance. I was greeted kindly so I've started going back. I'm not sure what caused the turn over but the employees are nice again however I've yet to order sweet tea   I'm just not even coming here anymore. I'm not sure sure what happened to this place. The very polite employees seem to have all been replaced with rude ones. I don't want a red carpet but I don't want them screaming in my ear they can't hear me or becoming upset if we misunderstand each other and need to fix an order. I've continued to come thinking it would get better but if anything it's gotten worse. As a side note, if you don't have sweet tea don't tell me you do then dump sugar into cold tea thinking it's the same because it isn't and it's obvious as soon as I take a drink. Very disappointing because it was once a really decent place.", "Date": "2016-06-25", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Kim", "ReviewID": "ypoZLxlKHB_B-qYyXYl6ew", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I just have to review on this place because my husband and I practically live here. I mean with half price drinks and slushes for happy hour and half priced shakes after 8pm, who wouldn't want to hit this place up. Their food is always cooked fresh and is delicious.

I recent found out that you can get a delicious drink from half off during their happy hours from 2-5pm.  This particular Sonic is located off Lake Mead Pkwy just a hop, skip and a jump from the entrance to Lake Mead National Recreation Area.  When in need of a high calorie, high sugar liquid cup of goodness ( I love the Ocean Water) after a hard day of playing or exploring the lake area, give this location a go.

I went last night to get a chocolate malt and there was no line in the Drive Thur ,but they made me wait to take my order anyways. This happens here all the time for some reason? Not a big deal but, my real compliant is the malt. It was so runny and watery I couldn't drink it. It was so gross! The same person made me my malt 3 days ago and it was great. I don't get it. And this is like the 3rd time this has happened to me here. This Sonic is so close for me. I hope this can be fixed or I will have to switch to the Boulder Hwy location.

Rarely is it for food, it's the slushies, shakes and blasts that keep me coming back.   Currently Sonics has two promotions I like to take advantage of: drinks and slushies are half off from 2 pm to 5pm, and shakes are half off after 8 pm.  When I do get food here, I stick with the basics: Sonic burger and tots. To me, these burgers are a couple steps above what you'd get at McDonalds, but not quite as good as one from In&Out/Fatburger/5 Guys.    There is another Sonic nearby (on Boulder Highway) that is just as close to home as this one, however the friendly service at this location is what keeps me coming back.", "Date": "2015-08-04", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ron", "ReviewID": "VFk3w4SmmqMBgNChw8isyg", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Ordered and some boneless wings.

I always feel like I'm having a screaming war with the person through the intercom. I hate it!   Is it terrible I only tip them if they're wearing skates(which btw it's RARE here)??
