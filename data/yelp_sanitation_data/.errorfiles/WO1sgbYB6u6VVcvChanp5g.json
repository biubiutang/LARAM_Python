Perhaps never again at all.  The first visit was great. The service was okay and the food was delicious. We ordered daechang (large intestine) and traditional kalbi. The daechang was a treat due to its rarity, especially here in Vegas. It's slightly marinated, which is a nice touch and adds a slight sweetness to its rich, fatty flavor. We liked it so much that we returned four more times.  This is where the bad begins. The second visit was mostly okay but the daechang wasn't marinated properly and lacked flavor. If the dish wasn't prepared properly, the servers should have told us that it wasn't available. We could have ordered something else. Instead, they served it to us anyway. After they us served our food, we were forgotten and the food ended up getting a bit burnt. It was still edible and the place was fairly busy so we gave them a pass.   The third visit on, things get really bad. The servers burn our food AGAIN. We waited over 15 minutes for more rice, side dishes, and water. That's only after having to flag one down after being ignored for quite some time. This is at 11 PM, when less than 4 tables are being served and 4 servers are working. We had to ask for straws three times. Twice to our server who never procured them and a third time to someone who wasn't even serving our table who *eventually* brought them to us. We were annoyed, but just chalked it up to tired workers who had a long day.  The fourth and fifth visits just sucked. Why did we go two more times after a shaky third visit? Probably due to a combination of having too much faith in mankind and a hankering for marinated daechang that can't be found elsewhere in town. By now, the faith is gone and the craving for that sweet, fatty dish has all but withered up.   So long, DJK.", "Date": "2015-06-04", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Mu", "ReviewID": "9j-nrudbU9K_TirL-xZNcg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Suggested by one of my friends who lives in Las Vegas.

I wish I could give it 0 stars.  My mother, sister and I were visiting Las Vegas for a few days (we are Korean btw so you can count on us to know what good Korean food is supposed to taste like).  We decided to come here for a late bite at around 11:30pm on a Friday night.  When we walked in, the entire restaurant was COMPLETELY empty with no background music playing, making the place look sad and desolate.  The fact that it was completely deserted on a Friday night definitely irked us..  We got seated by a woman that seemed like she was either the manager or owner.  She seemed pretty off-putting and did not put any effort with welcoming us in, especially when we were the only customers in the entire place.  When we tried to order our food, she told us that a lot of the basic menu items we wanted (all buckwheat noodle  nengmyun  dishes, all smaller beers, etc) were unavailable after 11pm, giving the excuse that they have to turn a specific set of their cookers off which are used for the nengmyun noodles.. To me, this is pure laziness.  Because of this, we decided to get a bibimbap order for each of us.  She gave us waters, which tasted like terrible tap water.. At first I thought it was really weak Korean barley water, but then realized that they were serving us tap water that just tasted (and smelled)  disgusting.  We didn't even touch the water, which is sad seeing that it's pretty hard to mess up WATER.  Then they brought out our side dishes (banchan), which tasted either old or poorly cooked.  The kimchi was not even edible-- it tasted very old and sour, and had that 'carbonated' taste which only happens when old kimchi sits too long in the fridge..  The bean sprouts (kongnamul) was undercooked and also inedible.  The blanched spinach side dish also tasted old and was too soggy, as if it was leftover from the entire day at the restaurant.  All the other banchan was mediocre to say the least.  None of it tasted fresh, and was so bad that it even made me lose my appetite a bit.  Finally, our main bibimbap dishes came out, along with a small side of anchovy soup for each of us.  My mom and sister ordered the stone-pot bibimbap while I ordered the regular one.  The white rice that came in their dishes were overcooked and soggy, which made their entire bibimbap dish inside of the stone pot too  wet  and mushy... The bibimbap themselves were pretty mediocre too, and I doubt that any of the veggies in them were fresh, just like the banchan they gave us. The anchovy soup was also cold by the time it reached out table, which we barely touched.  In the end, we couldn't finish any of our bibimbap food because of how un-appetizing and tasteless everything else was.  The red pepper paste (kochujjang) that we used in our dishes was more flavorful than the actual veggies and meat in the bibimbap itself...  I couldn't finish most of my bibimbap, so I decided to get the rest of it to-go in an effort to maybe cook it into something tastier.  When I asked for a to-go box, the lady looked at me and my food, then condescendingly says in Korean  if you take it to-go, the food and rice will get bloated and it won't taste good..   Um, excuse me but I didn't ask for your two-cents.  The lady gave us the check and only one small to-go container, so I asked if she could get us another one.  She looked at me as if I made an impossible request, then comes back with another container and a bag, in which she dropped and left on my seat.  After we left the restaurant, we couldn't stop talking about how terrible the food there was.  Yes, it was really that bad.  Maybe their food and BBQ is better during the day, but if that is the case then they really shouldn't have the business open 24/7 if the food can't be consistent!  TL;DR-- You don't go to Vegas to seek amazing Korean food per se, but even so this restaurant doesn't come close to making it on that map.  Very disappointing place and none of their food tasted fresh or even decent.  One of the worst Korean places I've been to in a very long time.  Terrible customer service.  Very unfortunate that many items on their food+alcohol menu is unavailable after a certain time at night, seeing that they are open 24/7.

We ordered the Jack combo (brisket, pork rib, beef short rib, beef, and we substituted the beef tendon for chicken). The meat was tough, the selection is poor, and nothing was marinated.

A wide range of tastes and it's nothing particularly heavy, greasy, or guilty that I'll feel bad about in a few hours.    But I digress - DJK is located off Spring Mountain and is, as mentioned, open 24 hours.  They offer a fairly decent Tofu Soup with slightly sad collection of banchan late night -always the same, generic, not particularly fresh - coupled with my bibimbap and the late-night percentage discount, it's a fairly nice place to hit for a cheap price.  However, their table BBQ is very expensive - it's a pre-set package that starts around $50-$60 bucks that you essentially need to have several people there to help foot the price.  To me, I don't mind paying for that at Honey Pig, but the quality at DJK is not quite fantastic enough for me to justify the price.

They liked the Kalbi, but the soup was.... peculiar. It has ice in it! Like they were not joking when they said it would be cold. It was like a soupy slush, lol. There was cucumber, ginger, and jicama in it, as well as some type of meatloaf slices. The soup was sour. I wouldn't say the soup was bad, it was just strange. I guess we're just a family partial to warm soup.  My brother got the Dolsot Bibimbap, which looked outstanding.   I ordered the Galbitang. Oh my goodness. Their Galbitang is wonderful, and I highly recommend you order it if you ever visit this place. If there is ever a rainy day when you might feel gloomy or if you feel a bit under the weather and just need a warm and cozy pick-me-up, this soup will do you wonders compared to the plain ol' chicken noodle. The soup was brothy and so full of flavor. I was given a very generous portion of meat, too. The noodles were cooked well and the green onion added enough of its own flavor to really make the dish special. I added lots of black pepper to mine and also dumped my rice into the bowl, just as I usually do with this dish. Perfection.   I would like to comment on their Pan Chan (sp? The little side dishes each table is given to enjoy with their meals). There were two particular dishes I wasn't familiar with - the broccoli and the potato salad. Wow! These were lovely additions to the meal! I finished them completely and so quick! The broccoli was steamed and flavored with sesame oil, simple and yummy. The potato salad was chunky, but also creamy -- a potato salad that was mostly potato and not just a plain mixture of several ingredients. This potato salad highlighted the texture and flavor of the potato well and was a pleasant surprise. I tried their kimchi too, which was fine, but the kimchi at Mother's is better.  Because of the Galbitang, I would definitely visit this place again.

I apologize for my negligence because when I am taking a preemptive strike against a hangover, I come running to you for nourishment and comfort.   Dae Jang Keum is one of the few Korean restaurants that are open 24/7 and doesn't gouge you for it. I swear I am coming to terms with the fact that I need to make it myself, go to K-Town in LA, or move back to Korea to get some of the dishes I miss most.   The menu is large, but has a few time restraints. Having a craving at midnight cuts down the menu, but there are still quite a bit to choose from. Katrina M. asked for something new and would make the waitress do a double take. Was there such a dish available? No, it is as mainstream as you can get. We had ordered the kimchi dolsot bibimbap($13.95). The hot stone pot  crackled while getting to our table, but sadly, there were no charred or crispy rice pieces. The flavors were still amazing. When we broke the over easy egg, the yolk and gochujang bound the rice together nicely. It is searing hot, so watch out. We had also ordered the doenjangjjigae ($9.95). Sometimes it can be too salty from the soybean paste. This one was delicious. Bits of beef, pumpkin, peppers, and blocks of tofu in a stew like broth was good to settle my upset stomach.   From 11pm-6am you can enjoy their happy hour. Have no fear, jumping from one happy hour to another does not mean impending doom.

Lets go to China Town !  Spring Mountain Road ! Wow, low slung (strip malls) see the irony? with hundreds of shops & restaurants. Chinese / Vietnamese / Korean / Japanese. WOW ! Its the Asian invasion of Vegas. Felt like we were explorers who discovered China (oooops I guess it is hard to  discover  since a lot of people live there, to digress even further:  there is a movement to change the record that Chinese merchant seaman discovered America many of hundreds of years before you know who sailed the ocean blue in 1492). Anyhoooo once my fingers hit the key board, they just keep going.   Chose the DJK cos:   1. they were busy but didn't have a long line   2. after a brief walk through (under the ruse to use the bathroom) it was very clean with powerful exhaust fans for the bbq smoke. Alert... not all tables have the bbq grill & fan, so if you are goin  to get the bbq fare, tell them !  3. greeter / sitter / cashier was nice & cheerful, I asked her if we needed to sign in, she responded I know the order and points to the two groups ahead of us....they are #1, and they are #2 and you are #3. Well we had 3 in our 'party' the other groups each had 4+ people. Low and Behold a table for 3 comes up. It was kinda like that old slot machine (since we are on the Vegas thing) where you win if 3 cherries land on the line....anyhooooo I point this out because the greeter then explains to the 2 other parties that a 3 person bbq table just came up and she would like to sit us there ! Wow, courtesy and class at a strip mall in China Town, not to say my expectation did not include those qualities, but at that moment I knew  its goin to be good .  The food at DJK:  Ordered the 3 person set bbq meal (I forget the name, but it was something like 3 queens), a variety of beef (including a sirloin steak) & marinated pork. I think it was $60 or $ 65. With steamed egg (kinda a egg thing like Japanese shawanmushi (sp?) = great,  tofu soup = great (really tasty not tooo salty), kimchi etc. etc. etc. One accompanyment that stood out was the marinated Daicon  (sp?) thin sliced with a delicated marinade - the best. Meat was tender & very fresh. For us tooo much for 3 people, had some of everything left over, and the wait person  asks if we would like to take it to go ? Hmmmm let me think, I am staying at ARIA with no utensils, no plates, and I am going to take bbq meat and aromatic kim chee into the room ? Ahhh no. It pained me to leave behind this great food.   The service at DJK:  Awesome. Attentive & considerate. My only comment would be is that they want to load of the bbq thing with a bunch of meat at once. I kinda had the feeling that it was a  turn-over  strategy, since this shortens the time, wouldn't want the diners to slowly and individually grill.... I can hear  too much time, load grill up, go back stir it up . I actually think they believe it is part of the good service thing. We did not feel rushed.  Why FIVE STARS?

It wasn't very tasty either. I had this strange feeling in my stomach afterwards. Plus, when the soup came out, it wasn't that hot. When you have sundubu, it's supposed to be extremely hot and bubbling. Instead, my sundubu was NOT hot enough...in fact, when I cracked the egg and put it inside, it wasn't cooking. OH MY GOSH. It took a while for the egg to cook, which is not a good sign.   I mean, the staff was super friendly here, and I wish I could rate this place higher, but the food was seriously lacking.

It was bland and did not taste very good.. it was at that moment that I was truly appreciative of all the korean restaurants in SoCal that were able to make this side right. Blessed for reals!   2. Kimchi Stew:  This definitely hit the spot! I have been obsessed with kimchi stews lately and I think this was just as tasty as the one from home ! The stew consisted of some rice cakes, meat and of course can't forget the kimchi!   Two star deduction:  1. Service:  This aspect of the business was horrible! Took forever to wave over a server to take our order and when it came time to get the check I had to walk to the front to request for the check which was ridiculous!  2. Pricing:  The pricing of all the items were very questionable. The portion sizes are the same in comparison to those at home. But it is like literally $5-$6 more dollars.

Even though they were very nice, the amount of time that it took to do these things was a little unacceptable with their practically empty restaurant.   Food: 2 - The silverware is kept on a box near the wall, which I don't like. I feel that it's very unsanitary since anyone can touch your spoon.

We ordered a meal that is meant to be shared.  Three of us shared it.  They bring out all these sides like egg, sprouts, peppers, kimchi.......you name it, it was on the table.  Then they heat up the grill in the middle of the table and put different cuts of beef and pork on it.  YUM!  Its was so tastey, we couldn't stop eating it.

High prices, tiny portions, skimpy on banchan... I can't even. We were most of the way through our meal when I asked my mom if she'd try the kimchi and she said no cause it looked sour, and I agreed saying it looked soggy and wouldn't try it... well,  she tried it and made the most awesome NOPE face. Oh and, apparently I'm not to be acknowledged being half Korean and not being fluent in the language. Thank goodness mom is here to help me out and represent the table. We just got the check and my green tea was $5.. what? The most I've seen is $2 and that's if it's not included. Usually some kind of barley or green or black tea is available by default. But the rice was $2, just random. The menu, dude the menu was $38 for kalbi and japchae was at $21. Mind blown.  The nangmyun was  okay,  the la kalbi was bland and I kept finding bone spurs, very poorly cut meat.   Dae Jang Keum is the name of a very famous female doctor and chef in the Joseon Dynasty (some Korean history for you!). I think this place is trying to bank on its name and location (Chinatown near the strip) but the food portions and quality are low and the menu made me laugh.. out loud. The server was in the corner either picking her teeth or biting her nails and we didn't see her much bit after what I saw I'm okay with that. There are more people working in here than there are customers. Maybe it's a tourist trap, I'd rather drive further to better, and there's a lot better all around here.

She angrily told us that she'll fix it and she promptly came back. She then threw the check down and old us that we had to tip her the minimum of 15%, which was about 11 dollars. Obviously at that point we just paid the amount that was due and did not leave her a tip at all.   I can't believe that she had the audacity to force us to tip her.

We often come here for dinner and sometimes even for their Happy Hour. Their Happy Hour is after 11 PM and you get 20% off your check. We come here often enough for one of the workers there to actually recognize us.   We do realize that there are a lot of Korean BBQ places that offer AYCE and offer cheaper prices than DJK but price isn't really a factor for us. We want the quality and DJK has never failed to deliver that to us. Sure we could go to an AYCE Korean BBQ places but most AYCE Korean BBQ places in Vegas have fallen off the quality latter.   One of my favorite things to order at DJK is their spicy tofu soup. I typically get the version with pork and at medium spicy. Always yummy. I think there only had been one time where it wasn't as flavorful but all the other times it was great. I also love how they would crack in the egg for us too.   We also get an order of pork belly and marinated galbi. What I LOVE is that their galbi is not the thin  LA short ribs  or that's what they usually call them at the supermarket. Their galbi is the huge bone with a strip of meat so you're getting meat meat meat meat meat! ;) Their pork belly is always very yummy too. Some pieces maybe really fatty but it's typically a good combo of meat and fat.   The service can be a bit slow sometimes depending on the time of night but we've never really had any major problems.   Yes, I realize that DJK is not the BEST. I've had better in SoCal but this is not SoCal.

Noodles were served over a  taco  shell.  It tasted okay.  Nothing special. - As for service, they had two waitress waited on us.  One person was a bit too demanding.  It was more of a pressure to order and rush things.  The other person was more calming and allow us time to review.   - Finally, usually at a Korean restaurant, there are like little dishes that they serve as an appetizers.

I can't say menus are cheap but reasonable compare to those Korean restaurants on the strip. Also, Korean food is suppose to be little more expensive because it usually requires massive amount of labor to prepare the ingredient in the right way.  Anyways..

Korean BBQ or Mr. Tofu.  After checking out their small and simple menu at Mr. Tofu, we decided we liked the 'full' Korean experience that D.J.K. was offering.  With no wait on the past Memorial Holiday for dinner, we were seated at  a booth right smack in the middle.  After perusing their extensive menu, we opted for their Dwaeji Galbi (Grilled Pork Ribs) at $22.95, the BF's favorite of Bulgogi Dolsot Bibimbap (Steamed rice with vegetables and beef to mix in the hot stone pot) at $14.95, and the Mul Naengmyeon (Buckwheat noodles with vegetables and meat in chilled broth) at $8.95 based on their picture.  About nine different banchan was brought to us after our order went in.  It included cabbage kim chee, bean sprouts, salad, marinated octopus with pickled cucumbers, daikon, omelet, raw garlic, sliced jalapenos, broccoli and some kind of dipping paste.  The salad had a nice dressing to it, and was pretty good.  The octopus was pretty yummy as well.  We soon discover they are out of Dwaeji Galbi, and ordered the Sanggalbi (Premium beef short ribs) at $26.95 instead.  The beef was good. It wasn't fabulous for the price we paid.  The Bulgogi Dolsot Bibimbap was average.  At first, the rice seemed a bit mushy.  But the stone pot that it came it really crisped up the rice very well.  (Apparently, this was the best the BF has ever had in terms of crispiness.)  The Mul Naengmyeon didn't quite look like the picture it was presented in.  It came with two slices of beef, one hard boiled egg, some veggies, and few pine nuts.  We asked the waitress about it before ordering and she was honest in her opinion, noting that although she enjoys it, it's a bit different for other people.  It's a cold noodle soup dish and I found it refreshing on a hot day.  They also give you vinegar and horseradishy mustard to mix it up with and this gives the broth the much needed quick.    Back in the city, I'm used to getting tea automatically.  But I guess here, you have to ask for it.  At least they don't charge for it though.  I like how the tables are set up here.  At other Korean restaurants, they have to bring this container of hot coals to your table and it's pretty dangerous.  But here, they just turn it on with their gas stove.  And if you aren't going to cook the meat yourself, they simply put the cover on and it's flat like the rest of your table.    The BF was still eating when the cashier girl brought our check to the table.  She didn't even bother asking if we wanted dessert.  (They offer creme brulee, ice cream, etc.)  Asking if they had any shikhye and learning they did not, we were a bit disappointed.  (Had to visit the Asian supermarket next door to get some!)  Service - we had the long-haired waitress.  There's this one short-haired waitress that was not so friendly.  When she initially asked us if we were ready to order, and we asked for another minute, she made a  Huff!  sound.  The BF and I looked at each other like,  WTF?!   Thank goodness the smiley long-haired waitress ended up serving us the rest of the evening and she made up for the bad customer service of the other one.  Side note: The restrooms have these gigantic square sinks.  Watch out for the first stall in the ladies' room 'cuz there's a huge puddle right in front and I think they might have a leakage problem per the previous yelper who mentioned the mess too.

The tofu soup was not the best one I have had, but I'm spoiled by LA Koreatown restaurants, but it was not too bad, it was edible and just what I needed today.  It is also pricier than other korean restaurants in other cities. The Korean bbq seemed overly priced, I usually pay no more tnan $15 per person in LA or even Rowland Heights.

In the far back where the the kitchens are. We all got waters and started browsing the menu. My local friend already knew what she wanted but the rest of us took a minute to decide.  Now, Korean restaurants are notorious for giving shitty service to non Korean customers but my experience here was so much more disrespectful than any other restaurant. First, the ajummas running the place took the orders of the other older Korean party who were seated AFTER us even though we were clearly ready to order. Second, my friends tried to order rice but the lady snapped  oh we outta rice  and instead of letting us know what is available, straight up walked away from us and tended to other patrons.

But the service there is so horrible... I seriously could not do it. I witnessed something so irresponsible happened at this restaurant that could've gotten it into some major trouble if I wanted to complain about it. So instead of going straight to the health district, Im just going to let people who care enough to take time and read reviews about what they eat before they eat it know so that they can beware in the future.   The other night at 4AM, I went to eat there with my boyfriend. We were around the area and decided to eat Korean food since that place was opened all night and had 20% off everything on the menu until 8AM. On first impression walking in, the place seemed clean and spacious with about three booths occupied at that time. The place itself is rather larger than most Korean restaurants, had a cozy feel to it and sits about 60+ people. It was bright with light and seemed suitable for late night gatherings with friends. But, that was about it on the plus side of our experience.  The only waitress working there did not greet us immediately because she was too busy finishing up the spoon she was drying in her hands before getting to us. She was unfriendly, did not speak understandable English and looked as if she was pissed off because we had walked in and now she had more work to do. She sat us down at the table and I saw her immediately go back to finishing up her spoons. She didn't get us water or anything right away. I know most places, that's considered bad service, but I wasn't that picky to fuss about it at that time.The menu itself was similar to most Korean places. It had tofu soup, bbq and combination plates. Nothing too out of the ordinary, however, the price was about $5 more expensive than most places like Tofu Hut and Mr. Tofu. We got the combo with seafood tofu soup and Korean ribs to share and ordered an extra side of rice for $2. She did not bring our drinks out until we got our side dishes. When we ordered the soup, she didn't ask us about our preferred spice levels and didn't even bother to make eye contact with us or let us know she got the ordered. All she did was write it down, said nothing looking away, and walked off leaving us kind of dumbfounded.   The side dishes were very skimpy for 2 people. I understood we only ordered 1 thing, but it was a combination that is close to $16 with $2 extra for rice. She didn't care to accommodate the platings for the party at all, even when it was complimentary.  The soup itself came out boiling, but with dried soup spilled on the side of the clay pot. No one bothered to wipe it off. It wasn't like there was a small amount, you could tell a lot of the soup was spilled on the side. The soup itself tasted good, however. I enjoyed the taste greatly, but to be honest, it was the same as every other Korean resturaunt. Nothing that left a big difference. I noticed for the price they charged, our shrimp in the seafood was baby shrimp and very, very tiny.  When our ribs came out at last (the combo pretty much came out one at a time), there was 6 pieces of ribs and looked very dry. What do you know, it was. The ribs itself was not marinated well enough, there was that sesame oil taste, and slightly sweet.. but that was pretty much it for the ribs. I did not enjoy the ribs at all.   There was 2 people sitting next to us drinking the whole night we were there. On many occasions, I noticed the waitress came over and talk to them, and kept on standing there talking to them in Korean. She payed every attention to that table, and pretty much left us in a corner the whole night. She never bothered to refill our drinks or clean the table that left right when we got there across from us. It was dirty the whole night we were there. She even watched TV and talked to the cook instead of cleaning the table.   OKAY so are you ready for this? One of the guys who were drinking was talking to her before we finished our food. He took out a cigarette and lit it up, smoking in front of our waitress. She did nothing, and continued talking to him in Korean. The other guy smoked afterwards and they both pretty much smoked in the restaurant, with us eating a booth away from them. My boyfriend and I were speechless. They ignored us and kept smoking. At one point, one of the guys got up and with smoke in hand, walked across the restaurant to the restroom hallway. I could not believe how irresponsible this waitress was being. If that was being allowed in the main lobby area, I wonder what goes on in the kitchen where they prepare our foods. I've gone to bars and karaoke lounges where they served food and let us use  cups  as ash trays. But that was different than an actual dine in restaurant such as this. It's like management letting you smoke inside a cheesecake factory. I could not believe it.

It came with a bubbling cauldron of soup & a cauldron of steamed eggs, as well as multiple kinds of meats and soju. We substituted a large sapporo for the soju. We shared another beer later and for the four of us, the bill ended up being less than $90. The amount of meat we were given was quite a huge portion, so they definitely weren't skimping! It came with a bowl of steamed rice and two different sauces, as well as bean paste, seasoned lettuce, cabbage kimchi, seaweed salad, radish kimchi, beansprouts & broccoli. The banchan tasted fresh enough when we arrived, despite it being after 2AM. The kimchi had good tang but didn't taste old, the bean sprouts were still crunchy, etc. The meat had good flavor, though the pieces of pork were almost entirely fat. I like undercooked bacon and enjoy a good piece of pork belly now and again, but it was too rich to have more than a few bites. There were occasional bone fragments left, so be aware. Overall a satisfying bit of meal and plenty of food for 2-4 people depending on the depth of your hunger.   A good selection of meats and a surprising little 24 hour restaurant in the same shopping center as Mr. Tofu & Pho Kim Long. There were korean gameshows blaring loudly in the background and most of the customers and staff were korean. A couple that came in after us departed long before we did.

We ordered the BBQ for two. It came with samgyupsal, chadul, and yangnyum gogi. Also came with egg casserole and dwenjang jjigae. It was absolutely wonderful, oh yeah it also comes with a bottle of soju and all of that just for around 45 dollars. Which isnt bad at all one order of samgyup in orlando is 20 and there is a minimum order of two which brings you to a total of 40...so WAY cheaper than Orlando.  The service was wonderful, since Orlando has such a small Korean community my husband and I asked the waitress about what Vegas has for a Korean community he really just wanted to know about the hwaro hwe (live sashimi). So she told us everything we needed to know and when the bill came she gave us a twenty dollar discount!! So our meal came out to about thirty dollars so what we would have paid we just left as tip for her.

Usually the waitresses will scoop the rice out of the stone pot for you -- instead they came and dropped off a plastic pitcher of hot water with my friends who had the kalbitang.

They told us there would be a wait so we sat patiently and waited meanwhile while we waited tons of people were being seated that just walked through the door after us. I was fine with that because we were hungry and patient to wait to eat something good.  When we finally got seated we didn't get water for about 10 minutes and then probably menus long after. A woman came over to us and started to take our order but when the phone rang, she ran to the phone. She came back and said she was  off  but she would take our order anyway and then the phone rang again and she ran away again.  At this point I'm wondering WHY the customer service at the table is less important then the phone ringing. And if she was off, why not get a waitress that was working to help us? The fact is is that we were the only non-Asian in the restaurant and nobody wanted to help us. This place caters to Asians only. When a woman finally came to take her order she was mad she threw down the menus.. She was huffing and puffing about having to even stand there talking to us. Maybe she was irritated that we had two orders for there and one order to go or maybe she was just irritated that she didn't understand English and she got stuck with our table. Or maybe she just hated her job?? I'm not sure what it was??  Now I am in the customer service industry.  I work literally around the corner from this place.

Their kimchi is always ripe and starting Nov, they introduced new kimchi stew that's really good. I ask them to add rice cakes (dduk) to it. It's really tasty.  Over the years, I think they've gotten enough non-Korean speakers so their service has improved. Recently I noticed one of their serving staff doesn't speak Korean, so that was new.  Their main problem is that the facility has been around for 20 years or so, it's not shiny. But in terms of food, it's pretty good.

We were pretty excited / tired / hungry after dancing and partying all EDC weekend and also because we were all preparing to go to the airport in just a few hours.  We strolled into Dae Jang Keum and thought, hmmm it smells pretty good... and the pleasant experience went downhill from there. As we were deciding what to order, we wanted to order a smaller package (bbq for 3 and then 3 apps since there were 3 girls and 2 guys... typically Asian girls don't eat a lot either) for the bbq so we could order more sides and apps.  We weren't trying to be cheap, we just didn't want a bbq buffet at our table when we wanted to try some appetizers. Well, this didn't sit too well with the waitress... but also keep in mind we were heading to the airport shortly... who wants to smell like bbq on a 5 hour flight? Anyway, after ordering, whatever we asked for afterwards... like more tea, clean plate, utensils, whatever you name it, she would give us a dirty look and just  plopped it on our table. It was also uncomfortable to ask when the soju we ordered was coming.  Overall, the food was pretty decent. It was delicious and the price was alright.

Then I opened the menu and discovered that each plate of meat cost at least 20 dollars. It took me aback a bit because I'm used to eating at all you can eat places for under $20.

Each plate was a sufficient portion for one person and the meat was no better than the aforementioned all you can eat joints.  Our waitress was really nice but she seemed to be the only person working the floor. This is one of those places where the waitress does the cooking for you so due to the fact that she was inundated with tables and we were hungry, we ultimately had to take over cooking duties for her.

I always ask for it as spicy as humanly possible, and they bring it out mild to medium-hot almost every time.   One of the great things they offer on their menu is their combination (tofu stew + galbi, korean short-ribs) for $14.95 so with the locals discount 20% off, it's a fantastic deal.   I have tried various other items on the menu and the food is overall good... so I WOULD recommend it to people; however, do not expect the greatest of service.

The parking lot of this strip mall was very crowded and we had to park several store fronts away but the restaurant is family friendly (at least during dinner) so that's a plus. My preschooler loved the food and the staff didn't seem to mind that she dropped her fork a few times and we needed extra napkins (those with kids know how meal time can be).

I don't live in this area so I probably won't visit this place again, but I would if I came back.  The service was a bit lagging, since all they were required to do was bring a few slabs of raw meat to our table.   We ordered a tofu- ribs combination (sorry I don't know names) and 2 plates of meat: more specifically beef. We ordered one plate of delicious marinated ( Korean style bbq) tender beef and one plate of beef ( Chagol something or other.)  My whole family unanimously agreed that both types of beef were delicious, but I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND the marinated beef if you were to get one type of beef.   The waitresses/ waiters give you a bowl of rice in the beginning, and the tofu was delicious with that. Now, as I said before, we ordered a tofu- ribs combination. The ribs were fantastic, some of the best I've had. Trust me, I've had a lot of ribs ( Im a meat person).  Pretty high class, nice, modern decoration.

Although, I am a fan of the wall of celebrities that can be seen when you enter DJK...I also am a fan of the mini Asian figurines.   On my past two visits, I ordered the Sundubu- a bubbling bowl of spicy soup filled with silken tofu, onions and your choice of meat- sans egg. The first time, I ordered the Haemul Sundubu, which came with an assortment of seafood (shrimp, clams, mussels and calamari). The flavor was good, but some of the seafood was not the best quality. On the second visit, I ordered the Plain Sundubu, which came with pieces of pork belly. The broth was a little salty and much more oily than I like my Sundubu to be. The banchan served were okay as well. I did enjoy the pickled garlic stems. I also enjoyed the complimentary hot tea that they serve.  For good Korean food, I don't have to venture far from my own home. But when I'm out and about late at night and I'm craving Korean, DJK is on my list.

Everything was mediocre and disappointing with this restaurant.  This restaurant only has tables with the bbq grill in the center and parties of 7 are shoved into a little booth with a chair at the end.  They seriously need more table space if they are going to put out banchan and food items.  Due to the fact that the table was so crowded, a glass of water was knocked over.  The waiter...stood there and didn't offer assistance, no towel or additional napkins.  The box with the chopsticks was emtpy, we asked for chopsticks.  We had to ask a few times before chopsticks were brought over.  At one point we asked for additional napkins, and the waiter told us they were available on top of the counter and we could help ourselves!!!  Excuse me?! What did they hire you for? This last encounter with the waiter pretty much sums up the customer service at this place.    Onto the food, the banchan consists of kim chee, pickled cucumbers and radishes, bean sprounts, mashed potato, and broccoli.  Probably the lamest combo of banchan and the least tasty version I've ever seen.  I've had food court Korean with better banchan selection.  I was craving cold buckwheat noodles, since I was introduced to it at Soyo the week before.  However, this place obliterated my craving probably forever.  The noodles are thinner than the first version I had and clumpy.  The beef broth tasted like MSG water....it was altogether a horrible dish.  The galbi was overly sweet and didn't have a nice char on the outside.  The bimbimbap was just average.  The seafood pancake also was mushy and didn't have the crispy exterior that some places can achieve.  The sundubu is definitely not as good as Mr. Tofu....there's a reason why people pick this place as plan B.  Although Mr. Tofu has a much more limited menu, the prices for basic items like tofu soup, noodles, bimbimbap are probably $5 less over at Mr. Tofu.

I guess something about the food in this place I find better than other places around it.  We usually tend to go for their Korean barbecue combinations which is either Love or Queen.  Why get something I can get across the street for cheap?!  Quality over quantity my friend.  This restaurant has also never been closed down by Southern Nevada Health District so I feel far more comfortable eating here than the latter.  Now back to their food, combinations usually come with beef brisket, pork loin, beef flank, soy bean soup, steamed eggs and unlimited serving of salad and homemade banchans (Korean side dishes).  One downside about this place is their service.  Perhaps, I've never really gone here at an earlier time but being the only group at 3 am and still not get decent assistance is quite surprising.  I'm not asking for them to cook every single meat we have on our table as I can do that myself.  If I had to stand up and serve myself water or chase down the server because I want more kimchi is just not cool.  Overall, Dae Jang Keum is one of the better Korean restaurants in the valley.

I'm not sure if it was because we went during full-price hours or if it was because we were with a large group, or maybe they just decided to be nice that day. I can't really say. One thing's for sure, though...I was glad for the change.  I'm kind of at awe at how different the two experiences I had there were. The food was sooo much better! The meat actually had some flavor, and that disgusting garlic oil crap from last time was actually a pleasant dipping sauce this time. Even the little side dishes were better! And the salad was just as good.  The service was also loads better. They actually took care of us! I feel like that's pretty darn important when eating out. Our waiter was extremely patient with the ordering process, since it always takes a while to decide how the ordering and sharing goes down in big groups. They filled our water cups, they flipped the meat for us, and they actually cut the big mushrooms that come with it, which we definitely noticed since it was impossible to eat those the first time.  Two bad things from this trip: chopsticks and bathroom. This place should definitely invest in some better chopsticks because trying to eat with these sharp-edged-blocked chopsticks was painful. The whole all-black thing with their bathrooms might be cool (or creepy) since it kind of reminded me of Magneto, but one toilet was backed up and the other had pee (or some other liquid, since all I saw was black) all over the seat and ground. Ew. But I guess that's more the fault of stupid customers, eh? I'm sure it'll be cleaned up by the end of the day... =\  Despite those two things, it was really a great experience this time around. I wish I could give it more stars, but I'll just say this is an average of the two times I've been.  ---------------------------------------------  I can't say I've been to many Korean barbecue places, but I do know I enjoyed every single one until I came to this one. Perhaps we just didn't know how or what to order. But I feel like that should never be much of a problem with restaurants. Even if it's not the favorite item that everyone orders, it should still be somewhat good.  So we ordered some beef that was extremely bland. It was also pretty fatty and came with a sort of garlic oil dipping sauce that just made it even more fatty. I still had the icky taste of the oil in my mouth the next morning even after some good brushing, flossing, and rinsing. The glass noodle dish that we got after was pretty good. It was definitely the better of the two. I didn't care much for all the little side dishes, but the beef one and the kimchi were pretty good. The salad that came with everything was good as well. It just sucks that the main 'bbq' part of our meal was the worst.  The place looks nice inside, and it's pretty spacious with comfortable booths. The service was nice when it came, although it was pretty sporadic. I think the prices are comparable to other Korean places, but the place did kind of redeem itself with it's 20% off happy hour from 11pm-8am. (They're open 24 hours.) I hear it used to be 50% off when they first opened, and you'll only find me back there if they fall back to that.", "Date": "2007-03-15", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Viet", "ReviewID": "IVLlYHvps9C-Ou1bDGrXwA", "Overall": "2", "Content": "I was craving korean bbq one night and decided I'd eat somewhere I've never been before, so I ended up at this place. I ordered a combo that came with some spicy tofu soup and a few pieces of short ribs for $18. The tofu soup honestly tasted like mildly spicy water, there was hardly any flavor. The short ribs were somewhat good. The whole time while I was eating, nobody came to my assistance asking if I needed anything else. Minutes later a young lady came and asked me to pay even when I wasn't even done with my food (I found this kind of rude). I told her I wanted to order something else because I was still kind of hungry, so I went and ordered some beef cubes which came out to be $28 (Pretty pricey for a plate with a few pieces of meat). She still insisted me on paying for my first meal and then pay for the other stuff later. The beef came out to be a little over cooked, there was no juiciness to it. The whole entire time, still, no one came to ask me if everything was okay. I wasn't too satisfied with the customer service. All in all, I could've gotten all you can eat korean bbq over at Korean Garden, Tofu Hut, or Sura for way less with better service.

They have a locals discount of 10% if you show them a valid ID. I ordered the bulgogi bento box and my friends both got the tofu soup. The owner is really nice...

My bulgogi bento came with this egg appetizer, rice, salad, orange and Gyoza. The tofu soup came with rice and also the rice porridge made from the stone pot they cooked the rice in. Food was really good. The tofu soups had a lot of flavor.   My bulgogi was sweet and juicy. I liked this place because they were not stingy with the side dishes...

Plus is that it's open 24/7, cons is that you are definitely not getting nearly the quality you pay for...It was $20 just for japchae, a usual banchan (side) in Korea/anywhere else, and though presentation was...strangely extravagant for such a common dish, the flavor just didn't authentic. That, along with everything else we ate, tasted more Chinese than Korean. I'd rather go to the other Americanized 24/7 Korean joint on the strip than venture out to here.
