They greet when when you walk in the door which i love, Its iffy if you give you the homemade chips to eat with BBQ sauce when you are waiting on your food. The service could use a tad bit of improvment, consistancy in if you get the chips, checking back to see if you need something, there have been many times we never got refills on our drinks or had to wait a long time to get check and togo boxes. The food is tasty sometimes the ribs can be tough but they have no prob taking them back and replacing them. I would not recomend the ribtips they tend to be over cooked. My husbands favorite is the sweetwater catfish he has never had a complaint about them. I love the mac n cheese with corn and jalapeno's in them so tasty it's my favorie side they offer.

The servers are always very nice, friendly and helpful.  I love the ribs and hot links.  The various sauces and very nce.....  The reason they don't get 5 stars has to do with the speed at which you can walk in, have lunch, and leave.  It is better to have about an Hour or more as it may take some time to be seated, and then place your order.   Then there is the wait time for the food, which is usually good, but then again to receive your bill, etc... it all takes time, which you may not have.  One thing they could do is seat people faster, or hand out menus when they arrive so that while waiting, they could be picking out their meals.     I am a member of their email club.  They send out a free meal for birthdays ( with purchase of a meal).   Dave's personal life story is inspiring..... If you like hot sauce.... order the Wilbur's Revenge Sauce.

We cleaned two plates ourselves and asked for one replacement,  but the replacement had unwashed BBQ sauce on it too. Getting nervous about this location. When the sampler appatizer came,  the black plastic service tongs were sticky. Held them up to the light and sure enough, clearly not washed at all. They had BBQ finger prints all over them.    That was the last straw. The manager came by about then and I told him that his location is too dirty to trust and that we couldn't eat there.

Every single time she approached any of her tables EACH of these  terms of endearments  came out of her mouth. I lost count after about the 30-40 times we heard or experienced them. So unprofessional and annoying. And then when we refused her offer of dessert she  jokingly  called us lightweights. C'mon now, really? We couldn't have gotten out of there fast enough.

This was an incredibly poor quality visit.  I was so disappointed with this place when we took my husband for his birthday. We were expecting a large group of people for the celebrations, so, being a courteous diner, I called them to notify them at 1pm that we'd be showing up with a large group at 7pm, so they could be prepared. (We were expecting 18 at the time, and we know that can be hard to accommodate...) The girl seemed disinterested in taking any information, and said she would know who we were and be prepared.   I became wary about two hours later, so I called and spoke to some rude man who kept interrupting me with  We don't do reservations.  I'm sorry, but when it's a large party, you TAKE A FUCKING RESERVATION so that you don't end up with a ton of annoyed people cluttering up your lobby area while waiting for you to be prepared for something that was called in hours before.  Since it was too late at that time to change plans, we showed up. We had to wait 20+ minutes to be seated, had to ask numerous times for serving plates for our appetizers, etc... We also told them at the beginning of ordering how we would be splitting the checks up, and we were very specific about it. The server/bartender said he understood and would make sure it was taken care of.   Service was slow as shit, the drinks were extremely weak, and when one of our guests asked what items did not have MSG (she's allergic to it) the bartender took over 30 minutes to tell her that... he didn't know. (Upon calling corporate, I found out that they have allergen menus for people with all sorts of allergies...) The only thing he was sure about was that the macaroni and cheese side dish did not contain it. (He gave her a tiny side dish of it for free, but didn't offer her a larger portion, so she had about three bites to eat for dinner... she decided to go to McDonalds after, so she could actually have food.)  When it came time to split the check, the bartender fucked it up. He charged one of our guests who was just paying for his girlfriend and himself, the amount for most of the group... roughly 15x what he was expecting to pay. This fuck up brought the guest 15 cents away from overdraft. It took over 30 minutes to get them to correct their mistake, and the bartender said after the screw up  Well I didn't think you guys were going to tip anyway...  (For the record, he got a 20% tip, even though the staff really didn't deserve any...)  Called their corporate office and explained this fiasco to their customer relations department. Was promised a callback the next day, haven't heard from them at all. It's been 3 weeks. No attempt to rectify the situation or retain us as customers.   Thanks, but I'll go to Memphis or somewhere that actually gives a shit about their customers next time... screw you guys at Famous Dave's.

There was a whole chicken, brisket, a rack of ribs, baked beans, cole slaw, corn on the cob, corn bread muffins and potato wedges.  We also ordered fried onion strings and fried pickles as appetizers.  We left so full.    The ribs were tender and fell of the bones.  I don't like ribs and tore into these like nobody's business.  The brisket, while fatty (we were warned), was delicious and had a beautiful smoke ring. The bark on it was awesome.  I could not stop eating it.  I wash the was more on the platter even with all the other goodness going on.  The cole slaw was traditional as were the beans.  Good but traditional.  The potato wedges were a good way to try all of the six BBQ sauces Famous Dave's has to offer.  There are five on the table and the sixth (XXX) you have to ask for because it is so hot.  I didn't find it so bad but I only used it sparingly on a starchy vessel.  That seemd to cut the heat to more manageable than I've heard in stories from my dad.  The one part of the meal I was not happy with was the corn on the cob.  It was overcooked and soggy for my liking but that is pretty normal from a busy restaurant in my experience.  They can't very well cook it to order.    Aside from that, even the leftovers were bangin'.

And that is O.K. with me.... every once in a while.  And, with that said... tonight we went to Famous Daves BBQ near the Galleria Mall.     - We went early (5 pm.)  I came in with my folks and aunt so of course they want to eat early.  It seems that as soon as you hit a certain age your clock changes or something.  But, I'll deal with it.  So needless to say, we were seated right away and our drink orders were taken.  Rachel was our server for the night and she was on top of it!!!  Brought us out chips and to make sure we were good.   - And, no kidding... Less than 10 minutes later our food came out.  I have never had problems with the food here.  It has always been plentiful and comes out hot.  I couldn't eat my fries for the first 5 minutes of our meal.  No complaints though.  I had the ribs and wing platter.    Side note:  Maybe this is just me... I love ribs and BBQ sauce but I always feel weird eating ribs in public.  I feel like a slob because I know that sooner or later it's going to get all over me.  Anyhow, back to my review.   - The rest of my family were very happy with their meals as well.  I got a  to go box  partly because I was getting full and the other was the slob like feeling I was having.  My aunt then said let's do dessert.  So, Rachel brought out a dessert menu and I said to my family...  Let's share a couple of desserts   They weren't having any of it because they wanted their own.  Even though we all ended up having the Hot Fudge Sundae.  They came out and they were huge.  We ended up leaving a lot of it on the table.  I reminded them that we should have split them.  I think Rachel thought it was funny as well as she chuckled a couple of times at us sitting in front of these huge desserts.  I felt like a total glutton...   -  For 4 meals with dessert, soda's and a couple of glasses of wine... the bill came out to 108 bucks / 130 after tip.

Earlier that day, I passed the Famous Dave's and thought,  I'm going to try it tonight.   This location is super close to my house and super convenient.  I love BBQ so this is a match made in BBQ heaven.    This restaurant is in Mall Ring circle right off of Sunset Ave.  I decided to take out for the sake of my sickness.  I called in to place my order and Kelsie was my hostess. It was a very awkward greeting. She literally said  thank you for calling famous Dave's how can I help you- oh my goodness!  I asked her if she was alright and she didn't answer me, so I just ordered.  The restaurant is a warm comforting place, similar to other BBQ restaurants.  The thing about BBQ restaurants is that you feel like you're on someone's porch. There's lots of knock knack decorations all over the place. There's a separate area for the to-go orders.  By that door, there's a help yourself bucket full of moist towelettes, BBQ sauce packed and plastic utensils. Very convenient.  The takeout  area is spacious and allows for a bunch of people which I fully appreciate!  For dinner, I got the Rib and Burnt End plate for $18.49.  You get a 1/3 portion of St. Louis ribs, a heaping serving of burnt ends served on Texas toast.  The two sides I chose was the corn on a cob and potato salad.  This plate also came with a corn bread muffin, pickled onions and pickle chips.  The St. Louis ribs were a little more marbleized than the baby back ribs that I'm used to.  It was just seasoned, not mopped with BBQ sauce.  The burnt ends were a little too salty for me.  Brisket ends, charred up with BBQ sauce and more seasoning.  The corn bread muffin was literally my saving grace to the saltiness of the burnt ends.  It was perfectly baked.  I thought the potato salad was too much with the onion flavor, could have gone a little less with that.  The corn was also perfectly prepared.  Two small cuts of cobs great side!  Overall, I've tasted better BBQ, however, this place is still good.  It's conveniently located and prepares food very quickly.

We've been to the other location at Blue Diamond several times. We came here on sunday (our 1st visit to this location) to cash in on a birthday coupon promotion- buy one entree, get one free (join the club online). We requested a booth. There is a ton of seating here (several dining rooms) and there is ample parking as well. There was a pretty good lunch crowd here; also family-friendly. This location used to be a steakhouse but the chain failed and closed up shop.   All tables come equipped with salt, pepper, ketchup, a roll of paper towel, some menus and the five signature sauces- rich and sassy (my favorite), devil's spit (very hot), georgia mustard (vinegar based), sweet and zesty (another good one), and texas pit (tomato based). We forgot which ones we liked so we sampled them all.    On the back of the menu, there is a set of daily early bird specials, so that's what we ordered- the two meat special that came with one side and a corn bread muffin, and we opted for an extra side for $2.29. (After our drinks came, we got a small salted and seasoned freshly made chips.) I chose the brisket and the roasted chicken while my husband got the chopped pork and brisket (said that there was some fatty pieces and that the skin made it crunchy, so he will not order this again). There was very little fat on the brisket which was a good thing (I always cut the fat off everything). Several slices with some sauce topped a single slice of soft white bread (I took a bite but didn't finish it). The chicken (breast and wing) was really good, moist, not overdone, though I didn't finish it. For my sides, I chose the mac & cheese (hint of jalapenos) and the fries (thick, skin-on, crisp). The mac & cheese was excellent. I liked the fries too, not greasy and mushy. I gave some fries to my husband. My husband got the mac & cheese and coleslaw. I took my corn muffin home to eat later. We'd been craving BBQ and this really hit the spot.  Service was really good. Both our drinks, and food came out pretty quickly. Our server came to check on us several times, and gave us refills without us asking (love that). He was also helpful when it came to the menu, we had questions on the heat of the mac & cheese (my husband can take a hint but not much).

I had such a bad experience back in April 2011 when this location opened that I didn't go back for awhile. 14 months later I finally decided to give them another try and place a carry out order.   The person who took my order over the phone was nice and helpful. Apparently there is a special website: famousdaveslv.com that has the local menu on it which differs somewhat from the national menu. After taking a look at it we settled on mac & cheese from the kids menu with a side of spiced apples, Texas Beef Brisket with spicy mac & cheese and cole slaw, and a BBQ Chicken Sandwich with a side of Wilbur Beans. $29 got us three little black plastic boxes and a styrofoam cup of milk for the kids meal.   So when we get it home we open the bag up and we're looking at $30 worth of food and we're like where's it at? Appearances / non-standard portion sizes aside, it didn't taste much better and all the Rich & Sassy sauce you can smother it with didn't help. The brisket was over cooked and tasted like double corrugated cardboard. The spicy apples looked like someone dumped a big spoonful of spice on top and it looked bad and tasted like crap. The BBQ chicken? Awful! Bleech! Boring, flat, I thought this was BBQ? It sure doesn't taste like any BBQ I know! And being from Kansas City, one of the 4 established American capitals of BBQ I know BBQ.   I could go on and on but the fact is the dog ate well last night with half the brisket going to him, my 2 year old ended up spitting out the mac and cheese and the apples, and pretty much everything else ended up being put in a nice 30 gal plastic trash bag for Republic Services to take it where it belongs. The landfill. It was so bad I found myself thinking Sysco's horrible  BBQ  meat - just add their special food service sauce  would have tasted better than this slop.   I promised my wife that for as long as we live in Vegas, I will never ask her to have Famous Dave's again. Ugh, why did I torture my family by thinking this would be any good? They deserve better, and so do you. Don't go here.  Edit: After finishing writing this review I looked over at the dog bowl and the brisket is still there.

I like to go to restaurants where the staff smiles, and makes you feel welcome. It was 11 am and our waitress wanted to know if we wanted margaritas.  Really?  At 11 am?  How many alcoholics come into this place?  She should have asked if we wanted anything to drink, and just left it at that.  Are there really that many people who are drinking before noon?

Lastly, and this is the one which bothers me the most - we have a punch card where if you buy 5 lunches you get one free.  Except you don't.  Unless you're a single diner.  It works like this:  When you buy a lunch they punch the card, and after 5 punches, you get a free lunch.  BUT, if there are two of you, they make you use TWO cards, so you're actually buying TEN lunches to get one.  In reality, when you buy two lunches, there should be two punches on one card.  That's the way it works at other restaurants I have cards at - they don't make you purchase two lunches and then punch it only one time.

Chains are just that, chains.  They are typically the same everywhere.  But, I do have a reason to review Famous Dave's, and it's not a good one.  I used to work near Famous Dave's and we ate here often, if not once a week, definitely once every 2 weeks for lunch.  My favorite was the Cajun chicken sandwich.  A Cajun spiced chicken breast with spicy remoulade on a soft but firm bun with fried onions, cheese, and veggies.  It was fantastic.  Well, I don't work near here anymore, but the wife and I were out the other day and decided to hit up Famous Dave's for nostalgia purposes.  We were seated immediately and drink orders taken promptly.  So far so good.  I ordered my usual sandwich.  When it arrived, the bun was different.  Vastly different.  It was sort of like a weak ciabatta, but crumbly.  It fell apart almost immediately after I started eating.  No integrity whatsoever.  The chicken was not seasoned, it was just a grilled piece of chicken on the bun.  And, it was left on the grill too long in spots, so those great char grilled marks turned into burned spots on the chicken that gave you a bitter flavor.  There were several of them.  The onions and sauce were the same, which I expected.  But, the devil's in the details, and the failure to season the chicken was a substantial failure.  Even with the sauce I liked and fried onions (always a good addition to anything) the sandwich couldn't be saved.  We will probably return and give it another shot.

Once you start eating these, it's difficult to stop.   We each got the 2 meat lunch special. I got the BBQ chicken, and the ribs. It was 1/4 chicken with a dry rub, and two ribs. I was served the white meat chicken, while my mother-in-law was given dark meat. There was quite a bit of meat on both the chicken and the ribs. We each got a corn muffin along with the meat, and a choice of a side. I got the potato salad, which had a bit of what I am guessing was pickle relish. I am not a fan of relish, but it was just a touch and was pretty tasty.   My MIL asked for extra butter, and was given a small cup of whipped butter. What comes with the muffins are small plastic containers of butter, so this was a nice touch. I like that there is roll of paper towels at the table...no need to ask for extra napkins...and many different BBQ sauces to choose from.

So they must have ran the card Before their system froze & ran it again when it came back online. Since this was over $70.00 charge, with a tip, I called the restaurant to notify them, this morning..  I spoke to  Deb, ...she said she was the Manager...they NEED a new Manager!!!!!! While trying to explain to her what happened,  she would not let me get a word in edge-wise...she just said, well it's your banks fault & you need to talk to them if they take it twice...Wait?! What?! Your waitress ran my card TWICE, that is why I have the two (same) charges! WHY is it my bank's fault. I was  trying  my best to explain to her that I would have to file a Fraud Report with my bank, that is ONLY way the bank will reverse the charge...when I know that all she could have said was, come in with the same card, when you see the second charge post, & we'll reverse the charge to that card! NO, she went on interrupting me...how in the world is this person a  manager ?...good managers are suppose to LISTEN to the complaint, & try to SOLVE the problem, & defuse any issue(s)...I couldn't even get a word in edge-wise!!!!! Why should I have to go to my bank, in her words,  it's your bank's fault for letting it go through two times...& you would have to fix it with them!  Listen, my bank wasn't the one who charged me! It say's Famous Dave's on the 2 charges! I was trying to tell her that I would allow 2-4 dys for the charges to be fixed, if I still see 2 charges fr Famous Dave's after three dys have past, then I would come in with my bank account info, on my smart phone, showing where the 2 charges have been deducted so Manager can do Reversal to the same card...I never got to finish my sentence because,once again, I was cut-off mid sentence... Deb  would not listen to my complaint & would not budge on the fact that they made a mistake, sorry we ran the same card twice! ... Somehow, it was real  easy  to find the charge & 4 ending numbers to the card that was used...so there must have been issue...with every card/person using a charge/bebit card when their system crashed...& I was one of the few who waited this long to bring it to their attention. Long story short, I hung up on their so-called manager!...she needs SERIOUS training in Billing & Customer Care! ...if I go to my bank to  reverse the charge  it will take me having to file a Fraud Report & it can take up to 30 dys to get the money back! Where does  Deb,  live,  under a rock?  That she has never dealt with a bank!!!! Everyone knows that a business/restaurant, can do a reversal & it would take a few dys to credit back charge! ...my family & I WERE regulars there, to the point where even the waitress knows what drinks to bring us even before we ask, & she does...we are Not ever returning to this restaurant!!! & thank goodness for the internet &  word of mouth,  because I will let all my friends know to avoid this place. Or PAY IN CASH ONLY!!! Listen this so-called manager, I dealt with, was very abnoxious to the wrong person...I ran companies for a living, & I know to go to the Attorney General & the BBB, when you're dealing with  money matters,  & issues like these. I will be filing an Attorney General complaint against Famous Dave's if I see a second charge post in a few days, & my bank doesn't reverse it!

I'd give 3.5 stars if I could.   Anyone with a closed minded singular view of bbq, such as texas  or carolina or memphis or santa rosa is sure to find it all wrong. However, If you enjoy slow cooked meat, you'll find something to like at Famous Dave's. They have a variety of meats and styles and sauces and sides etc, there is something for everyone. When I have a craving for ribs, I now go to Famous Dave's. It is far easier and cheaper than doing it myself or going to L.A.  As for how it sucks less than the rest - The service is always good and friendly. The table, menus etc are always clean. They have comfortable seating.They have metal cutlery, not horrible little plastic things. They have never been out of anything or  not ready yet  either.

I adored the trash can lid that the 3 meat platter was served on. Hilarious!   I feel that being a chain, this place sure knows good BBQ. I'm from Texas, trust me. Since I don't have that luxury of BBQ on every corner anymore at my disposal, this place does not disappoint and is my new substitute BBQ place here in Vegas.   The 3 meat combo had everything we wanted off the menu so we did it for two people. Brisket, Ribs and Chicken!! Brisket and the Ribs were my favorite. Juicy not over cooked. Chicken was good as well.  The sides were plenty and we subbed the coleslaw for veggies. Jalepeno mac-n-cheese was surprisingly good.  Lots of food left over actually and so worth it; for the price you can't beat it and so I strongly recommend it.   We ordered sweet teas and they were perfect! Not too sweet and its probably a disgrace to call it sweet tea bc it was more like half and half tea.  I just relocated from South Carolina and the tea down there is sweet. I mean DIABETES sweet! I was worried it would be true southern iced tea but it wasn't. And I was glad for it!   The only thing we didn't order was dessert. This place is quite good. Much better value and quality than Buzz BBQ. I think that Memphis has good Carolina BBQ so if you are into pulled pork, you should try them first.

We came around 9:30 PM on a Sunday night, 30 minutes before they were closing. We were gonna come earlier but The Walking Dead was on and it didn't end til 9 PM.   Our waitress was Stephanie and I thought she was great! She was very friendly and bubbly! The manager even said hi and welcomed us as he walked by.  Even though I'm trying to eat less meat, I still ordered the Texas Beef Brisket w/mac and cheese, and fries (can't go to a BBQ place and not eat meat).  My boyfriend ordered the combo with the ribs and brisket w/mac and cheese, and fries. The brisket was tender and full of flavor. I didn't try any of the bf's ribs but he said it was good even though it was not  fall off the bone ribs . I liked the mac and cheese as it had bits of jalapeno in it to give it a little kick, however my bf didn't care too much for it. We both liked the fries, it wasn't greasy.  I noticed that the host seated a huge party of 10 or 12 people about 5 minutes before closing time, and I thought that was really cool of them. I'm not sure how many restaurants out there will still seat a huge party right before closing time.   I only ate half my meal so I got a to-go box but ended up leaving it on the table when we left. I remembered when we were already in the car and were about to leave the parking lot. My boyfriend tried going back in but they had already locked the doors so he ended up calling the restaurant.

We opted for the BBQ for 2, for which we had a coupon. That was the best part.... Awkward extremely bright lights at the tables, the Manager walked by several times smiling ( we have no idea what for-- this was not a happy place to be) but never stopped to check in, neither did our server -- ever-- or any of the other 4 servers who were too busy detailing their closed sections to high-tail it out as soon as they could. Our server did have time to stand and chat it up with her friends at the table across the way-- proving she has a personality but not willing to share it with us. Too bad, having been in the service industry and FOH manager for years, I'm an excellent tipper for good service.  Such a bummer, really wanted to enjoy our time together but this was definitely NOT the place for that! Astoundingly awful service.

This particular restaurant has excellent service but the food is a little bit of a let down. The waitstaff are always attentive and helpful here, even when the place is hopping.  The food though is a little lacking. The smoked bbq chicken is good, but rubbery. The ribs have almost no meat, save some serious slabs of fat, and the corn on the cob is too small. However, the brisket is pretty good. They have several sauces, which are all relatively sweet (except the Georgia sauce - which I love), so I hope you have your sweet tooth ready.

Now that there is a location near us we were pleased to have a Famous Daves close by. The Henderson location was just as good as the Blue Diamond restaurant, but something changed las year and the last Que for 2 was pretty lousy. I acutally like the BBQ burger instead, but the place should have good BBQ ribs, but sadly something has changed it's tough, soggy ribs with no real taste like it used to be. I left uneaten meat that is fatty left on the bone. The sides are tiny tiny and they seem to be saving on product for some reason. Even the corn bread muffin is 1/3 the size it used to be.

I was complimented several times on the way to the table and our drinks were filled and food was great! ENTREES: I ordered the manhandler (brisket and a smidge of sausage on top) The bf ordered the brisket plate. Both were great.  SIDES: I went w/ the beans OMG so good. Bf went w/ mac n cheese.. good but nowhere near as good as blue's bbq was that closed down on the other side of the galleria. . (for not paying rent from what I hear)  2nd VISIT: nowhere near as good. It was like night and day from our 1st visit and left a lot to be desiered. . .   We arrived around 745.. not too late. we ordered the que for 2. perfect for us. RIBS: the ribs were eh. the 1st piece was good but as you moved further in to the rib the worse they got and harder and not falling off the bone, by the last rib they were just plain tough.  BRISKET: it was ok. not as good as 1st visit CHICKEN: pretty good. didnt have it the 1st time so we had nothing to compare it to.  it was good but I was too full to have more than a bite.   Beans were great again. . how can u mess up beans?   SERVICE: omg. . WOW. the girl never refilled our drinks not even once. my bf was tempted to go fill his own glass. i dared him to but he never did. i gave him the rest of my tea. so then I was thirsty. the girl disappeared on us after 20 minutes of us being done we had to ask another waitress nearby if she could bring our ck b/c we just wanted to get out of there.   the girl showed up long enough to bring the ck. w/e - not sure if i'll go bk. this left a bad taste in my mouth. We are from TX and this place is nowhere near as good as TX bbq but its as close as we can get in this area. . but my love works too hard for his $ to spend it at a place that cant give us consistent food. .   the bf had to ask for a plate not once but 2x.. . as well as paper towels b/c our booth had none. finally the waitress brought his plate out and gave us papertowels from another booth. we couldve donethat... It was just an all around bad experience. ah well you live & learn, right?   note: the ribs @ the rainbow location were just like this too. . good on 1 side and tough on the other end. . .not good. . just plain not good.", "Date": "2011-05-27", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Anne", "ReviewID": "S0j8IsbKoXUZQNYbvLJURQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "AWESOME food, atmosphere and server.

I have had Famous Daves a handful of times in the past and enjoyed the food. I enjoyed it enough to sign up for their email club, and for doing so I received a buy one entree get one free coupon because my birthday is in September. My husband and I decided to use the coupon this past Wednesday evening.  A side note: Contrary to another recently posted review, Famous Daves DOES still have the weekly specials, as of mid-September of 2011. We were offered special pricing on the brisket meal due to it being 'Beef it Up Wednesday'. I was in the mood for ribs though, so I got a combo plate that included ribs and chopped pork.   The last time I had Famous Daves, I remember trying to pick up a rib with a fork and having the meat fall off the bone, it was so tender. This time the ribs were not tender at all, I had to work to get the meat off the bone.  The chopped pork was ok. I prfer pulled pork, but that's just a personal preference. My husband enjoyed the chicken sandwich he ordered, but thought the diablo bbq sauce was weak. I still love the corn bread muffins.   I debated making this a 2 star review because well, I HAVE had better... But at the same time, it wasn't that bad. Our server was decent, friendly enough and pretty efficient.

We waited a long time for our food.  My husband's corn on the cob was ice cold and his cornbread muffin was stale.  I got the brisket sandwich which was terrible.  The sandwich bun was dried out and hard.  There was very little meat on the sandwich, and what little was there was cold and grisly.  I really can't believe they served such a horrible mess.  My husband's ribs were okay although barely room temperature.  We both had beans and fries, which were good.  We then waited forever for the check.

BF and I went in on Friday around 4pm.  We had the onion straws for an appetizer and they were good, buttery taste to them. I liked them better than Lucille's actually.  The remoulade that came with it was so good! He ordered the brisket and the special they had going on, buck a bone which was that you can order up to 6 ribs for a buck a piece to your entree. I ordered the pulled chicken sandwich memphis style with coleslaw on it. My side was the spicy green beans, and his sides were bbq baked beans and garlic mashed potatoes. The brisket for him was disappointing. It was tough, and overcooked it seemed. The waiter gladly let him order something else so he had the pork platter which was just the meat and bread since he already had a full plate.  Waiter's name was Mike, and he was awesome! He let bf take the brisket home. My chicken sandwich was great! The sauce was perfect, the slaw was tasty, green beans were meh...needs more butter or something on them and the bacon needs to be cooked or something.  Overall, it was a great experience!
