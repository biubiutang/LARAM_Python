I ordered the egg rolls, chicken and broccoli and beef and broccoli. I ordered both chicken and beef so I could compare the two proteins and must say I find the beef to be tastier! The egg rolls were more like spring rolls to me..they are small with a delicate, flaky crust...not like the big NY egg rolls I am used to with a thick crust.     I liked how the rice is portioned in containers that are the same size as the entrees; there is nothing worse than getting a carton full of rice that is the size of my pinky. Also, they marked the rice cartons with a little black dash so I don't have to play a guessing game when I go to the refrigerator for left overs...which will happen...many times. The entrees are $9.55 each and are easily three portions!      The only downside was that the onions were a little too undercooked for my liking. I like my onions to be cooked until they are soft...not with a crunch and that pungent raw-onion taste.", "Date": "2015-03-22", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Loan", "ReviewID": "Y3_BQ0tWJA1s5SjeRdwY0w", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Never been disappointed, their customer is good and the food is always consistent.

China Go Go does not splurge on their portions. I felt like I ate half a family dinner. Not a lunch special (served to 4 PM.).   China Go Go features two price ranges for lunch specials. $5.95 and $6.25 for shrimp based entries. Personally, I prefer the pepper steak, shrimp chop suey, and shrimp with lobster sauce.   This is the typical China Go Go experience. Upon ordering from the menu, you pay. If you are drinking a cola, you pick up a cup and serve your self at the cola fountain. The server will deliver your food and plastic utensils. If you are happy with your service, there is a tip jar at the counter.   The lunch special started with noodles and duck sauce. I enjoy thick noodles.   Then, they served me the soup of the day: egg drop soup. This has been the soup of the day at China Go Go everyday for the last three years. My taste buds would enjoy something different, such as won ton or hot and sour soup.   Finally, they served my entree: shrimp chop suey with fried rice and chow mien. The portion could feed two people. The shrimps were giant. No scrimping on quality here. With all the broccoli and mushrooms, I felt like I was eating healthy, instead of pigging out. The fried rice was your average fried rice. I am not crazy over the chow mien. It's like filler on what would be a great album. In all honesty, I prefer Panda Express's Chow Mien.   As I said, China Go Go gives a lot for a lunch special. However, large portions do not guarantee a five star review. I would be a fan if they change their soup of the day or add won ton soup at a reasonable charge, and improve their chow mien, which is served with the meal. I give China Go Go 3 1/2 stars, which is good.  Return factor: high. I appreciated the customer service. If the customer service is great on my next visit, I'll most likely become a fan and up my rating to 4 stars on an updated review.", "Date": "2012-02-04", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jessica", "ReviewID": "Nxk6LoAoT_vklg9eg39MMw", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Before I explain my experience here at China A Go Go, let me tell you about what lead me here (I'm writing the review in the restaurant at this very moment). At around 5:30, I ordered dinner at another close-by Chinese restaurant (check out my reviews to see which one) and at 6pm, I was throwing my order out because it was revolting.  I hopped onto Yelp to write a review and then read some reviews for other Chinese joints.  That's how I found China A Go Go and I'm not disappointed!  I don't typically order honey walnut shrimp, but I did this once after it received many good reviews on Yelp.  I also ordered crab rangoon, my personal favorite at almost all Chinese places.  My order total was around $19, which I guess is the going rate around here...  Anyway, they gave me wonton chips while I waited. They were stale, but who cares?  I didn't come here for that.  Literally within ten minutes, I had both of my food items and they were pipping hot! The crab rangoon pops in your mouth and their sweet & sour sauce is pretty good.  The honey walnut shrimp is a large helping of medium- large sized shrimp that don't taste like they were previously frozen and they are pretty thick.  The sauce, although still not my favorite, isn't too sweet and has somewhat of a tang.  I would order both again and will definitely recommend them to friends.  I am a little disappointed that they do not deliver to my address, but I understand!  I will definitely return!", "Date": "2013-09-10", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Omid", "ReviewID": "204zB4rc_yl3iWFQL2dZIQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Really good food and excellent service.

It was more than enough for two people. In fact, it was enough for our dinner that night AND lunch the next day. The food pretty much tasted like most of the other Chinese fast food joints. My favorites were probably the BBQ Pork fried rice and Egg Flower soup; both very satisfying. The staff were all very friendly and attentive.

Food quality poor, its like they use the worst cuts of beef around for Mongolian Beef & try to pass it off as something edible & pleasing when its clearly not. Fried rice is that of cardboard. Everything is soupy, greasy, and just not appealing at all. If you want MONGOLIAN BEEF SOUP,  this is your place.   Chop Stix is soo much better & up Bermuda at Silverado Ranch.

On my way to the airport the delivery guy called while I was driving, and I explained to him that the order was canceled. Than he goes off about how it takes him more than 30 minutes to drive to my warehouse and that he will never deliver to us again.

This place was terrible! My orange chicken was the worst i have ever had and that's a lot of orange chicken it's one of my favs!

It's not that I don't like it, that's not the case at all, by my manly physique it can go without say that there are very few things I dislike. I'm just not very adventurous in this avenue of dining. There are the things I like and I'm not very open to swaying away from them.  So here's what I've had from China a Go Go - Sweet N Sour Chicken, Lettuce Wraps, Fried Race, pork stuffed Won Tons, General Tsao Chicken, Egg Drop Soup, and Honey Walnut Shrimp. Well, now that I typed out that list I just realized that I might be more versed in Chinese dining than the above paragraph said. Whoops...All of the listed items are outstanding. The Honey Walnut Shrimp is absolutely amazing. The shrimp are  UUUGE  and the sauce is the perfect amount of sweet. The amount of food you get is amazing. The Lettuce Wraps appetizer is enough to feed 4 hungry hippos. Those two items are by far my favorites on the menu.  Here's the biggest thing, and not to stereotype, but I'm going to, I've found that service can sometimes be less than desirable at Chinese restaurants. This place puts the stereotype to rest. For a fast food-ish type restaurant they were very attentive when dining in. Provided refills. Checked on us numerous times. When ordering to go we asked how many crispy won tons you get on the side because we had 4 people eating, they decided to throw in free pork won tons  to make sure everyone has enough food.

Another favorite is the eggplant tofu. It comes covered in sauce but do not be afraid; they've added the perfect amount of seasoning so it's not too salty at all.

This is usually how I rate a good Chinese place. I am a picky eater so I have always ordered mine with no vegetables, rice, chicken, and egg only.

I was leery of the online ordering but it worked just fine. I arrived at the place and my order was ready and best of all it was correct, No Veggies!!

Everyone knows how hard it is to order Chinese food on the phone sometimes because you can't understand each other!  I ordered pot-stickers $5.95, pork fried rice $5.95 and combination kung pao chicken $8.95.  The prices were SO REASONABLE!  My order was $24 with tax and delivery fee.  But I noticed that they have these family meal combos where you get soup, an appetizer, fried rice, white rice and 1 or 2 entrees for a set price that was under $25, or a personal combo package for $9.95.    The delivery took about 40 min, which is typical.  The best part is that the food is FREAKIN' AMAZE balls!  It's some of the best Chinese I've had in Vegas.  The ONLY thing that made me give this 4 stars were the pot stickers.  They were huge and the insides were yummy, but they were slightly undercooked so that the top part dough tasted not completely done.  If they had just been cooked more evenly, these would have been amazing.  As they were, I had to pick off all the dough and just eat the outside and the bottoms.

One order of fried rice and chicken wings should be plenty for two people, or for one dinner and a midnight snack.  TIP: There is plenty of lettuce/garnish/peppers that come with the wings, kind of like a mini salad. It's pretty flavorful and spicy, so I'd recommend saving it with the leftovers and add your own ramen or small bowl of rice. Good for a small snack!

Light, flavorful. These were the opposite. The wrapper was SO thick, it felt like I was chewing on two of them, not just one. And the  shredded veggies  on the inside, were not shredded. They were chopped up and extremely thick, the veggies were hard as well, as though they hadn't been cooked well. It was too much to chew. The  spicy mustard  they gave to me was in a packet and was not hot AT ALL. It was like regular mustard. Yuck.   The mongolian beef was good but again, the slices of beef were enormous! They were not bite sized. They were double and triple bite sized. Definitely do NOT order this on a date because you will look like a velociraptor tearing into his meal. There was a lot of flavor, but also - a LOT of grease. The fried rice that went along with the meal was dry and tasteless. I only ate a couple of bites.

Check your mail for your coupon flyer, then call and enjoy!", "Date": "2013-06-21", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Tony", "ReviewID": "lxJcqR79g_phD8-RysW6Fg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "For no-frills Chinese, I loved it. The food was excellent! Dining in? Meh...paper plates, plastic utensils, but regardless the food is great and there's plenty of it! The Pot Stickers were huge and I got 6 of them, that filled me up alone and they were good. The chicken Fried rice, and General Tsao chicken was fantastic. Even though I ate there, they served all my food in to go containers, so now I have dinner or lunch for several days left over.  Ambiance=0 Service=8 Food=9  It's my take out place from now on.", "Date": "2013-04-21", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Rachel", "ReviewID": "dWa7X-OFfy3k09S92M6fZQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Great experience!   Ordered delivery through Grubhub. Our order arrived early, and we were extremely pleased to find that the restaurant was able to cater to all of our special requests (ie no tofu in the eggplant, no veggies in the chow mein).  All of the food we ordered was delicious. The flavors were all correct and well balanced. My eggplant was cooked perfectly, and I loved the addition of thinly sliced jalapeños that gave it just a little kick. The orange chicken was mild and sweet, perfect for our youngest child. The paper chicken was tender and flavorful.  Also, the kids meals are a terrific value. Huge portion that made 2 meals for my kid.  Can't wait to order again! :)", "Date": "2016-11-11", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Scott", "ReviewID": "vdofKYUFo5PaZxuoOPDPVA", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Horrible, please don't confuse this place with the other locations. China a go go on rainbow is terrific, durango is great too. This place serves their dine in guest with plastic forks and styrofoam bowls, the wor wonton soup here is gross and takes on the taste of plastic its served in. Sliced pork is over sauced and orange chickens really bad last place on earth id eat at....go to a different china a go go please...", "Date": "2015-01-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "George", "ReviewID": "eGERZ2Xp-mEVPdKp8OtzBQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "We were staying at the Oasis RV Park down the road and saw the China a-Go-Go online and decided to give it a go.  Our expectations weren't high, since its a strip mall type setting and a Vegas chain store.  Boy, were we wrong.  Chinese is my favorite meal and I've sampled restaurants all over the country.  This place is outstanding. My wife and I ordered the Mongolian Beef lunches and asked it be made without the hot spice. This was by far the BEST Mongolian beef ever and there was lots of it.  In fact, we had the leftovers for dinner that night.  The noodles are larger than I like, but they were tasty and filling.  Put this place on your 'gotta try' list.", "Date": "2016-11-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "j", "ReviewID": "3nBUh8l2khC-8ehIS70t7g", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I've been to about 3 china a go go's around town and I can definitely say that this location is one of the better ones. It's next to the Von's on windmill and Bermuda, across the street from bachi burger. I came with my husband during his lunch break because I was craving cheap Chinese lunch specials and this location was the closest. We went in and the waitress was kind and told us to sit down anywhere. I was quite impressed that they had booths and looked like a cute little restaurant since most other china a go go's look like only take out locations. There was only one other table but within, no joke, about 10 minutes, the place got packed! They bring you crispy wontons with sweet and sour sauce, and egg drop soup (only for dine in) as you wait for drinks. I ordered the Mongolian beef lunch special for about $6, expecting something small and greasy, assuming you get what you paid for. It comes out in to go boxes and that box was FILLED! My husband and I looked at each other in shock at how much food they give. We could already tell that we weren't gonna be able to finish it. It comes with both chow mein and fried rice and the food was piping hot/fresh. I love Chinese food and I grew up eating authentic Chinese food so if you're looking for that, this place isn't it. But if you're looking for really decent quality Chinese food for dirt cheap, then this is definitely the place to go (especially this location, really clean).", "Date": "2014-05-01", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Antonio", "ReviewID": "w2NNcFjiKITWZkAHQTg6ZA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Always been good food everytime I go.

It's Chinese takeout guys (aka home of the $10 lunch combo)... not an authentic 5 star dining experience.  I order dinner for my family here about once a month.  They always remember me and even throw in some free spring rolls and fried noodles. We haven't gotten sick once despite the other reviews.  Not the greatest but never a complaint...  They deliver a consistent product at a very reasonable price and never had to wait longer than 15 minutes.

Its fast chinese food / take out. but very different from the others..... Ordered delivery. Came on time nice guy. Food was hot lightly packaged old school style in the cool little box . no bulky foam box with dripping plastic bag around it.( thank god) Got veggie chow- mein. Very good! no mystery slime sauce all over it for flavor, just good noodles and a garlicy scent. So good i actually thought i was eating chicken lol.. but i wasnt.  Really like the little container of ORANGE sauce.

We ordered 3 entrees, Mongolian beef-very good and right spicy, kung pao chicken-good, and honey walnut shrimp-to die for. Also, I said I had a coupon but didn't, they needed to actually have the coupon, since I didn't have a coupon,they gave us free wontons, which were really good. Thanks!

I ordered the lunch special ($5.95) with Spicy Garlic Chicken with came with Chow Mein and Fried Rice. Apparently, if you eat in, you get a cup of the soup of the day, which is cool, but I took it out.  The food was alright, nothing to write home about, but not bad either! The Spicy Garlic Chicken wasn't really spicy at all and struck me as being more sweet than anything else.   It was a minor thing, but I asked for no vegetables and there were TONS of veggies in the Chow Mein...perhaps it's pre-cooked that way and heated up. In any case, I ate around the veggies :)  Really not a bad place for a cheap bite to eat!", "Date": "2012-09-27", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
