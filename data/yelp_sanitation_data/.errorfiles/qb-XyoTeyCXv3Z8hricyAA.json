It was a Thursday night and I was helping to celebrate a friends Bachelor party and I had no clue we were going to an actual club, the night started at the MGM where 2 of us were meeting the rest of the group and when we did we got word that one of the group members from out of state that happens to be a very successful business owner from Houston was on his way in the Goliath Limo to pick us up. As far as I had been told we were hitting a bar or 2 and getting some drinks and playing it cool. Well that was not what our friend had planned.   First stop, Moon. Keep in mind I was in Blue jeans, a black T-shirt and my chuck Taylor's, as I was standing at the booth downstairs I mentioned to our friend that the two of us that were not dressed up would go play tables and wait for the rest of the guys to come out. That is when I realized how money driven Las Vegas really is. Our friend talked the guy at the door payed for VIP and the guard stamped my hand and stopped the other line and lead us to our Booth on the patio/moon deck. I have to say I was still shocked that I was in the club in my street clothes and because of the money spent the security guards hung at our booth and brought groups of ladies to the bachelor and offered to get rid of them and get a new group if necessary.   Not only was the security awesome, the music was spot on and mixed very very well, the waitress was awesome, she kept our drinks full all night and never made a pass by our table without checking on the entire group. All of the staff was amazing and took very good care of us and made sure we had a great time until we departed for our next destination.", "Date": "2011-06-17", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Kim", "ReviewID": "BNRnRKMdXNp2dYXm4CCgoQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "All i can say about this club aside from the other reviews, is that I loved the view...They have a balcony that overlooks the strip.

Once they opened their doors, the Ghostbar cleared out and eventually closed early.  We made our way over to Moon with all of the other club goers, and this is what I found to be the high and low lights:  The good: - Staff are amazing.  Very friendly and fun! - Like Ghostbar, great view of the city. - A decent sized dance floor.  The bad: -The same drink that I had just got at Ghostbar was $2 more at Moon. -The music selection was okay, but the sound system was in need of a lot of adjustment.  The bass was too heavy for a lot of songs, and my wife wanted to leave because the music sounded so bad.  I prefer the more casual ambiance and vibe of Ghostbar over Moon.  Moon is a more traditional looking club, but the music just killed the experience for us.

If you are able to score or pull a group together to share in the bottle service, do it on a nice warm night and ask for the outside tables.

Now that I'm on Yelp, thought I would write a review on it :)   - Right off the bat, I wasn't a fan of taking an elevator up to a club, considering there were hordes of people waiting to get in. It helped that we had a connection that evening.  Well, it was THE night for Hef's 81st birthday so that pretty much explained the extremely long line. - First, we were taken to the Playboy club which allowed party goers to mingle, grab a few drinks or gamble at the tables hosted by yours truly, Playboy dealers.  - Drinks were pricey but that's expected. To begin the evening, the bachelor (that's me) bought a round of 120 proof burbon shots for the crew. Result? One of my buddies, who doesn't really drink decided he wanted in but I did offer him a broken down golf cart LOL What a mistake! He called it a night before we even made it up to Moon. - Of course, there was Hef along with the original  Girls Next Door  in a booth and I had the opportunity to talk to Kendra for a few minutes after she found out I was getting married the following month. In her words,  Are you sure????  LOL nice. Then it was time for everyone to make their way to Moon nightclub. - A definite upgrade from Rain nightclub the night before. I'll admit, I was impressed with the decor and layout. What probably impressed me the most of the view from the outdoor patio, providing a stunning view of Las Vegas. Later that evening, the roof opened up, a beam of white light shined upon us and next thing you know we're in an alien ship! LOL  - Obviously, Hollywood graced their presence in the club. Not surprising, Paris and her rendition of a stripper along with a friend and a pole. I've seen better.......dances LOL - Girl/Guy ratio that evening? All I remember seeing were 20-30 ladies dancing a top the VIP booths going nuts! It was INSANE in there. I remember one guy who tried to blend himself in with the ladies, eventually found himself being grabbed by bouncers after refusing to come down. What made it worse, they ripped his shirt.  - Music was at the top of its game, a blend of hiphop, r&b, electro and top hits. - At one point in the night, the entire club took a 10 minute break while they sang  happy birthday  to Hef.   Overall, a great time at Moon nightclub.

Best of all, your entry is also good for Playboy, which is down stairs via escalator and Ghostbar. I think it may be good also at Rain, but haven't tried there yet. That's good value.

Fast forward to now and some good promoter-friends, we skipped the line and were shown to the elevator right away.   And what an elevator ride it was! My ears popped about halfway up, I could hear the eardrum shattering bass before the doors even opened and within seconds we were already dancing our way out of the elevator and into the biggest logjam of people trying to get out of the club and back down said elevators. I encountered this same problem later in the evening when I was tired, had aching feet and just wanted to go stand in the 30 minute cab line to get  home .   The club itself is pretty small compared to places like Tao and Rain, and the dance floor was extremely packed. The floor lit up, which I found entertaining for a few minutes.   The view from one of the balconies is what really made this place special as it looks over the entire Vegas strip from afar. I also hear the roof retracts but we did not witness this event the day that we came.   Overall, Moon was just OK and definitely did not live up to the hype generated by the choosey doorman goons downstairs.

They played a bunch of house, forever. I usually like house, but I guess I have a threshold for the onslaught of douchebaggery that results.  The club set-up was nice though.

I came on a Friday night and it was pretty much dead to a light crowd, very disappointing.   The dual levels was nice. The first level is a lounge while the second level is the club. The elevators, rainbow light escalators, and staff were all helpful when getting around. The bartenders as well as security guards were also very helpful, if you ever have a question just ask any one of them and they'll answer you with a smile.   The layout was great, it has a large dance floor and free outdoor seating that had a surrounding view of The Strip, the view continued even when you went back into the club through the tall glass windows. But of course in the Winter having free seating only outside isn't ideal.  The bathrooms were nice and clean, but the lighting was way too dark to check yourself or apply makeup or anything like that. I understand if the lighting is super dark inside the club, but the bathrooms too, really?  I ordered 1 AMF, which cost me $16. Holy s***. Given that, it was the best AMF I have ever had and the bartender gave me the largest smile I've ever seen, so I did tip him despite the already outrageous price.  The music was pretty bad since the DJ's repeated a lot of songs. That's a huge no-no, everyone knows that. They mainly played hip hop, hardly any mix of electronic too. Thought that would be helpful for the electronic fans out there. If you like electronic music head to Hakkasan.

Just keep the card they give you and make sure your stamp doesn't rub off.   We went to Moon after going to the Playboy Club. Moon and the Playboy Club are connected so it's very easy to maneuver between both clubs. While the Playboy Club has more of a loungey feel while Moon is a dance club.   By the time that we got to Moon it was impossibly full and really, really, hard to move around. I swear I do not know how the Fire Marshall in Las Vegas allows these clubs to have so many people in them? This club was so crowded it kind of ruined the overall experience because it took a long time to move around. Literally everywhere my bachelorette party went it was bumper to bumper people.   Despite the crowd, the best thing about Moon is the music. There was an awesome DJ that rocked my world. Well, he was rocking my world until the  peeing  incident. My girlfriends and I were dancing and this guy next to us pulls out his  thing  and starts peeing on the dance floor. Yes, I said peeing and yes, I said  thing.  I have never been so disgusted in my entire life! One of my girlfriends got splashed and as you can imagine it was not pleasant. People had thought a drink spilled and so they were dancing in pee. I wanted badly to get a security guard's attention but I could barely move. My girlfriends and I left after that as who wants to stay in a place after that?

(how many people have used the word nook in a review? i think i may be the first. it is, in fact, the perfect word for where the tables are placed.) so you get to mingle with some other party goers. it just so happened that the table next to us that night housed a group of gorgeous women. no problems there.   furthermore the service is top notch. we were escorted everywhere we went. the hostess poured our drinks the whole night (although i had to top mine off with a biiiiit more alcohol, i thought it was a nice gesture). our hostess even came by and danced with me at the table when my group went to check out the playboy club and i stuck around to drink with our neighbors. how many other hostesses at other clubs would do that? the answer is zero. so yeah, great service.  all in all moon provided a perfect venue for a last night in vegas.

I was in Vegas for the first time for my cousins bachelor party (don't ask for any more details than I post here because that would be violating Section 7 Paragraph 2 of the Man Code), and we had the penthouse suite at the Palms.  With a room like that booked we naturally had no problem in aquiring a table at the Moon bar.  I had no idea what to expect, seriously this place was just what the Dr. ordered.  I LOVED this place.  Maybe it was because of the artful layout, the incredible view, the service (hey you order 8 bottles at a VIP table your getting the good treatment),  the fact that I could stand with a scotch in one hand and a Cohiba cigar in the other and not be forced outside like some hyperactive leper, or the aforementioned 8 bottles of top shelf liquor.  Just to mention the level of service you get in this place.  Upon entering the bar we were shown to our upstairs table, I immediatly had to use the gentleman's room.  Now its dark in this place, and I am near special olympics drunk.  I asked the bar back by the table where the can was, probably noticing the look of urgency on my face he turned on his little flashlight and told me to follow him.  Thank what ever diety you pray to for this guy, not only did he show me where the bathroom was, he plowed through everyone clearing a lane for me on the way there.  I would have never made it if it weren't for that guy.  Oh and I almost forgot when, later in the night when I lost the ability to control the volume of my voice or the rampant nonsense that comes out of it, I remarked that there were definatly not enough women at the table (there were 7, and I was being sarcastic I thought), the same bar back hears this, dissapears only to return what seemed like 20 min later with 3 random girls he found downstairs.  Although I had been kidding, you got to give this guy an A for effort and an A for customer service. He definatly earned the $100 i gave him.....lol.  Ok bathroom humor aside.  This place was a blast, awesome music, the other patrons were suprisingly friendly and sociable with everyone around them (was expecting this to be the place that you tend to socialize only with the group your with).  I highly recommed this place to anyone and everyone, though I do suggest calling ahead and reserving a table with bottle service as it looked like the bars were perpetually packed.

You're welcome.  After hitting up Mix and Ghostbar, which should have been named  Ghost Town,  on 1/27/11, my newly 21 year old sister, me, Jen S. and Amy hit up Moon. There was a total of... not a single soul in line. After chatting with the guy who put us on the elevator, telling us he hadn't been to a club in two years, even though he works for one, we were inside the club.  It's small in here. Not as small as that POS Eve, or Lolitas, but the actual dance floor is a bit bigger than Tryst, without all the tables and stripper poles. What makes it nice? The balcony, which is even higher than the one next door at Ghostbar.   So we walk in and out the blue, Jen finds a group of three British friends - James C., Ross and Sean. 5 seconds in, she's already taking pictures with them. So random. I thought she knew them, but apparently not. The super good looking one in the group, Sean, started mackin' on some random Russian chick after all of us girls went to check out the gorgeous view from the balcony.  Well, somehow, we were unable to shake the two guys from  the trio of friends from south west England traveling the globe after graduating University.   Do I believe it? Ummm... no. They're probably living in North Las Vegas or some bs. Who knows, who cares?  Oh Gawd. So I was chatting it up with this guy James, who looks a whole lot like an older (22) British version of Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and his weirdo friend Ross comes up and starts dancing with me. EWWW. I'm talking major nasty. First of all, he's so drunk that the idea of personal boundaries has not even entered his mind. Secondly, I don't know if he hallucinated that we knew each other and that I said it was okay for him to get all gross up on me, but I didn't and it's not okay. After ignoring this guy, pushing his hands off me, moving across the dance floor and telling him  no  a zillion times, James came to my rescue and told Ross to beat it. Thank God. I thought I was saved for the night. I was sorely mistaken.  After getting hyphy to Edward Maya's  Stereo Love  - club mix (This is the only House/Techno/w/e the hell genre this song is apart of, that I love and can stand.) that weirdo Ross came back up to me, ignoring my general disgust and zero interest in him. As my sister said, he looked like he should have been either a founder of Ben & Jerry's or working for  Life is Good.  He looked like a grosso hippy that should be smokin' at UC Santa Cruz or Humboldt State. Over the bleh music, James saved me again and offered to get me a drink. Thanks, but no thanks. I have rules people - no accepting free drinks from guys! At this point, Amy had left, so my sister and Jen were bought drinks, which was fine with me.   The music was kinda not that great. For every one good song, there were like, 5 bad songs. Some guy kept asking me if I was having a good time then would segue into harassing me to dance with him. I told him I couldn't dance to such bad music so, lo siento compadre, or as my sister said,  Beat it, Seal.  (Seal as in the singer, not the furry kind that get made into coats.)  We all took a break out on the balcony, mainly so I could get away from Ross. Some couple came up to me and Jen and asked what the best club to go to was.  Is it XS? What about Tryst?  Ummmm.... NONE OF THE ABOVE. We all took pictures and chilled outside for a bit. The weather was perfect, as was the view. Tons of space to sit and relax. Unfortunately I can see this place being a major sardine can in the summer - smelly, cramped and greasy.  Finally some good music came on and we all went back in to dance. There were some people gettin' major crazy. There was a few bachelorette parties there and they were either dancing like elephants on the tops of the booths, or making out like they were trying out for a part in Starz' Spartacus. It was kinda gross. One chick who was dressed like a ho with a veil, and was sucking the life out of some guy she was making out with, had a thigh the size of my torso. :-/   Averting my eyes, I saw that creep who couldn't keep his hands to himself - Ross. AGAIN. GAWD. GO AWAY! I told James that if Ross was going to come near me one more time, I was kissing him (James) in front of him so he'd (Ross) would get the hint and leave me the eff alone. 5 seconds later I was planting a very closed mouthed kiss on James - it worked! I didn't see that creeper at all since then.   The night got progressively more boring as the guys got drunker, I got tired and the music got worse. I tried to find the exit to only by pass them multiple times. Yeah, the exit elevators are across from the main bar. The bouncer made us wait forever behind some ropes just so we could leave.

The DJ played a solid blend of house, rap, pop, and top-40. If you like variety, then you'll definitely enjoy Moon.  3. The space. Even on NYE, I didn't find this place to be overwhelmingly packed. Getting to the bathrooms, bar, or outdoor deck wasn't the usual excruciating process.  4. The bartenders. The bartenders were dishing out drinks at an incredible pace. Even with only a few minutes till midnight (NYE), I was able to grab a few drinks and find my group in time to celebrate.  5. The vibe. Less pretense than at some of the larger clubs. Friendly, down to earth atmosphere.  6. The elevators. No need to hike up or down any stairs.  Since Moon is located at the Palms, you'll need to take a cab if you're staying on the strip.

My friend was in town for the night and we couldn't decide what club to go to, if any...then lo and behold - we got free V.I.P to The Palms (Rain, Moon, Playboy, & Ghostbar) While I was pretty disappointed in the club, it was best of the three we visited (we didn't try Ghostbar - the lines to get in these places were horrific, even with  V.I.P  - which I'm pretty sure every female walking the strip got that day...which would explain waiting in line for 30-45 minutes to get in)  The music was a mix of Top 40 stuff and the D.J. wasn't bad. There were some songs that you couldn't really dance to, but not bad altogether. The dance floor was packed...as was almost every other section of floor space in the club. Navigating was a little difficult as people were unwilling to move so you could get past them. Maybe it was the fact that they were too involved with groping each other...or too busy watching other people grope on each other (yeah, there were some creepy guys there.)  Although there are two bars in Moon, one by the front and one near the outside balcony, it took a bit to get a drink. A little less time for us girls...but a wait none the less; especially with other girls trying to flirt with the bartenders and the bartenders trying to ignore yet engage them (it's all about the tips ya know.) At least that was fun to watch while we waited to order our drinks. The drinks were a little cheaper at the Palms than most places...but really I'm paying $10 for a cranberry juice with a splash of vodka. The drinks are WEAK. Maybe the drinks were so expensive and watered down because they're in real glass - which makes them fancier...although Glass + Drunk dancing = EPIC FAIL!  There is a small balcony that looks over some of Vegas, which is pretty...but there is minimal room outside and the crowd was eh...most of the people outside had the VIP tables, so I guess they felt  elite .

I actually went there last night for a friend's bachelor party. And before that I was there at a table with some friends during Memorial Weekend. This club has one of the best views of the strip, since it is on the top floor of the Palms Casino and is off the strip. It is called Moon since it has a balcony facing the east side with views of the I-15 expressway and the strip. The main dance floor actually has a roof that opens up as well adding to why the club is called Moon.  This club is one of the few that is open on Sundays and Tuesdays. The music is a great mix of house meshed with top 40 and every DJ I've seen here occasionally drops in some fan favorite hip hop/rap songs.   Last night I was at a table right next to the dance floor and DJ and it was an excellent spot. The table had a raised spot and there was a go go dancer directly behind us. There was also a higher spot at the same level as the go go dancer where we sat and chilled by our table. The last time I was here I saw ladies on top of that platform dancing and holding onto a railing, which also would give guys perks and plenty of eye candy for what they would want to see in a club. The club was kept clean, the servers, bussers, boucers, and hosts were friendly and on point.   This is one of the older clubs, hence why I gave it 4 stars but I believe I heard the entire casino is going for a huge remodeling and this may also include the nightclubs.

This club is smaller and more upscale, with great views of the strip from the 52nd or 53rd floor. Music on the Sat night we went was mostly hip hop. It was not as packed as other clubs like XS or Tao, yet filled with enough people to make it exciting. There is a smaller room called  Satellite Bar  which was empty, an outside area, and a small dance floor. Everyone in the club was dancing when we were there, including people at the bar and waiting for the elevators. Great vibe. Moon felt very trendy and  just right.  We tried out some other clubs after going to Moon but ended up heading back.  An added tip: they are strict with any girls taking their shoes off, even for a second to rest your feet (they will kick you out).

Although it's a less common choice to make, I hope to enlighten anyone who is contemplating it.  Let me preface my review with a little background info, I have been to several of the big name clubs in LV (JET, LAX, Body English to name a few) and have gotten a bottle service or two in my day both in Vegas as well as Chicago so I would like to think I have some frame of reference with which to judge my experience.  My most recent trip to Moon a group of 6 of us went on a Tuesday (locals night at moon) for bottle service. The minimum for a group of 6 is 2 bottles, you get the table all night and you are not required to purchase additional bottles to remain at the table (this is not the case at other Vegas clubs). The bottles run anywhere from $450 and up, and if available the bottle is 1L in size not 750mL. An additional 20% gratuity is automatically added to the bill. To make the reservation, they require you to fill out and sign a form, then fax it along with a copy of your license and credit card.   I had requested a table out on the balcony (yes you can request it, although they cannot guarantee it, you are very likely to have your request accomidated) , provided the weather is supposed to be good I highly recommend you do the same.   Be aware of your shoes and shirt. While they are more lax with the dress code when you have a table, you should still be dressed appropriately or risk being turned away.  Table guests are required to check in by 10:30 (when the club is scheduled to open), there is a separate line for table reservations so you do not have to wait long if at all. Once checked in you are greeted by a VIP host who makes small talk and explains the club as you are whisked past the line (no cover), and up to the club on the 56th floor (if they don't give you their card, ask for it, VIP hosts are good people to know, their cell phone numbers are on the card and they are very accomodating since its their job). Try to remember to tip the VIP host as well once you get to the table, $40 is reasonable and if you are planning to use them as a connection in the future they are far more receptive to scratch your back if you scratch theirs.  Once arrived at the table, the VIP host introduces you to your waitress and your security detail (yes you get a bouncer). The waitress then asks you to choose what you wish to order off the menu and introduces you to your bottle runner. I chose a bottle of EFFEN black cherry (fantastic vodka and rare to find in a club) and a bottle of Kettle One. Each bottle was 475 if I remember correctly.  I appreciated that 5 cans of red bull were included with the price, as many other clubs do not include any. Beyond that they were 5$ each additional can. Note: Red Bull is a sponsor of Moon so they have 'Red Bull Cola', may not sound great, but it is and it makes a great mixer, I have never seen it anywhere else.  Additionally, I like that the tables are actually booths, quite spacious ones at that, we had no problem fitting 5 into it and a chair was brought over to us for our 6th. Other clubs the tables are only 1/2 booths, are often very crowded together, and nearly impossible to fit anymore than 4 people around comfortably.  The bottom line is the service was impeccable, from the VIP host to the bouncer, everyone was on top of their game and really was helpful. It also doesn't hurt that by my measure Moon has the hottest cocktail waitresses in Vegas. The prices are on par with any other high caliber club in LV, except the table is yours for the night guaranteed.   The crowd is actually quite good, it was extremely busy for a Tuesday (its actually one of the best days to go) and there were plenty of attractive people walking around. Table service gets you noticed, and being out on the balcony ensures you get noticed by EVERYONE. The incredible view basically ensures that everyone will be outside to see it at least once, and will subsequently walk by your table.  Let's put it this way, my experience at Moon was so good I have already booked my next Vegas trip in August and I have a table booked at Moon back to back nights (Fri, Sat).

The dance floor is in the middle of the club and there are tables all around it.

Moon also has a second floor with another bar and another patio access. I had a great time there. But this is one of those places you probably want to get a table for.

Fast forward to getting into the club. We had bottle service because it was our friend's birthday. 0ur host was so nice, but he was from San Francisco and us being from the Bay...well, we all connected.   We waited in line for about three minutes, while another bouncer checked ID's and then headed into the elevator straight up to Moon. The birthday boy played  Get 0utta Your Mind  on his phone on the ride up and our new host friend was singing along too. The bass was so loud when we reached the club, it hyped us up even more.  We were taken to a smaller room off to the side for our table. It was REALLY nice that we were in that room because we tried going in the main room and it was jam packed! There's probably ten tables in the room total, there's a dance floor and a bar in the room...just for the people in there. If you go to Moon, I'd definitely request a table in that room because you can go between there and the main room.  The hostess was really attentive, always kept our cups full. They gave us complimentary shots of Jager. 0ur host at the beginning of the night came up after a couple hours and made sure that we were enjoying ourselves.  Baby Bash did a surprise performance the night we went. Another Bay Area native, all the boys went and met him...the girls stayed back at the table and danced.   Like other people have said...don't leave when everyone else does, it's a pain. Not only are you dealing with Moon, but you're dealing with people from Playboy, Rain and Ghostbar. Not cool, especially when you're drunk. But I found a limo within five seconds of looking at the horrendous taxi line and convinced our group that it was worth it.

The place is a bit smaller than most of the Vegas club monstrosities which I enjoyed. Packed, but not slammed, you'll have plenty of chances to rub bodies with the hotties but get some air when you need it. With a bit of an industrial vibe, Moon is surprisingly conservative on outrageous decor and scintillating go-go dancers. Apparently the gyrating crowd should be enough to titillate you... it worked for me. I danced the night away in my Gucci heels and prerequisite sequin dress and rubbed elbows with locals, European Polo players, floozies and Playboy bunnies. Don't miss the fabulous (and large) outdoor balcony where the party continues high atop the strip with views for days.  The one caveat here (and star retraction) is the lack of bar real estate. One smallish bar near the front entrance of the club and that's it.

Good in theory, but because the 2nd floor of the club is VIP-only, the regular folks get the poor-man's view.  Boo-hiss!   I also had an issue with the music.  It was SO gangster.  I'm a hip-hop fan, too, but honestly, this was pretty hardcore.  It didn't have a great beat, was hard to dance to (especially when you've landed a cute Navy cop!) and didn't exactly have the crowd going crazy.  When the DJ switched to Tupac and Snoop, things took a turn for the better!  Finally, the clientele isn't the greatest.

Not bad I guess. Ride an elevator to the top, walk through Playboy casino room. There's 2 stories and outside balconies. Very nice view. The open the moon roof occasionally. Came here for a friend's birthday, so we had a few rounds. Drinks are kind of expensive. $11 a shot. I bought 7 drinks, came out to $73 + tip. Drinks aren't very strong, I didn't really get a buzz after 3 rounds. The music is okay, they play a lot of  rock  music, which I like, but a bit too much, and the transitions between different types aren't very good. They didn't play Usher or Chris Brown, but played lots of Kanye West! The crowd kind of sucks. Hence the lower rating. Lots of guys, and the few girls usually are taken. The crowd is a bit  older . The go-go dancers are nice, but there are lot of girls that dance on the chairs that shouldn't be dancing!

The bathrooms are superb as well, and fully stocked with cologne, cigarettes, cigars, and a just as jaw-dropping view of the strip.  (Go for the urinal by the window...its got the best view).

The dance floor is not spectacular and the general layout is surprisingly pedestrian for Vegas standards. Its attempt at creating a  space  theme doesn't go the full Sci-Fi length (I'm sure purposefully) but at the same time I personally like consistency in my themes. This can be found at several other Vegas nightclubs such Pure or Tao. In many instances I felt like Moon didn't really have a distinct personality. The music was standard, as was the DJ. The reserved tables were also a bit precariously placed. They were literally on the dance floor. Sure, I see the advantage of having tables right near the dance floors but I've always enjoyed a little space between the dancers and the sitters.

Unfortunately, I still find myself frequenting the clubs from time to time and just tell myself that 30s are the new 20s.  Yeah, whatever.  So the view is really gorgeous, as stated in everyone's reviews.  My friend's co-worker had a host at the Palms, so we were able to get a VIP table--or maybe all tables are VIP?  Anyways, I have to say that what I enjoyed the most was eat being able to walk past the long line without having to wait to get into the damn club.  There was a two-bottle minimum for our table.  Since we only had four people, we pretty much had one bottle left over.  However, since my friend and I were staying at the Palms, we were able to take it back to our room---one of the bouncers had to escort us carrying the bottle himself and we were able to go down in a different private elevator.  The crowd seemed like your average Vegas bunch---half naked women and drunk men.  Music was okay.  I don't recall the ceiling over the dancefloor ever retracting, though.  The place is pretty big, including an upstairs and two balconies.  The waitresses are pretty hot as well--it was kinda weird having them pour all our drinks for us and stand over our table every so often.  Talk about service....every time our bucket was slightly empty, some guy would refill it...whenever we finished our drink, someone would immediately take the empty glass away and clean the table...the carafes of cranberry and orange juice wouldn't even be 1/2 empty and they'd take it away only to replace it with a full one.  Man, I could get used to going VIP.  I have no idea how much it all cost bc someone else took care of the bill, thank God, but I'm sure it was near $1000 w/ tip if one bottle of Grey Goose is $475.

You can catch the escalator going down and that will pop you right into the Playboy Club, which is a whole different review in itself.  Update! 03/05/08 - Experienced bottle service the past Saturday and had a little section right next to the deejay booth.  They really keep the mixers (fresh OJ, cranberry juice, Coke and Sprite), ice bucket, and glasses replenished the whole time.  Not once did we have to ask them for anything.  And just as I was about to make myself another drink, the cocktail girl would come by and do it for me.  (After I told her my drink the first time, she always remembered.)  There were also two guys that came along checking on things, cleaning up glasses, wiping stuff down, checking the floors, etc.  They are damn good about keeping you happy with your bottle service!

Best seat, beautiful view, man it just didn't get any better than that! We had drinks coming left and right while the servers would continuously flirt with all the boys.  Being the only girl in the group, it was really interesting to see a lot of girls just scheming to get free drinks from our table. I didn't find it necessary to dance on the actual dance floor since I had the luxury to just dance in my own booth on top of the chairs.  Good times!  The fact that we had VIP, I had a blast!!!!

Moon is unique in so many ways. First, it sits atop the 53rd floor of the Fantasy Tower of the Palms, giving you an unprecedented view of the strip. Second, I like the fact that it's not a mega club [read: PURE, Tao, and XS], while those clubs are fun, this is definitely more laid back and little more intimate. Finally, they have a retractable roof, an amazing light system, a spectacular layout ... I just can't say enough about this place! Onto the semantics ...  Because the Palms casino floor is fairly small, you will find the huge sign reading FANTASY TOWER very easily. Moon is open Tuesday, and Thursday - Sunday @ 10.30. If you arrive before 10.30, your express elevator will take you up to the Playboy club first (yes, the two are connected, more on that later, and see a separate review for Playboy). If this is the case, Moon is accessible via a set of escalators within Playboy (and yes, you can go back and forth throughout the evening).   Virtual Walkthrough: Moon has a somewhat simple, but oh-so-amazing layout. If you arrive from the elevators, remember your bearings, because you'll need to take these same elevators 53 stories down. Directly in front of you is the main bar, with a design made completely out of hexagons. To the left of the bar is an additional room dubbed the  satellite bar  and depending on how busy it is, it may or may not be open. To your left, down the hallway of the elevators  you just stepped off of are the bathrooms. To the right, you'll find the main room. Dance floor is in the center, walkway is around which makes the club easy to navigate. At the far end, you'll find a bar. There are two doors that lead to the balcony with the amazing views of the strips. Right besides these doors are two staircases that lead to the upper level of the club. Up here [the space is somewhat limited], there is an additional bar, tables, and access to another [smaller balcony].   Why I love Moon: besides the aforementioned reasons, it's a great place to party. The crowd is younger [as with the Palms in general] and the music is always bumping. The bartenders are always friendly, and generous on their pours, and the glasses may be a bit smaller than usual, but there's a lot of booze in there, and the prices aren't too bad [compared to other places]. I like how you can to and from Playboy at your leisure, and the retractable roofs, and fog and light effects top it all off. Additionally, the club has a great layout that is easy to navigate if you want to avoid the traffic of the dance floor.   Note upon exiting: With only 2 express elevators servicing Playboy and Moon, lines can build up. There is normally a queue in the room of the main bar, and a bouncer making sure no one cuts in line. Be prepared for a short wait if exiting during peak hours (2-3am).  VEGAS ADVICE: Try to get free passes to the clubs; they honor them 99% of the time. I have never once paid to get into Moon/Playboy. Ask your hotels concierge, or find people on the strip trying to  sell  the passes; it can save you up to $40 on weekends.   Bottom Line: Nothing beats partying 53 stories above Vegas in a hotel that is notorious for their clubs, parties, and sky villas. Moon is unlike any other vegas club, and the overall atmosphere does not disappoint. And, most likely, when exiting, you will be given an  All Access Pass  that allows you into all the Palms nightclubs - 4 for 1 deal isn't so bad is it?", "Date": "2009-01-14", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Dawn", "ReviewID": "_OiN1lHpVV9XcYJlEtOEzQ", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Uh, are we in Moon? So went the rest of the night...   Upon touching down in MacLaren airport, we did a quick change at the hotel and took a cab over to Moon/Playboy. Upon arrival, our friends who had set up the logistics for the evening had told us to go to the front and tell the person that we were on ***'s guest list. However, the guest list was a joke. Sent back and forth between the desk and the guy with the clipboard at the line, no one could figure out who we supposed to be listed under even though the snobby guy at the desk finally said  ooohhh, ****  (pronouncing the name in a different way - WTF??). Some how we got in, and were directed to the carding line which also doubled as the elevator line. When the elevator doors flew open, the usher-type guy barked at us to get in the elevator. Nice customer service jerk-o.   When we got out of the elevator, the walkway opened up to gambling tables on the left and right sides and then a dance floor in the middle. I had never seen card and roulette tables inside a club before so I thought this was super cool; something for the wall flowers to do while others drank and danced. Unfortunately we thought Playboy was Moon (my bad) and spent about 15 minutes looking for the rest of our group. We discovered some escalators in a discreet corner by accident and took them up only to discover another club upstairs. Man, we were such noobs!  The atmosphere at Moon was much more club-like. The place was filled with a packed bar on the right, a packed dance floor in the middle, and lots of not so hot ladies dancing with the poles above the reserved tables. I was grossed out by the icky guys gawking.   At the bar, the drinks were great and the bartenders speedy. However they claimed that the credit card machine not working (BS!!) when we tried to pay for our drinks. Everyone was quickly drained of all cash, which quickly put an end to our carousing at Moon.   The DJ spun a pretty good hip hop mix of old and new stuff. I prefer a little bit more variation, so i took a lot of breaks when the newer stuff came on.   Around midnight, the roof opened up. While this presto-chango seemed cool for a moment, the open air made me realize how gimmicky it all was because the room became hella hot and humid from the outside Vegas air. I kind of expect to be constantly bombarded with AC when I'm in Vegas because it's so damn hot.   Pushing through the sweaty madness, we continued dancing. The dance floor seemed to just get more crowded and the drunk people began to walk into us more and more. Getting annoyed at the rude drunk people and tiring of the humidity, we retreated downstairs to soak up the AC. The dance floor was dead around 130a so we snapped a bunch of pictures to capture our first night in Vegas and decided to get some grub.   The exit was a bit of a wait because we had to wait for the elevators. Thus the night ended as convoluted as it began. Waiting in a long-ass line to get out, getting confused about which way to go, getting into another line to take a cab back, sweating to death in the Vegas night air. All in all, a decent first night out.", "Date": "2009-08-09", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Shelby", "ReviewID": "sfurV_sqk1lp809xL0tDNA", "Overall": "1", "Content": "The absolute worst  resort  possible in Vegas.

The  security  we were directed to to help find it was no where to be found and took over 20 minutes to even ask what we had lost, he couldn't have been any more disinterested in finding the ID.         After coming back to the hotel the next to give them more time to find the ID they had decided to charge another $1200 to the credit card on file from the night before. We were no longer even in Vegas when the charge was made, we immediately called the hotel to find out who had made the charge and were told accounting is closed and there was nothing they could do, no one in there right mind would be OK with that answer after being charged so much money for absolutely no reason.

BUT this is honestly one of the BETTER/BEST clubs I've been to in Las Vegas.   For the VIP booth we got a bottle of Jack Daniels and Kettle One vodka. There's a really big selection of alcohol to choose from, which is really nice. They give you a plethora of juices, sodas, and lemons and limes for our drinks.   Since we had a booth, we pretty much had our own dance floor because we were allowed to dance on the stage surrounding our booth. Oh, there's also a little pole for our enjoyment as well. ;) So instead of dancing with nasty, sweaty, gross guys, we got to dance with our group of friends.   The staff assigned to our table were really, very attentive. John was THE BEST guy to get. He's amazing, and made sure I had THE BEST time for my birthday. I got two shots of patron on the house. ;)  The bar tenders were also amazing. We ordered a bunch of shots and let me tell you, these weren't shots but more like drinks in themselves. FUCK YEAH! And they were strong!   Honestly though, if you're celebrating a birthday, go to Moon at the Palms. It'll be a night you'll never forget. Well, you might forget because you'll be drunk.

The dance floor is cool because the ceiling is open...hence the name Moon Nightclub, but there was no Moon tonight...so I guess we could have called the bar Sky.  The bartender here was the most amazing bartender ever.  She told me her name something with a K in the beginning.  She knew how to rock out drinks like a pro.  The bar was completely packed and she took 5 different drink orders at once and then proceeded to fill each one without asking anyone to repeat themsleves and some people had 4 drinks in there order.  What impressed me was I ordered a Kettle and Tonic and she remembered I previously ordered a Lemon wedge in it.  No bartender ever remembers that...they always throw a lime wedge in there even if I ask for a lemon when I order it.  Just amazing to watch her bang out drinks and keep the customers happy!  The drinks were also free because of the private party, so I have no idea of how much it would cost to really go here.  Men's Bathroom has a great view too...they installed a nice big floor to ceiling window in there.

The Playboy Club is one level below Moon and I met Matthew...a really big tall Hawaiian Guy and he let me in to check it out.  Very nice guy but you would not want to be on his bad side.  The Club seemed like a place to just drink and gamble.  Hef was there a couple of days ago.

Very nice, but we didn't really get to enjoy it for long because it was raining and they closed it off at a certain time. The setup is pretty nice and the music was ok. It is me or do most Vegas clubs go from hip hop to rock to hip hop to electronica (house/trance)? I go to clubs to listen to hip hop and rap and that top 40 stuff, not rock or electronica, although I don't mind them...If I wanna listen to house or trance I'll go to a rave not a club. Everyone seems to enjoy it, but when they play that rock stuff, I'll just go smoke, go to the bathroom, or grab a drink.

The girls still had to pay $20 & the guys had to pay $40.  This was the only time that we ladies had to pay during the whole trip.

The wait for drinks wasn't bad, and the prices are what I expected for Vegas...but the same drink that was $13 here was only $10 at Ghostbar.    A couple friends & I were sitting down at an abandoned VIP table where I was approached by a not so attractive guy wanting to dance with me..and he was persistent about it, soo I just let him...ehh kinda bad mistake.  At least one of my friends who was meeting up with me came and found me while I was dancing with him, after he told me to do him a favor and dance with him the whole nite cuz I was the  hottest girl there ...just because I agree to dance with you for a lil bit doesn't mean I wanna stick w/u the whole nite, and u think sounding like a desperate psycho makes me want to??!   Anyways, after I pulled my girl to dance with us (givin her that DO NOT LEAVE ME look) she then told me that she wanted a drink...soo we left that guy and the guy that was all up on her on the dance floor, got her drink and just danced with our friends.

Grab 4 friends and split a bottle.  You'd probably spend that money at the bar anyway. You'll also appreciate having somewhere to sit and a slave to serve you. -- They will throw you out if they find you crying/napping/throwing up in the bathroom.

Bottles start at $400 and we got 3 or 4, i don't remember.  Tons and tons of eyecandy (our waitress was smokin') here, that I do remember.  Due to my recent hospitalization, it probably wasn't the best idea to drink; but i did a test drive at Tao the night before and came out ok.  So i felt prepared for some serious blitzing.    So Hef and his gaggle of girls (the old school and new school Girls Next Door were all there) partied all night.  Bridget did a little happy birthday song and striptease for Hef.  The Stanky Leg song came on, so we were doing the Stanky Leg dance.  I turn to the left and i see Kendra doing the Stanky Leg.  Hilarious.  And for you US Weekly maniacs, apparently this was the first time Holly had seen Hef since their  breakup , as someone explained it to me. So i guess this party (and emotional  reunion ) will be shown on E! soon.  I definitely was living in Silicone City that night.  Once the girls at the table next to us starting shoving jagerbombs down my throat, I knew I was done.  I left the club with different colored drinks spilled all over my shirt, so you know the night was legendary.  The music was fun and everyone had a great time.

Does that even make sense?  My new friends were nice - yes, they felt up mine & my cousin's booty, but I actually didn't notice because we were having too much fun on the dance floor. Fail on them for being from Boston. BOO CELTICS!  Overall, a really fun and chill place.  Lost a star for the random old school.  Generally, I'm cool with it - and even enjoy it - but it started getting to pre-60s...and I just wasn't feeling that AT ALL. Didn't get to check out the bar, but maybe next time. ;] (Looking back, I probably should've taken Boston Boy up on his offer.)  P.S.

Thursday night isn't their busiest night so my party (5 guys, 2 girls) didn't have a problem getting in. The interior is like a sexy futuristic spaceship that landed on the moon. The dancefloor isn't flat; it's textured so it looks like the surface on on the moon. Somone took the Moon idea too far.   The view from the balcony is beautiful and you can sit at the unoccupied tables. After leaving the club for a bit to gamble, we came back to see that the retractable roof had opened up.

He then seated us in a dinner type table with high chairs.  Which had a money view but had no room for more then 4-5 people really.   We discussed which type bottles to get and ended up going with 2 Grey gooses which went for $475 a piece.  A tad higher then Tao which went for 375 a bottle.    No longer then 10 mins after we sit down our bus boy who was complete money through out the night brings us these 2 smoking girls  who sat down with us.  Realizing it was a 3 on 2 situation I smoothly left the table and let my buddies work away.    So I decided to look around the club,  the outside patio is very nice and also has a few tables if you would like a table out there.  I also checked out the playboy club which was pretty much a small casino with $25 dollar minimums bets.    In between this time i met a few nice girls who humbled me with a few shots of petron.  I was pretty buzzed and was even considering leaving.  I ended up going back to my table after probably 3  hours of walking around the club which does not get crowded at all unlike some other Vegas clubs.   By the the time I get back the girls are pretty much on the way out and me and Donnie started hitting the dance floor.  We take a few pics with out staff and head home.  On a side note we were taken down on a private elevator by the bouncer, another  kickback from having a table at moon.

The views from the windows are fantastic, and the outdoor patio is a nice change of pace from the ear-blasting noise inside.  There are a lot of tables spread throughout in case you would prefer table service (i.e. where you reserve a table and have a minimum order - about $400 for 3 ppl).  If you choose to go with the bars though, there are plenty spread out, but the fastest are probably in the back near the restrooms - just tip big on your first order, and you'll get express service the rest of the night.  Another interesting benefit is that the club is connected to the Playboy Club, which has women in the famous bunny outfits, but also high limit tables (usually starting at $50 or $100).  So you can drink, dance, and gamble - all in the same place.

I loved my night at Moon.  We did bottle service/VIP here and it was well worth the cost.  Well, okay - so we did bottle service for the boys, and for the girls - we got ourselves in but it took all of 15 seconds.     The management, bouncers and servers/busboys were all FABULOUS.  EXCELLENT service all around, I'd give it 10 stars if i could.   Every single person working at Moon that I had to deal with or talk to on this night was nothing short of stellar, and the treatment they gave us was  first-class all around.  The way they had us enter was straight through the Playboy Lounge, and what I saw of that place, I was not impressed.  Head up the escalators to Moon and then voila - - - your night begins and all of Moon is conducive to having a good time.    We ended up getting a table in a separate VIP lounge area, a good distance away from the dancefloor which made it possible to talk as well as drink in private.  There are booths everywhere - and all of  them were nicely set up and comfortable, well-placed, etc.  But I never like sitting too close to the dancefloor where people are falling into your table, or you can't even hear yourself think, so this was perfect.    When you opt for bottle service at Moon, the service leaves you wanting for nothing, nothing at all!  To make a reservation, there is a form to fill out and you do have to hold with your CC unless they know you.  It was relatively easy, and even those in our party who were late got in without a glitch just by mentioning the name under which I'd made reservations.  Very smooth process.  Great music, great crowd, and a gorgeous club, to boot.  The patio area outside was fabulous - - view of the whole city, and lots of perfect photo opps out there.  Take a drink outside and get your groove going, come inside and dance the night away.  I would not have minded having a table outside reserved, and might do that the next time I am in Vegas.  Three bottles later - - we were all nicely toasted, and I think everyone could agree that it was a great time.  FYI:  Don't pass out.  If you pass out cold in a drunken stupor - they will ask that you be escorted out.  One of my friends had just this happen to him, and when I came back from dancing - - he was gone.  Hahahaha....

As far as the club goes, it's OK at best. I didn't hate it, but I don't think I would choose it over some of the other nightclubs Vegas has to offer. DJ spining that night played mainly hip-hop and top 40 which is the opposite of the house music they played at Rain.  We got bottle service here, and bottles and table prices were a little cheaper then typical prices of other higher tier clubs on the Strip. Hennessy goes for $425, which isn't a bad deal.  What's also nice with bottle service is that they give you VIP access to Rain, Playboy, and Ghostbar. After we got bored at Moon, we were inside Rain within 5 minutes.  Overall, Moon is worth a trip to. What I love about the Palms is that it's such a great party hotel with multiple clubs and different genres.

The worst part was when we were ready to leave, we had to wait over 30 minutes to get out. You have to take an elevator to get back down to the lobby. However, unfortunately, they would not let anyone in the elevator to leave. When we asked to leave, we were told we had to stay. We had to find management and specifically request to leave. Management even made all sorts of excuses for their inefficiencies and lack and had no answers as to why their establishment was so poorly run. Ironically, the other bar at the Palms, Ghost Bar, is on the same floor and was a much better experience. They had much better music, better ambiance, and had no issues getting any patrons in or out of their bar. Nor do any other clubs or bars I've been to in the world, for that matter.   Just a thought to keep in mind, when the line to leave is three times longer than the line to get in, that's not a good sign. Unfortunately, you will not know that until you get up there.

And I even got two free vodka well drinks!  They gave me a wristband with two little pull tabs.  You might have to pay cover if you went on a weekend.  I'm not sure if it would be worth paying a cover (I find almost nothing worth paying a cover.)  But it was definitely worth going for free!  I'm not usually a nightclub sort of gal.  I'm more of a  read the guidebook for the city I'm visiting to learn about the local attractions  sort of gal.  My Vegas guidebook said that you should  dress to kill  when going to Moon, and I had a bit of what-do-I-wear? anxiety.  So I upped my ante as high about as it goes by wearing a little black dress . . . and flats.  But I needn't have worried -- there were plenty of well dressed people there, and plenty of girls in killer heels, but also plenty of (very) weirdly dressed people there, and plenty of girls like me in sensible shoes.  Lots of major hipsters, a couple of them a bit old to still be dressing like they ironically bought their clothes a size too small at the local Goodwill.  I had a great time dancing, and the dance floor became crowded quickly, even on a Tuesday night.  The atmosphere feels a bit space-age, which is fun.  At one point the staff gave out these huge foam light-up glow sticks, that everyone was waving around.  It looked very cool!  Plus, drunks are fascinated by flashing, light-up things.  The best part about Moon is the view from the outdoor patio.  It's lovely and cool with a breeze, even on a hot desert summer night.  And you can see the whole strip!  (The view may be slightly better from ghostbar, a lounge that's located on the other side of the Palms. I'm pretty sure you usually get a stamp that gives you admission to both clubs when you go to either one.)  Moon has a retractable roof, but they only opened it (briefly) once and then closed it back up again.  I'm not sure why.  I didn't buy any drinks, because I'm cheap and I'm sure they were ridiculous Vegas club prices (and I got two free drinks anyway.)

(I love to dance to hip-hop when it is done right, but when I show up at a club and 75% of the songs feature the word  SHAWTY , it is time for me to leave.) Plus, if you want hip-hop, you can slide downstairs to the Playboy club; they do a decent job with hip-hop, but I find the decor disappointing. There is no reason that Playboy needed to try to fit into an Ed Hardy world of badness. But, I digress, so at Moon, the music is right, which means the dancing is right, and generally on Sunday nights it is not too crowded. I hate crowds, as I actually like to move on the dance floor, not just bounce up and down. The staff is always pleasant and professional. The view is amazing. The roof is a nice spectacle.

The Go-gos have rockin bodies and can actually dance which is a nice change from those girls that just wiggle in their boots and bounce their huge fake boobies for 20 mins.

There will be a point when you'll pay to get into the Playboy Club/Moon and you can get into the Ghost Bar for free and visa versa.  ie.  Sunday night at 1:30 am you pay 30 bucks to get into the Playboy Club/Moon and show your stamped wrist and they'll let you into the Ghost Bar for free.

I went last winter and sadly they didn't open it but the venue is pretty nice especially with the balcony over looking Vegas.   In order to get into Moon, you have to go through the Playboy club.

The music was fun to dance to; they played Rap and Top 40, but it was incredibly crowded - we could hardly stick together on the dance floor amidst being separated by creepy ass sugar daddies.

Moon is no exception.   The 30k milli's are rampant in Vegas. For those of you who don't know what 30k milli's are, they are merely guys and girls, usually guys, who act and spend money like they are millionaires, but in fact are nothing but a regular 9-5er. They drive the used beamers and wear their silver plated chains, douche glasses, and reek of aqua di gio. They are the loudest and the most obnoxious people I have ever seen. They pop bottles with their maxed out credit cards all to try and impress the Socal princesses who think they deserve the best. I smell insecurity. Regardless of that fact, It has its positive notes.   The clubs in Vegas are not my scene. I go once in a while to people watch and just to check out the scenery and get to know the vibe as to what draws people to these glorified sweat boxes. I like to go with friends and just sit back and enjoy the wonderful people having a good time.   Moon, is definitely one my favorites in Las Vegas. The club is not too big and not too small, has multiple floors, flowing booze, good dj, outdoor patio facing the strip and just overall a good scene. The go-go dancers are definitely easy on the eyes and they move like they aren't going wake up the next morning. They play anything from hip-hop to some house and the DJ will never let you stop dancing regardless of what he is playing. The drink prices are steep. I paid $11 for a rum and coke. I'm sorry but ladies, if you want a guy to buy you a drink, especially from myself, you need to offer more than a pretty face. Beauty is too common in Vegas, what else you got? Nothing? Then no drink, go find yourself a chump who hasn't been to his first rodeo yet.   The Playboy club is usually included in the cover charge. Or if you know a host or someone who knows someone, you can usually get in without any hassle while the other people in line look at you in envy. :)  Definitely check the place out if you have never been.

It's an absolutely amazing venue, but too bad Vegas can be full of douchebags. And this my friends, is a bag full of douches. If you decide to come here, the place is a primer for things about Vegas.  1.) Vegas is about tips. This effects your place in line or where you are able to stand in a club (i.e. VIP). We, thank god for a friend... managed to be in the right line and not have to pay the shiteous $40 admission fee ($60 if you intend to party hard).   2.) Women as the world works, have an easier time of getting things for free. They even have their own comp passes. This is because Vegas is a sausage fest. You would never know that from walking on the strip and being handed cards full of girls for sale. Me and my friends contemplated collecting and playing goldfish, drunk later.  3.) A recession will still even make Vegas a little bit expensive.  And so this is where our experience is shaped. The girls who were scattered through the legion of men were trashy. I remember this one girl dancing for herself in this ugly pink dress sashaying on the platform. Vegas isn't your runway when you don't know how to work it, honey. I would think it would be dangerous to wear sunglasses in a city that embraces strobe lights everywhere it gets the chance.

We definitely wouldn't have enjoyed it though if we didn't have a table. The line to get in was easy breezy too. I've had experience at other places that we've gotten table at (ahem, PURE) and been treated like shit and had to wait for 2 hours to get in, even though we paid over $1200! So getting in quickly was a huge plus at Moon. Plus you can get in to the Playboy Club too. But we didn't make it that far... :) Views are awesome from the Palms that high up.  The dancefloor was miniscule for a Vegas club and altogether unimpressive. There were not multiple dancefloors or DJs but there were several bar areas, one being outside and quite nice. The roof wasn't open when we were there, except for about 5 minutes later at night (I read somewhere that they open it at 3AM). Since we didn't have to deal with going to the bars I can't judge the prices of drinks nor the bartender's talent. Music was decent; don't remember hating or loving it either way. Only chicks are allowed to dance up on top of the booths. We chose to dance on the benches within our table area, which was a major foot saver from the previous night at Tao.   What I find particularly strange is that at Tao and Moon, I was stabbed with pieces of glass in my foot! Coincidence? I don't know? Just really odd that two nights in a row, my foot was bleeding from two different broken glasses on the floor. After all my clubbing/bar days, can't say that's EVER happened. I was impressed at Moon though, how the host took care of me immediately and I was  treated  in the back with all the employees to make sure I was OK. My sister got stabbed with glass in her foot too. Weird.,  I've been to better clubs elsewhere so I'd have to say I wouldn't return unless we had a table again. And maybe it'd be nice in the summer when it's warm and the roof is open longer. That's it's main gimmick and sounded like a good idea in general.

My girlfriend and I came on a Sunday night around 12AM. Although there was a line, the bouncer told my friend and I to go directly up to the rope where they were letting people in. When we went up to the rope, another bouncer asked us if we had a reservation or if were on guestlist. After telling him no, he let us in right away anyways.  The cool thing about Moon is that it's up past the 52nd floor. So from the outdoor patio/smoking area of the Moon, there is an amazing view of the Strip. As for the club itself, it isn't very big, but the atmosphere is pretty chill. I feel like they have a good sense of how many people to let into the club. The Moon is small, but there was a good amount of people in there. There's enough people in there to have fun and not have the place feel empty, but little enough people so you can still dance (not ridiculously packed like at Tao for instance).  The club is pretty cool looking and if you pay cover for the moon, you have access to Rain, Ghostbar, and the Playboy Club. Yeah, the drinks are kinda expensive, but hey, you're in Vegas, and they don't skimp on your alcohol here.  Definitely a fun club. Music can be good, but also kinda sucky.

Moon also has a retractable roof, but it was closed on this particular Tuesday night.  Of course, it was also a hot July evening in Las Vegas, so it's highly probably the roof doesn't open until it gets a lot cooler.
