All I can say is WOW!!  Your meal comes with a delicious brazillian buffet style salad bar which includes things like fried plantaines and other things you do not normally find at buffets. The best part of the meal is yet to come so dont eat to much off of the buffet. The waiters then start to bring around a parade of scwered meat. Parmesean crusted fillet mignon, bacon wrapped turkey, roast beef, spicy chicken, tri tip, Etc. The best part is that they cut it directly off the spit and put it on your plate. This was some of the best meat we had ever eaten. And towards the end of the meal they brought out a fresh grilled pineapple. This was amazing. You just eat until you are done and then flip the top you have at the table over so it is red as to say STOP WITH THE PARADE OF MEAT!!  If you leave the green side up they will continue to offer you more and more and more.

Someone suggested that they had a pretty good variety of meats so we decided to give it a try since there was a groupon. So for 79$ you get all you can eat surf and turf( meat and seafood) the consisted everything from sirloin to lamb. Then the surf part which consist of mussels, shrimp salmon and tilapia? Comes on a separate plate. I can't rave too much on the food because some of the meats were quite dry but I did like the shrimp and sirloin. The salad bar was decent  with a variety of vegetables and hot dishes.   So an alcoholic beverage is included in the deal, I got a chinahuia (sp?) with pineapple, lime and tequila. Not too bad; definitely my  kinda drink. The hunny had a rum runner and it was poured much heavier than my drink.   So overall, it's an okay restaurant but for the same price I would go to texas de brasil. They have much better meat.

Times Square, Hollywood Blvd, and the Las Vegas Strip. What do they all have in common? Crap food served at chain restaurants. I don't understand why people travel thousands of miles and end up eating at a restaurant that has a location around the corner from their home. While checking out some show tickets we asked one of the employees about some good lunch places that are different than any chain restaurants. It was lunch so we were looking for something cheap, but tasty. The guy told us about a Brazilian restaurant called Pampas that's inside Planet Hollywood.  It's no secret, the hotels on the Strip are massive and act like a maze in order to force you to walk past as many slots, tables, souvenir stands, and other money wasters as possible. It just so happened that Pampas is at the very end of Planet Hollywood. Nice.  We were given coupons for $5 off which includes their salad lunch buffet and the meat rodizio. Normally this is $20 which is pretty cheap, but the coupon makes it even better. Our server gave us a green and red card thing and we were told to flip it to the green side when we get back from the buffet and the meat carvers will start making their rounds to our table.  The  salad  buffet was amazing but it didn't have too much salad which is fine with me. There was a few different pastas, vegetables, cheeses, and a couple types of salad. I'm not going to lie though, my favorite thing at the buffet were the squares of feta cheese. I downed at least fifteen of those awesome squares of happiness. Also, they had slices of salami which were fantastic.  I'm not much of a carnivore, but every time one of the meat carvers came over I got extremely happy. The choices included smoked ham, bar-b-q chicken, spicy chicken, bacon wrapped turkey, sausage, bar-b-q pork, and sirloin. The best ones in my opinion were the sirloin and sausage. I couldn't try the bacon wrapped turkey though because of my stupid allergies. Dumb. One other option they had was grilled pineapple which was just as delicious.  This is definitely a restaurant that makes sure your tummy leaves happy. The  all you can eat  style usually fails miserably in regards to taste. However, Pampas seemed to excel higher than any other restaurant I've been to of its nature. We were so full when we finished that we all had to sit back and relax for a while before we started walking down the Strip again. I ate so much that I think I heard the chair crack a little before I stood up.

To be perfectly honest and frank, I have been to several Brazillian grilles in the past and this falls to the bottom of the list. The meats were inconsistent in terms of quality, often under or overcooked. My girlfriend and I went for lunch on our last day in vegas, and lunch had 7 meats. We were very dissapointed in those options. We also got to try their filet mignon wrapped on bacon, and it was the cheapest quality filet I ever have had. Hailing from a place near the water, my girlfriend and I are used to quality seafood. The surf and turf option is something to avoid at all costs. Even if you were able to get it half off, still avoid it. My girlfriend and I are feeling horrible right now and we are pretty sure it is from the seafood. The bottom of one of the pieces of fish looked like a piece of moldy trash. The shrimp obviously was older and had been previously frozen. The mussels, I believe, were the cause of our current discomfort, and should be avoided as they may cause food posioning, the jury is still out on that though. Lastly, the buffet bar is small compared the other Brazillian Grilles I have been to, and does not have very many options.   The atmosphere was odd, as the music choices varied from sad and monotomic to hard rock, with little to enhance the authenticity of the establishment and its brazillian heritage. Service was ok, but nothing spectacular. The servers of the various meats often gave poor pieces, rarely giving center cuts. They also came around sparingly at times, as only 2 were working from 3:30 to 4:45 that we could tell. Our waiter, Rigo, was nice so this review is on indicative of his job. Rather, it is indicative of the chefs and management of the establishment.   All in all, unless you can get a discount and eat here for less than 20$ a person, don't  even bother checking this place out.

In act I even suggested my friend use Pampas for her reception dinner after her wedding dinner coming up this spring (probably 40ppl).    Pampas has high quality food (wish they'd stop pre-dressing the Caesar salad though) & good quality meats. When I brought friends from MI here this past Feb we really enjoyed the fun made to order drinks that the lady makes at her cart-going table to table (fyi-2 of the ladies that work there are past Olympian's in Volleyball).    We always get great service & very pleasant ... not the case today... from the get go our server  Kelly  was rude. She spoke to me in a very condescending tone... kinda like she was annoyed with me. I am one of those people who doesn't like bloody meat. I had asked 3 different Rodizio's if I could get some cooked a little more. Typically this is no problem. I was sitting & waiting & sitting &  waiting (probably 20mins) while everyone else got their mid rare meats. I finally saw the server again & asked her I she could please check on this for me. Instead she went off on me! I saw the people at the next table look over toward our way because of the tone she had used with me.  Well it takes more than a minute to cook it!  spoke very sharply & LOUD. I am normally not a drinker & try to stay clear of sodas. Kelly was good at refilling our water & taking away any dirty plates, this I will give her. But she is also very good at being rude to customers. Yes, I had a coupon... I know a guy who's wife works there, she said  everyone uses coupons there-not a big deal  If the company didn't want people to use coupons then they wouldn't give them out. It is NOT Kelly's place to judge me for having a coupon! Actually I never mentioned the coupon. When our bill came it was for dinner price (we came while it was still lunch price but ran over into dinner) And it said Wingate on it. I tried to get her attention but couldn't. As the mgr Kate (who is awesome) came by I said  I believe that I have someone elses  bill as it also had sodas on it  All of the sudden Kelly emerges & snapped at me that's how it's done when it's THAT coupon... I said  but I don't have a wingate coupon  her reply- a sharp  yes you do, that's what you told me!!!!  I had never mentioned any coupon at all to Kelly. She walks away clearly irritated at me. I said to Kate that this seriously is not  my bill. It actually would have been cheaper but I'm not trying to rip anyone off. Kate took it to Kelly... Kelly redid it, again for dinner. I said to Kate, we came at lunch time. Kate said she would take care of it. This time Kelly pretty much slams it down in front of me & it now it the same dinner bill but with 3 copies. She walks away without saying a work-her attitude said a lot though. I then go to Nelly the awesome hostess who sat us with the bill. She said  oh no, you 2 were definitely here before dinner started  Then Kelly says to me, once again rude as can be...  I was told by the manager to make it for dinner!!!!!  which I know was a lie. I did get it fixed to lunch. We tipped on the total bill before the discount. We tipped on the bank card so she would be forced to give the rodezios their share & we tipped about 18%-20% on the pre-discount price. I understand that the meat rodezios might have forgot me. BUT the attitude & rudeness that I received from Kelly was uncalled for.     I will go again, I will continue to tell friends about Pampas, I hope that my friend does have her after wedding dinner at Pampas. I will just make certain to request NOT to have Kelly as my server & I will tell my friends to request not to have her as well.    I definitely recommend this place, it is yummy & actually a good price for being on the strip. They have coupons & deals online, thru out the casino, on groupon, on restaurant.com. The people who run it realize that it's cheaper to do coupons than it is to pay for commercial time.    So my advice to anyone reading this.. go to Pampas, enjoy it, it's great there but request to not have Kelly as your server. You want to enjoy your meal experience... a Brazilian Steak House is an experience. Just don't have Kelly  as your server or your experience will be ruined!

We ordered drinks and the waitress brought them and left didn't see her much. The meat came around very slow and wasn't impressed at all with the salad bar. I finally asked for a refill on my tea. About 5- 10 min later she finally brings me tea with melted ice... iced tea is supposed to have ice right?? Especially in vegas where it's hot as hell. So I politely ask for ice she takes the cup and seems annoyed and I never see again. I had to go find the manager and ask for tea and explain she took the cup and never returned.  All the while him and two other Co workers or management Is sitting on there butt talking. He brings me the tea with ice and I'm annoyed now politely tell him we live here we aren't tourists so if service is bad we don't return.  He doesn't seem to care and now I see why all the reviews are bad here. Lol by then my meat is cold and lunch is runied. We finish and have to ask the waitress for our check of which she didn't even have the sense to apologize or say sorry. Of which goes along ways with me. I understand we all have bad days or shit going on and not a good day. She could have redeemed herself with a simple hey I'm sorry. But she dropped the check off and walked away with nothing... apparently management doesn't care how the employees come off to customers or assume this is vegas we will get business anyways. Nor did management have the nerve to apologize and say hey sorry about the service i will speak to her and send her over.  Was the worse service I've had in along time and won't be going back.

So we made a reservation for 5pm and promptly were seated when we arrived 15 min early. the waitress we had was such a sweetheart she told us how our coupon worked and what we were in for 11 different meats! There is a yes/no indicator on ur desk so when the dervers come around with the meat they can see wether or not u want some or not. So we went to the salad bar, im pretty picky when it comes to some things so although there was much variety some things were intresting...to say the least althought the fried bannanas were delish! And the sauted carrotsmmm!   After we got back to our desks the first person came around with sausage and turkey wrapped in bacon, the bacon was a little salty but good none the less. After that was lamb, i recommend it with the sauce its like a vinagrette delish! After that was tenderloin, roast beef, fliet minon(sp?) One thing I didnt like was the fact that we didnt get the chicken to the very end, they came around 2-3 times with same meat options and we would say no cause we were waiting for the chicken, so finally when we were almost to our limit here came the chicken and it was magnificent! it was like a spicy and you get a whole breast piece. So after we ate, we counted back and noticed we werent offered al the meats but oh well what are you gonna do, gotta leave some for next time i suppose.

I would say there were about 6 different types of meat that came by, nothing grand, but definitely a jaw workout, it was either dry/tough or bland.

All the negative reviews are very true.  If you've been to another Brazilian restaurant, this will be a huge huge disappointment.  To boot, it is overpriced for the food quality and variety -- think about it, if over 50% of the diners have half-off certificates, it's because they're tourists and have never eaten here.  I apologize for being so negative, I usually try to find the good in establishments but there isn't much good here.  The best part of my dining experience was my server, Cynthia (she was absolutely awesome!) and the fried cod (from my seafood option).  Yes, the fried fish was the best part in a Brazilian restaurant.  My experience as a diner started out, on a 105-degree day, of the maitreD insisting on seating me as the 2-person table at the far end of the bar (farthest away from servers too!)-- facing the mall hallway and 100 feet away from the outside doors facing the heat.  When I noticed the heat and sweated immediately, she told me that it was airconditioned (as if it was my imagination).  This was early, too, around 530 p.m. with restaurant 80% empty.  Not only did the meat servers ignore me (being out of the way), but I began sweating even more (hey youre splurging for a supposedly nice meal in a nice restaurant on vacation, that aint right).  I politely asked my server if it was possible to move somewhere cooler and after much discussion with the maitreD (who acted all surprised-shocked that I didnt like my table, doh), they allowed me to move inside where it was 15 degrees cooler at least.  I wish I could say that the dining experience was tremendous free there on.  I really wish.  But other than my server's attentiveness, it was god-awful.  Honestly for what I ordered (the churrascaria with the surf and turf), I would have been better served by dining at a nice casino buffet like Planet Hollywoods for half the price (take the prime rib, carved turkey carved ham plus the middle-eastern meats and add the seafood dishes with the various salads/desserts and it's 10x better).  Specific reasons why I am so negative: 1. Horrible Logistics -- Instead of having 3d red-yellow-green wood that a customer can place on a table to indicate whether he wants servers to bring meat, this restaurant uses plastic decals (smaller than a coaster) that lay flat on the table and cant be seen by servers -- thus they breeze right by you table because they cant see that you want food. 2. Poor Maintenance -- They did something to the floors (extra wax???) whereby people were slipping and sliding as they walked to the salad bar or restrooms, which by the way were kinda nasty. 3. Poor Quality and/or Prepared Food -- which is the main reason a) Iced Tea -- I asked for unsweetened regular iced tea and received a fruity version (which can cause dietary isues) as the original server (in the bar) didnt feel it necessary to tell me (I thought the tea was rotting or going bad based on the unexpected  flavoring ). b) Over-Seasoning to mask either the quality or preparation.  Filet mignon that was tasty if you could get by the intense seasoning...after a few bites I couldn't eat it.  Even the ham tasted like a salt shaker -- I mean, ham is the easiest meat to cook with a little seasoning (if at all) to be flavorful.  On the seafood option, the ahi tuna skewers were all over the place -- sometime cooked just right, sometimes chewey/overcooked, and so overseasoned it wasnt edible.  Next to the ham, the next easiest (or even easier) item to not screw up is grilled pineapple -- instead, I received thin, tart, hardly grilled pineapple (the kind youd get at Country Buffet).  Even the deep-fried bananas on the salad bar-buffet were soggy and mushy.  Did I speak to management and express these concerns?  No, I figured if they work there and supervise and taste their product, they should have a clue (a manager was going through the restaurant asking patrons regarding their dining experience -- honestly I just wanted to finish and leave and be done with it).  It is what it is....a $20 meal for $50-60.

Long story short. They refused to honor the offer via RetailMeNot.  Fine.  We were there...we ate and left. Our bill total was about $82.  I added tips and rounded up to exactly $100.

I was with wife and kids and wanted quality food, nice setting, a bit away from casino smoke.  It's a very nice setting.  Upscale interior, solid furniture, nice waiting area.  Service was uniformly good if not great throughout stay.  It's a nice upscale all, right on the strip, and most importantly, it was very reasonably priced compared to other VEGAS Strip eating options.  If this was in Henderson, I might give it 1/2 star off as Value would fall.  They have an excellent $6 Steak and Eggs breakfast.  Steak is top sirloin, served to your desired temperature (like mine medium).  Eggs were standard scrambled the way I ordered.  Potatoes were fried  home fries .  For Steak and Eggs of this quality, would have paid twice this and been happy.  Now on to lunch.  I had the meat  buffet  option both other times.  Now, most importantly you have to understand this:  * Quality of meet for $20 buffet lunch is not going to be what you would get for a $40-50 dinner buffet at other Brazillian restaurants.  It's just not going to happen.  Instead, you get very tasty sausage, rotisserie mini chicken pieces, bacon wrapped turkey chunks, and some slice top sirloin.    No premium meats.  But the meats they give you are tasty and filling.  Plus, you get an excellent  salad bar  buffet.  I'm not a huge buffet person, but it's a nice one.  Cheeses, olives, salads, soups, breads, etc.  I thought the calamari salad was pretty decent, and loved the fresh mozzarella, olives, artichokes, heart of palm salad, and a few other dishes.  So say what you will about this restaurant, but I think it's a decent to very good value.  I think the setting is very nice.  The service is good.

Often when we can't figure out where to eat and we've exhausted our yelp lists, we go to groupon for suggestions. Unfortunately, I was less than impressed with our experience. The hostess was fine as she sat us at our table. When our server greeted us he was very nice. We informed him of our groupon and ordered our drinks. The drink cart girl was very nice but a little over the top. We started with the salad bar and there are a lot of good options. When we got back to our table, we noticed that some people had markers to let the meat servers know to come to their table but we didn't. That was a little confusing at first, but then a meat server did finally come to our table. The first few times the meat selection was either bacon wrapped or well done. I informed a few of the servers that I could not eat pork and preferred medium rare. I'm not exactly sure why a high end steak place is serving well done steak as the main cook temp. Some pink or red on some of the steaks would have been nice. We did get the surf and turf, but were disappointed that it didn't come with the lobster. I was also kinda grossed out by the shrimp. The coloring was off and it looked very limp/weak. No thanks. However the other surf options were better, the salmon was good and the white fish was very flavorful.   Anyway, after a few rounds of well done meat, we did get one medium sirloin and it was really good. Although I was mostly full at this point. I'm not saying the meat tasted bad, because it didn't. It was on the whole quite flavorful, but there should be a varied options for cook temps. Medium rare people don't like well done people don't like medium rare. Offer both. It makes no sense to only have well done. The service was pretty good, although the table next to us had a lot of issues. She was also irritated that all the meat was well done or pork.

I then found a deal on travelzoo, and the plans were set.   Even with a reservation, we had to wait a while (about 30 min), it's a popular spot.  You are seated, a friendly waiter greets you and takes drink orders, then you're sent to the serve yourself hot/cold food bar. This includes sides such as rice, grilled squash, salad, and my ultimate favorite part of the whole night.... (Gluten free) Brazilian cheese bread aka Pao de Queijo... Oh my goodness is this bread amazing. It may have been the highlight of my entire trip to Vegas!  Our travelzoo deal included a bottle of house wine, it was a Cabernet Sauvignon, and it was nothing special- a CA cab that was metallic and pretty cheap tasting. This wasn't even offered by the glass on their wine menu, so I know it was a cheap offering just for the deal we had.  Then came the meats...  I believe there were 12 that came around? Chicken thighs, bacon wrapped filet mignon, sausages, lamb, pork, it seemed unending. We had to turn down most of the meat they offered because I was so full from the sides. I had the idea in mind that they would be bringing a huge slab of meat around, and that it wouldn't be fresh. This is not the case, they cook a fresh item then walk around with it once until it is gone, then bring something else fresh a few minutes later.   There is a sign to put on your table, a wooden sign with a green side (bring more food) and a red side (we're taking a break/done right now), but even when we had it on red they still didn't skip our table just in case we wanted the new meat.  This was a great experience, we'll be back.. For me, maybe just for the GF cheese rolls!", "Date": "2016-07-25", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Alexandra", "ReviewID": "ce3hZ4805UmmdQiFYiTpYw", "Overall": "1", "Content": "In a word: Yuck.    Got a Groupon for this place (Lunch for 2 for $28, I think?). Was hesitant after reading some extremely mixed reviews but figured, why not?  We came for lunch on Black Friday around 1:30, without a reservation, and though the restaurant was only about half full we had to wait for 10-15 minutes before being seated.  Our server, Kelly?, introduced herself and seemed nice enough, but seemed to forget about us throughout the rest of the meal and our bill was ALL sorts of messed up! She tried to charge to charge me TWICE for a $10 drink (Honey, I had one, it was disgusting, it took 20 minutes for you to bring it to me in the first place...and I wonder how many other 'drunk' customers you tried to pull that crap on).  Additionally, there was some sort of $18 additional fee for using the Groupon...wait what?! ....so in reality, it was $28 + the $18 fee the restaurant charges...oh yeah, and water (flat OR sparkling) is $6 a bottle...so bare minimum, lunch actually came to $58 plus tax and tip...and believe me that did not in any way reflect the quality of the meal.  Yeah, it was a 'surf & turf' all you can eat kind a thing, but Eeeeeesh, gross me out! The salad bar reminded me of the kind of $10 buffet you find in one of the area discount  casino/hotels, and I would say 9 out of 10 of the cuts of meat that were brought to the table were either grossly overcooked or raw. Plus, they brought around the bacon wrapped chicken, and some sort of sausage thing (read: the cheap stuff!) to the table at least 3-4 times each, but only ONCE, in the entire hour and half, brought around Picanha (steak)...and the slab they cut off for us was still bleeding.

Cons - Portion size is too much. Like another reviewer said, it's all about quantity vs quality. If I'm going to end up paying $130+ for 2 person, I'd stick w Texas De Brazil or Fogo De Chao (it be cheaper and way better food)  - Majority of the meat I had was too well done making it hard and chewy. BBQ pork wreaked of BO aftertaste. Thank goodness it came last cause I lost my appetite. I literally thought the smell was from the waiter but I was wrong lol  - Floor is super slippery  - Bar selection is not great (food and space wise). The layout and area is so small that you have people running into each other. Most places give you certain appetizers (bread, mashed potato and fried banana) but it was served buffet style.

We came around 4:30pm on a Tuesday and it wasn't crowded and we were seated immediately. The waiter was nice and attentive and helped us with our orders. The menu was very expensive but because of the gift card we decided not to worry about the cost. I got the skirt steak which was $29, my mom got the salmon which was $27 and my grandma got the dinner buffet which was $25. My steak was really good I had no complaints with the taste of the food. My mom however thought the salmon was plain and dry as well as the wine she got. Both me and my mom decided to substitute one of the sides of our entrees with the garlic mashed potatoes. When the food was brought out however, the cooks forgot that we substituted our sides for garlic mashed potatoes so we still got our original sides but the waiter was fast in bringing out little sides of the garlic mashed potatoes instead. My grandma wasn't too happy with the soup selection of the buffet but she liked it overall. They did charge for water which was pretty dumb especially since our waiter brought out a second water that we didn't ask for and didn't drink.  What most annoyed me was how people would come around with cameras asking to take a complimentary picture (which was not complimentary they give you a tiny wallet sized picture and try to upswell you a bigger one for $20) would pester us while we were eating twice! Right when we got our food this lady comes up and rudely interrupts our eating and almost demands that we take a picture because it was  free . It was just aggravating that while you're eating a nice dinner with your family you're being badgered by people. People were also walking by constantly through the tables trying to advertise their meat on the sticks which was also mildly annoying.  I get annoyed pretty easily and just want to eat in peace so I give this restaurant 3 stars since my food was good and the waiter was nice.

The other couple we were with are BIG Brazilian BBQ fans and they were really into it, I'm not as big of a fan and wouldn't have chosen it myself, but I was outnumbered as my husband likes these types of establishments as well. However, I did end up enjoying myself a lot more than I thought I would.  We went to Tix4Tonight and got a coupon that basically took off $18 a person for the all you can eat meal...so we paid $3 to get $18 off, a savings of $15 total. That made me feel better as I certainly didn't think I would eat almost $50 worth of meat, so I would definitely suggest doing this deal at Tix4Tonight.  All 4 of us got the all you can eat which includes a salad bar of various offerings like cheese bread rolls (OMG those were REALLY good!), garlic mushrooms, pasta salads, rice, mashed potatoes, etc. It was a nice showing and I enjoyed many of the things offered there.   They also have  drink specials  where you can pay $20 for unlimited beer and wine, $25 for unlimited beer, wine, and sangria, or $30 for unlimited beer, wine, sangria, and caipirhinas. I opted for the $25 and the other 3 opted for the $30. The caipirhina gal pushes a cart around in circles just re-filling as many as she possibly can. She will mix and match any flavors you want using syrups. Real caipirhinas typically used muddled fruit for flavors and not syrups, but since these were all you could drink and she needed to make a lot fast, they cheated and used syrup. This didn't detract TOO much, but for a caipirhina purist, it could be an issue. The service was excellent on all levels all night. We were never without drinks (which made the extra money mostly worth it), meats, or fresh plates.   The food itself was also good. They had a pretty big choice of different meats that they come around with on skewers cutting you off as much or little as you want. Almost everything we had was very good. Some of the meats come out more or less cooked and you can ask for the  part  you want. I myself like my meat well done so I asked for some of the beef well done and they actually went back and cooked me my own plate of well-done beef....nice touch.  While I wasn't thrilled to go here originally I did enjoy myself and my meal. I would not be opposed to going back if others in my group really wanted to go. I just feel like for $35 dollars (or $48 if you pay full price) you have to eat and love A LOT OF MEAT and I'm not a huge  steak off a stick  person LOL, but there are lots of people who are and I think if you're that kinda person, you'd love it! :-)", "Date": "2016-01-17", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Nha", "ReviewID": "fS43dDQzza9L_anur7Ymtg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I've been a fan of Pampas in Palo Alto and I'm definitely a fan of the one in Vegas.

First they brought some shrimp out for the table, not bad but my husband was really the only one eating it.  Then they brought the sausage around, EXCELLENT! Roast, and the sirloin, ummm, let's say I tried a couple bites and thought I'd save room for the next dish.  Ham came around, not bad, not great. Chicken... took a look and passed.  There was a very tasty steak (the star of the show) that was actually very good, that and the sausage were really the only meats worth eating.  $3.50 a glass for very flat soda, mandatory to use the coupon.  (along with a $1 per person  water conservation  charge)...  Seriously?!? When the waitress came around (she was very nice btw), we explained that the soda was completely flat and maybe they needed to change the CO2. She said they have but they've been having a lot of trouble with it.  REALLY, this $3.50 FLAT soda is mandatory?  When the bill came we had asked to split it in half and pay with 2 cards (mine and my daughters), I guess half meant something else to her. Anyway... Soda, I did explain that we felt taken being forced to order $17.50 of flat soda and they should be ashamed of themselves.  I did this while standing over my flat Diet Coke and my flat Sprite that I had barely taken a couple of sips of.  She said she would talk to the manager. She came back with $7 cash since she couldn't fix the bill. That's ok, but $7?   Oh you want it all back?  Of course we do! I told her don't worry about 1 of them, our teenage grandson didn't mind... Teen boys just drink it, fair enough there! Again, the waitress and most of the staff were very nice but had we paid $44 a plate for this lunch I would be demanding  a lot more than my soda money back!", "Date": "2016-08-15", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Rebecca", "ReviewID": "rXw78pIjODQt13Vp5Q3bGA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Service here is great- Grasi in particular!

Not sure if it was because we were still in our wedding clothes, but hey, it's nice to receive great customer service anywhere!    I love the concept of Brazilian BBQ, and we were always being waited on by the roving servers with the skewers of delicious and tender meats, large shrimp and the palate cleansing grilled pineapple, which was very sweet and helped with digestion of all the food...  The cold and hot food buffet was really good because it was not overwhelming and had stuff that went well with everything we were served.  I thank them for their excellent service, as well as the delicious food!  They now have a repeat customer in my wife and I, and since she doesn't have Pampas in NY, I have one close to me in Palo Alto, CA, and may head there for a taste treat!

He said,  I just want to take you girls out for a nice dinner.  Awww!  Wow, so I was stuffed from eating at the Mint CMYE earlier that morning. Lawrence said to get whatever, but I was a bit uneasy looking at the prices. It's not cheap - the salad bar alone is about $25! He said not to worry because it was on him. I ordered the taquitos ($9) but our waiter, Andreas, told me they ran out of chicken, so I ordered the salad bar.   Jen ordered chicken satay as an appetizer ($9.) A bunch of skewers came stuck in a half a lemon with a little plastic container of peanut sauce. I could imagine Chef Gordon Ramsay throwing a fit over the presentation - I'd skip the lemon slice and just lay the skewers on the plate and put the peanut sauce in an actual (non-disposable) container. Anyway...  Lawrence ordered salmon and Jen ordered chicken, which was a huge portion and was really juicy and tasty! ($30+/each) The waiter, Andreas, said the entrees came with  salad bar,  Caesar salad, or mashed potatoes. It's a bit confusing because those items are both on the salad bar - and no matter which of those three options you choose, you can still go to the salad bar. The menu needs to clear up that wording because it's confusing - just say all meals come with the salad bar.   I have to say that the salad bar isn't really a  salad bar  if you're expecting something like Sweet Tomatoes. Nope, it's more like pre-made pasta and seafood salads, various soups, bread and anti-pasta. The roasted red peppers, my favorite, were so delicious, as was the hearts of palm salad. The feta was nice and briny and went well with the artichokes. I'm not one for seafood, but the calamari salad was so good and the lamb stew was divine! The money spent is worth unlimited lamb stew for sure! I wasn't a fan of the feijoada, which was 99.9% just black beans, but the marinated mushrooms were scrumptious and I went back for thirds!

First I must admit I don't eat beef. So my review personally is based on what I did eat - chicken and pork.   The chicken wrapped in bacon is heavenly. I've tried to duplicate it to no avail.  Somehow they are able to infuse the chicken with the smokey goodness of bacon and it is amazing!!!  I love a nice crusty piece of ham. Again they somehow are able to do this and retain the juicy ham goodness.  Their side buffet of choices had scrumptious offerings too. I love the fresh mozzarella drizzled with balsamic, garlic mashed potatoes and cheesy bread.   Nathan had his share of all the meats and said they were expertly done. Nothing bad to say about any of the cuts.   We were waited on expertly by Dave. He was ever present with a refill and blessedly absent while we were chowing away.

The turkey wrapped bacon did nothing for the taste of the meat but make it too salty.    The seafood was decent, but I've definitely had better. My favorite thing was the ham and pineapple, but only because the pineapple was so good.  It definitely wasn't worth the money we spent.

This is my first time eating at a Brazilian restaurant.  The experience was amazing and the Father's Day gift certificate ($40 off through the month of June) was the icing on the cake. Pamas Churrascaria is tucked into the south end of the Planet Hollywood shops.  If you go in the correct door, it is immediately on the left - otherwise you get to wander through the maze of 170 shops looking for it. We had reservations (highly recommended) and still waited for about 10 minutes to get a table (not too bad).  The host was very good but spoke a little too fast for this novice to catch everything he was saying. One of the managers (Michele R.) came by while we were waiting on our drinks and talked with us about Pampas and what we could expect.  From my questions, she offered us a tour of the kitchen and then took our picture in front of the grill.  This was a very nice touch and certainly helped me to understand what to expect from the overall experience.  She also made herself available to us throughout the night - checking back to make sure everything was just right for us. Michelle (our server) is from Chicago and has the great Chicago accent.  She is friendly, knowledgeable and fun to talk with.  Service could have been a little faster for my taste but at 7:15 on a Saturday evening with a wedding party on board, it gets a little bit crazy around there. The food is amazing - 10 different kinds of meats, all freshly carved and served at your table.  The all-you-can-eat seafood was freshly prepared and very good but I was already getting full from the all-you-can-eat meat and salad and side bar by the time it arrived. The desert tray looked fantastic but since I cannot have sugar, I asked about some strawberries.  Michele R. came to my rescue (again).  The rest of my table enjoyed the chocolate mousse.

Pastas and bean dishes are offered to fill up diners.   The six meats that were offered consisted of bacon wrapped turkey, sausage, ham with pineapple, spicy chicken, BBQ chicken, pork, and sirloin. The latter were the best items. The beef was cooked to a nice medium rare and juicy. The pork was flavorful and possessed a nice spice rub. The pineapple was something my friend and I wished came around more frequently then once. The chicken didn't have much going for them.

It is so bad that they need to hand out coupons and advertise for people to eat here. Really? I almost equate this place to a poor man's Churrascaria lol. Service here is mediocre and the food comes out very slow compared to the competition, where food seems to flow out and is carved at tables non-stop. I've only been here a couple times in the last 4 years and it's only usually when I get a comped meal, gift card or coupon. If you don't have any of those then it's not worth it because after visiting the salad bar you'll be waiting all night for the meats to come by. And when one comes, you'll be waiting forever again for the next guy to stop by.  The food itself is ok. I'm not a big salad bar person at these types of places because everything is premade and they usually don't have any regular salads or sides. The quality of the meats are hit or miss because sometimes they are too overcooked. I guess if you like your steaks well done then you won't mind. The meats that aren't overcooked are sometimes too salty which makes them hard to eat as well. I also hate that they don't bring you any fresh sides with your meal because everything is up at the salad bar.  The good news is they have happy hour so if you like wine this may be a good spot to check out since all their glasses of wine are $5, I believe, during happy hour.

The deal was the Surf & Turf Rodizio Lunch for two with two specialty cocktails and one desert for $47 (lunch).   We went shortly after the New Year and Las Vegas was still rather busy with tourists so we didn't expect to be seated right away - however - we only waited 10 to 15 minutes and we were led to our seats by a staff member (we later learned that Heather is the manager and she was just lovely to us).  We've been to restaurants similar to Pampas Churrascaria before, and I really do not know what the negative reviews are all about but our experience was nothing short of brilliant.   The food was amazing. Our Groupon included seafood, and everything on our seafood plate was just delicious. My husband is a huge mussels fan and Heather even brought out a bowl of just that - mussels heaven! Instead of cocktails, we had a beer and a red wine. We're simple like that. The servers kept on coming with the meat, and I think my favorite was the pork while he loved everything beef (other than mussels). Our desert was Tiramisu and it was just the perfect ending to our awesome lunch.   Heather was very apologetic for making us wait, but honestly, we were so relaxed that we didn't know why she had to apologize.  Food? Great. Service? Awesome. Customers (Us)? Happy.   I understand that customers cannot all be 100% happy but our experience couldn't have gone any better.  Maybe we just had a better attitude coming in. We already were having a great day and Pampas Churrascaria made our day in Vegas even better.  Some customers just like to complain and I wouldn't let the bad reviews sway you.  I say go and try this place out; try everything (they even have a great salad bar) and come out fully satisfied. Also, know that Vegas gets busy at certain times of the year and so when it is the busy tourist season there - expect a wait. That's just how it is anywhere that attracts so many people each year.

I stuffed myself like I was living my last day on this earth. The meat came at decent time intervals. I especially jumped at the chicken, bacon-wrapped turkey, and sausage.   My server, however, was quite cold and rude. She flinched when we mentioned that we had the Tix4Tonight voucher, taking away our menus immediately (what if I had wanted to browse it further?). Instead of giving us tap water, which she did for the adjacent table, she handed us an Acqua Panna bottle ($6.95). Two weeks later, I am still perplexed as to why this happened (I clearly did not say bottled water). She also consistently failed to check up on us, bypassing us as she checked on her other tables. I sometimes wonder why such people decide to go into the hospitality service. Needless to say, her tip was accordingly small.   p.s.

First of all, the benefit of going to a churrascaria is to be able to sample many many different types of meat. I honestly feel like at Pampas, they only have about 5-- that is including the grilled pineapple. None of the meats were top quality like what I've previously experienced and they have no chicken hearts!! Bleh.   We also ordered the seafood option as well and it's pretty much as bad as the meat. The scallops and shrimp were tasteless, ahi tuna overcooked and the rest of the platter left me feeling unappetized.   The pitcher of sangria we ordered can hardly pass for sangria. With no fruits in it and no fruity taste, it fell short of being just cheap wine.  Lucky for us, our friend had a coupon for $100 off.

The lunch menu and dinner menu were no different except for the price. There was a $20.00 difference, so to beat the dinner traffic and save some money we reached the restaurant hidden in Planet Hollywood right before lunch ended at 4pm. Now mind you this was on a Monday, not a day that fell on a holiday or any special discount days. Just a regular Monday. So we reached the hostess and was relieved there was only a few people there. There is inside seating and somewhat of a patio area still inside the mall area. We planned on ordering the Surf and Turf Rodizio, which is the all you can eat brazillian meats, seafood and with the salad bar. But for some reason this hostess decides to seat us all the way in the backside of the patio and is super far from the salad bar. I look and see there is no one seated at all inside near the salad bar. The last thing I wanted to do was walk 2 miles for the salad bar. So I ask nicely,  Can we get seats near the salad bar inside ? She lies and says  We don't have anything available .. WTH really? This is my one pet peeve when it comes to restaurants. I hate lying employees. It may have been my hunger getting the best of me but this was not the case. They wanted the restaurant to look like it was busy but screw the facade. I was trying to get my grub on. So we wait for the meat to come around to our table and it seems like a lifetime. The waitress we had was Lizette and she was attentive and courteous. Which is not what I could say for other waitresses who look like they were hating life. The meat finally comes around and my husband gives the sirloin and tri tip the thumbs up. They had the pork which was tough and unedible. The seafood was tasty but the mussels and salmon were bland. The white fish and shrimp were better.They provide you with very small portions for a place that serves all you can eat. More like all we can try.  The salad bar didn't dazzle but it made for fillers for the meat. I recommend the cheese bread. We had no problems with our service going forward but I only made one trip to the salad bar because for me it wasn't worth going back multiple times because they sat us near state lines. I waited for the sausages but by the time they came around we were already full. But as I contemplated the tip at the end of our meal, I decided on the bare minimum of 15%.

When we showed up the hostess tried to put us outside where everyone walks by you. We noticed that's whereshe tries to put everyone initially. It's obviously is an effort to gain attention of by-passers, who think  wow, let's eat here, it's so busy .   It's very impersonal area, so we said we will sit inside.  So now she makes us wait for like 7+ minutes.  The inside was nearly empty and we still waited.  The waitress looked  frazzled  that we choise to eat inside.  So she seats us next to an entry way like a thoroughfare, but this place is nearly empty.  Many nice tables available.  Then we waited nearly 10 minutes for someone to say  hi  I'm your waiter/waitress.  We were just ready to leave this place when out of the blue, a waitress greets us with a really bad vibe, unhappy feeling, impersonable to say the least.  So I order the unlimited meat thing for $37.95 or close to that price.  Well to keep this short, the meat carving people DO NOT make their rounds consistently.  They leave you waiting for more than 10-15 minutes at a time before another meat arrives.  I sat there looking around thinking what the heck is going on here?  Then someone shows up.  You can feel the reluctancy to carve you any decent sized portion.  Then you wait 10-15 minutes... another person comes, you get the picture???  One of my guests had a halibut fish at $27.99.  It was sadly the size of a king-sized pack of cigarettes, with some steamed veggies and that was a bit dry.  This was a let down.  My wife's dish was a lobster bouilliabaise.  The dish was mediocre, the tiny shrimp you had to find in the soup, the mussels were so tiny that I cant believe they would serve that!  The pasta was overcooked.  They only served me 5  types of meat while there. The filet mignon was the only one I could comfortably chew.  The rest of the meat was not very tender and tasty.

I should have payed attention to the other Yelper comments out there, and I got burned.  Oh yeah, our seats were badly covered in grease drippings and other spills left behind from customers.

We have been to quite a few and they all have the same theme, which goes as follows...  One is greeted by their waiter before heading over to the  salad bar . (Calling it a salad bar is an insult because it's so much more.) You get your  salad  and start to enjoy the gourmet offerings of artichoke hearts, asparagus, fresh cheese, marinated mushrooms, and sun-dried tomatoes.  When that is finished, one is given a clean plate and the red/green card on the table is flipped to green meaning  Bring on the meats!   During this course, men with large skewers of roasted beef, chicken, lamb, and pork take turns delivering their goodness to your table.  After you have eaten yourself into oblivion, you flip your card to red. This is the equivalent of waving a white flag on the battlefield.  Depending on how much you want to suffer during the next six hours, you can peruse their dessert offerings.  The entire time this is happening, your waiter is being attentive to your needs.  Yeah. This is NOT how things happen at Pampas.   First, be VERY careful when walking in this restaurant. The stone-tiled floor is greasy so it is very slippery. The table even moved when touched because the floor is so greasy.  Despite the floor, our meal started out ok enough. We went to the  salad bar  for that course of the meal. After it was clear that we were finished with that, our waiter took our plates.  So we sat waiting for clean plates. (Insert crickets chirping here.) Waiting, waiting, waiting...  We finally flagged down our waiter and asked for clean plates, we were told that we were supposed to use the small, oblong utensil plate for our meats. No, no, no....we want a real plate, please.

Prior to asking, in our first 45 minutes there, we had been only been offered chorizo and ham. When we did finally start getting food, most of it was dry and/or unseasoned. The only cuts either of us actually liked were the chorizo and the bacon-wrapped chicken. When my wife wanted another drink, we once again had to seek out the hostess and ask to get one. And when it was time for dessert, we ordered flan, which isn't a dessert they make on the spot (unless it's a box mix, I guess). It should have just been a matter of picking up the dish from the fridge and bringing it out, but it took so long that we gave up  and went to the hostess to ask for our check for the one drink we had that wasn't covered by our Groupon. Maybe our experience was a result of having a Groupon?  Again, we waited as the hostess consulted with two servers, neither of which were our server. I had to walk over to them again and this time asked for the manager. We waited several minutes for the manager, as the hostess asked to to  hold on  while she seated other guests. I got so tired of the waiting that I actually just told the hostess,  nevermind, we're leaving  when she turned around and said  there's the manager .  The manager was apologetic (nobody else was), but despite our experience and my request that she just comp us the $7 or whatever for the drink, since we didn't even have the dessert that was supposed to be included, she still insisted that I needed to pay  the tax . It was only $2.49, so I paid and left. But I'm not sure what was taxed. Sales tax is 8%, so to have $2.49 in sales tax would require a bill of over $30. And, again, we had a Groupon that covered everything except for one sangria, so I'm not sure what I was being taxed on.  AVOID THIS PLACE.

And just as he kept his word to us on our visit to Las Vegas, I'm keeping mine to him by writing this review.  Because of my encounter with Bob, who asked that we revisit the restaurant before we departed Vegas, we did. And I assure you it was a much different experience. Both visits, the food was good, but I am a stickler for customer service. Not only did Bob rectify my issues on my first visit, it was obvious that he addressed my concerned prior to visiting again. It was also surprising to see that he was at work again, so obviously he takes a hands-on approach to management and has great work ethic.  The side items were different on each visit, and we even tried some of the other menu items.

Then she directed us to the salad bar after we came back to our table from the bar Jackie brought us our drinks. Everything was fine until that point another gentleman brought us a plate of different types of seafood which the food was absolutely delicious and different gentleman came up to watch able to give us different type of beef and pork. 20 minutes later I asked the server how do I order more seafood because I wanted more seafood he told me just tell your server Jackie passed by us not once not twice but six times without asking us if you need anything else. I called her over and told her that I would like more shrimp she said ok and that she was going to bring up over some clean plates. Another 20 minutes past with us sitting at the table when she returned she asked us if we would like the dessert when I told her no she said do we want her to bring us the tab. I told her I am still waiting for you to get us our seafood. No apology was received for her forgetting to get us our food and she bought us over two clean plates. I was already frustrated because not one time did she ask if we needed anything and we had to call her to our table and our table was right in the center of where she was serving everyone. There was hardly anyone there the only thing that I could assume is that she was just new. Another 10 minutes passed by and still no food. I've again called her to our table and asked her did she put our order in. She smiled and said yes then a couple minutes later a gentleman came up to me and asked me who was my server. I told him who it was and after that he went up to her said something and left. Time passed no more food was served to us. I had to leave to catch our flight because we realized we spent almost 2 hours there and were served only once. I called her over again completely dissatisfied and told her to give me my bill. I had a restaurant.com certificate that when I told her about it she said they didn't accept because they had no internet. I was like omg really?? The icing on the cake. She started speaking to me like I was retarded and didnt understand her. I then asked to speak to the manager whom was very nice and I explained everything that happened.

[they don't have them, so don't tell me about the  7 tradition chrruascaria meats ] What should one expect from a restaurant named for a region more associated with a different country than what it purports to be.). It was adequate, but would not have been worth the price if we'd paid full price. Like many of our fellow diners, we had a voucher for one entree and (one trip to?) the salad bar, so we took the $8 up-sell to the full meats. That wasn't bad. (What is a normal tip on a meal with an artificially high price, and half self-service?)   The salad bar wasn't overwhelming, but had a few particularly good items (grilled mushrooms, hearts of palm, tortellini.)   There is an open-bar option: unlimited beer, wine, sangria or caiparinha for $20. That's probably a good deal if you were going to order drinks anyway and drink heavily. At their prices a 3rd drink would probably cost more.   Loss of a star (and should have been a loss of tip) when our waiter asked we wanted to drink we said 'Just water.' He asked 'Still or sparkling?  I found out that is a trick question, as he brought a liter bottle of water.   When the bill came (after a long wait trying to get the waiter's attention) there was about an $8 charge for the water. The waiter was at that point holding a pitcher of water. I asked about the charge and he said  I asked you still or sparkling and you said 'still'   I pointed to the pitcher of ice water he was holding and said  What do you call that?  and he said  Tap water.   I said  When we said '_just_ water' that's what we wanted, it's not sparkling.  He said he would find the manager and have it taken off.   I'm sure the time share that gave us the voucher compensates the restaurant. We accepted the up-sell for more meat. (The limited menu, and a big plate from the salad bar, would have been sufficient.) There is no need to nickel-and-dime the tourists. (Some of us argue the charge, the rest probably pay the $8 for what is indistinguishable from tap water.

To start with we made a reservation for two to be seated at a booth.  The hostess was pleasant.  We arrived to a full house with only a half table half booth for two on the outer perimeter of the dinning room next to a wedding party.  We saw two other parties seated next to us assigned a waiter before us so we waived the next person down to be serviced.  The waiter we were assigned was not attentive or detail oriented and apologized for forgetting about us multiple times.  In addition, we had to waive down the meat skewer servers to get food.  By the time they serviced us our side dishes were cold.  The servers that passed us were mostly for the wedding party... I recommend requesting middle dinning area seating because the servers were more attentive there and they received the meat service first.  The meat tri tip was decent, the sirloin was overcooked, the seafood plate (salmon, muscles, shell on shrimp, and halibut was cold by the time it arrived at our table.  The sides are self serve buffet style at the rear of the dinning area.   This didn't feel like a fine dinning experience or even a great introduction to a Brazilian steakhouse. The service was mediocre, the food quality did not reflect the price, and the ambiance was not romantic.  I constantly had my head on the swivel and had to work to flag people down to get fed.  This type if dining was not for me. I prefer a seamless dining experience.  We only saw our waiter 3 times total.  In the beginning and then after we spoke with the manager and again shortly thereafter to deliver and pickup the check.

Unfortunately, I was not blown away. While walking up to the entrance, I noticed the greeter passing out coupons to people passing by. When we came up, she asked us if we had reservations. We did. She tried to discreetly hide the coupons and led us to the table. When I inquired about the coupons, she acted very annoyed and was hesitant to hand one over. So what? Just because we already had plans to eat here meant we weren't allowed to get a discount? I did not like her attitude at all.   The waiter was decent, but was not especially helpful. He did what was required, explaining the menu and keeping our water glasses filled.   We were able to go to their buffet for side dishes, and the meat dishes were brought to the table. The side dishes weren't impressive and they were very slow in bringing the meat rodizio around. There were only two guys walking around at a time, then they would disappear, and it was quite a wait in between until they came out with new meat entrees. The food was ok but nothing spectacular, also a little on the salty side.   My boyfriend ordered the meat rodizio while I ordered the seafood rodizio. They brought out a tiny dish with 3 scallops the size of nickels!!!!!!! The salmon and cod were the size of half a deck of cards each, and 3 shrimps on a skewer. I had to order at least 3 orders. I understand that maybe the Gulf oil spill may be limiting seafood choices, but scallops as small as nickels???? For $45??? That was pathetic.  I was ok with a nice dinner in Vegas and we spent what I expected to spend. But I probably wouldn't return to this specific brazilian steakhouse. I might try ones with better ratings.

That's pretty much the only reason I'd want to hit up a Brazilian steakhouse. It did include sirloin with mashed potatoes and the salad bar, so we plowed onward, but it was the most underwhelming experience our entire time in Vegas. We left glad that we didn't pay $43 + tax & tip for bad food and slow service.  Our food took an hour to come out. Half hour into the order, we were notified that the computer went down, and our order hadn't been sent back to the kitchen. Ten minutes later, the kitchen was  working on plating it , and yet it took another 20 minutes. What the hell were they doing back there? The meat is presumably already cooked since the servers are walking around the restaurant with it, and the plating was nothing special - just sliced meat on a plate - so why did it take 30 more minutes on top of the computer failure? Barely made our show.  The salad bar was odd. There were Caesar salar makings, but no Caesar dressing. There was sweet and sour chicken (at a Brazilian place?) and some pastas, but few enticing veggies. I piled on the potatoes and carbed it up. We grabbed some cheese bread (pao de quiejo), usually heavenly, but it was very over cooked, downright crunchy, and hard. The sirloin was good, but not wait-an-hour good...  Two gentlemen next to us at the bar had the rodizio, but it was served onto tiny plates, and they kept having to flag down servers as they went by.

Being a vegetarian married to a carnivore, the meat-lover in my husband was actually quite fulfilled by the abundance of fish, clams, and calamari on the salad bar, so we each ordered it.

Was told the shrimp and salmon were delicious - i couldn't try because of food allergies. The mussels and white fish were also very good. Not too impressed with the skewered meats, most were overcooked and dry, but the bacon wrapped filet was awesome.   Even when asking the skewer servers for a med rare slice, a small piece or any request, they gave you whatever they wanted to.   The specialty meat was a grass fed sirloin, mine was very tasteless and chewy but my friend enjoyed his slice.  Overall we had a fun experience, but we are ready to try other Brazilian restaurants to compare.  Thanks to David for making our visit to Pampas special.  We need more like him!!!!!  5 stars to David.", "Date": "2015-10-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Will", "ReviewID": "fT0Uu-X6CJWZp5xC630-Aw", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Take your money to Texas De Brazil...the food, ambiance, and service is ten-folds better there.

As opposed to some groupon establishments, they really attended to us like we were full paying customers.  We made reservations and were promptly seated within 10 minutes. The salad bar is amazing. Theres so much selection, but just the right amount. Theres a little something for everyone ! Soup, mashed potatoes, grilled veggies, salads, breads, and even some pasta and rice.   Onto the meats, the bbq pork was sensational. Well done, yet moist and tender, just the right amount of seasoning and glaze. It was amazing. Prime rib and scallops were also amazing. Could not get enough of the shrimp ! The chicken and ham were okay, not bad but forgetable.   The service was great. The cooks slicing the meats were very kind and had great sense of humor. Our waitress was amazing. She came at all the right times, and came by just enough.   As we were leaving , I asked for the bill, and to my suprise ir was $1.40 , I waved our waitress over thinking this was an error, but it wasnt ! She decided to not charge us for 2 beers and an iced tea because our table was not ready at exactly oue reservation time !  I was in shock. And left a very generous tip.

I sure do love rodizzio style. there is quite the selection of meats being continually brought out. This is awesome b/c you are continually being served hot meats (no homo lol). My favorites are the bacon wrapped turkey, the sausage and their grilled pineapple. They also have some various steak cuts, chicken, ham, etc. The one complaint we would have is all their meats are consistently  salty. It could just be us though b/c we tend to eat low sodium meals.  My tips would be these.... 1) Don't waste your $ on the seafood upgrade. For what they offer it's definitely not worth the money. i will admit the ahi was good but that's it. The one item they offered that we were looking the most forward to were the shrimp and they came out dry as eff. Complete and utter let down. Service here is always on point unlike Texas de Brazil who consistently have the worst hostesses.  2) Go to discount tix tonight and pick up your meal voucher for a fraction of the cost or keep your eyes peeled on Groupon for a 2 4 1 voucher that usually includes 2 drinks to boot! Lunch is until 4:30 so have a late lunch and call it an early dinner to save some $ :)  And I would definitely order a caipirinha, just note they are ca$h only (I think $5 + tip).

Since we knew this is a meat buffet kind of thing, we came very hungry. We arrived and got seated fast. 2 servers came for drinks or whatnot before our real server even got there. We already had our salad/appetizers in place when the real server came and took our orders: 2 seafood for the girls and 2 meat for the boys. Simple, right? Let's see...  One meat came after another serving the boys. Looks good, smells good, tastes good...the boys had it good for about one hour while the girls sat down nibbling on some salad...waiting for some seafood. We were waiting for half an hour when we asked one of the girls who brought us meat if we can have some -- she said,  you ordered seafood, you can't have meat.  Okay then...  We waited another half an hour for our seafood to arrive (mind you: our real server didn't bother coming during our total 1-hour waiting) to no avail. Thank goodness for the salad bar and conversations that kept us sane.   Finally, the real server came and we asked how long it usually takes to prepare the seafood. She scrambled her notepad and from her verbal responses and facial reactions, it seemed to have forgotten that the girls ordered seafood. But she tried to cover it up by saying:  Let me check the kitchen.  So she left. Shortly, she came back and said,  Oh I'm sorry, they threw away the paper that I gave them. They're cooking it now. Do you still want it?  We said yes, and she gave us meat plates (to indicate to the others that we are now ok to receive meat). Then our server said:  I will tell my manager to remove the seafood off your tab.  We said thank you.   4 types of meat came but we were already full from the salad. By the time the seafood came, not only we were stuffed but they were fishy and oily. So we stopped eating after one bite.   Then we recieved our tab. ALL regular prices. I was confused. Our server said that she will remove the seafood off our tab. What she ended up doing is 'replace' seafood with 'meat' instead. Replace? That's not the word I remember her say.  I confronted (calmly) our server and told her how I understood her when she said  remove the seafood  from our tab and when she gave us meat plates. I said:  I thought that was your gesture of saying sorry for letting us wait an hour and 10 minutes for our right food to arrive.  Then I added,  I didn't ask for meat plates -- you put it on our tables so that was to imply you're giving it to us so we'll have something to eat while waiting.  And when the server answered me:  Oh, you mean give you $40 worth of free food? No, we don't do that.  At this point, I was irritated.   So bottom line, we were ripped off. We paid full meat price when we only had time for 4 rounds and a bite of their fishy seafood items. This doesn't even include when the boys had to ask the servers to bring them the rest of the meat mentioned on the menu to make sure they get what they were promised, plus we had to ask for drink refills, and we had to ask for soup bowls in the bar.   If there was a negative star on this rating, I would give it. Only two of the meat that we ate were better than what we make at home -- the rest, mediocre -- not worth for the money.

I really liked how it felt somewhat romantic, but I think it would have been a good spot even for a bunch of friends or family. The waiter boasted of the salad bar but I didn't think that they had a lot of great choices. It was a bit of a let down. The soups were soo good though, as was some of the cold pasta salads, so there was enough for me to eat. (Don't miss out on the cheesy bread either! It was my favorite non-meat item.)  The meats- -Everything bacon wrapped was delicious, but then again what isn't? -Sirloin. We had them keep bringing it back. So moist, perfectly seasoned and the definition of a good piece of meat. -Grilled pineapple. Not really a meat but it was brought out in the same fashion. Loved it! Wish that they served it with the ham though. By the time the ham was brought out, the pineapple guy was nowhere in sight.

Other places (Fogo de Chao, Texas de Brazil) have pretty high quality goods on their bar, but not Pampas. It was filled with the cheapest salad bar ingredients possible. No asparagus, no artichoke hearts, no high quality cheeses, just a bunch of junk. Even the salad bar at Golden Corral is better! The little cheese biscuits were tasty but that's it. Sure, their gimmick is that it's  unlimited,  but so what when there is nothing you actually WANT to eat!?!  The rodizio food was even worse. We had a special deal to add the  Ultimate Surf and Turf  seafood option. This was a COMPLETE JOKE. I expected fresh shrimp on skewers but nope, we were served a teeny salad sized plate with two small pieces of salmon, a small portion of mussels and 4 (yes, FOUR!!!) pitiful looking unshelled shrimp. That's it. The seafood was pretty bad and I have never felt so ripped off. They have the gall to charge $58.00 PER PERSON for this junk!   The service was so awful. I realize the place was inexplicably packed on a Friday night, but there were plenty of waiters around so there's really no excuse. We had to wait for water refills and even for forks! The guys bringing around the skewers weren't knowledgeable about anything they were serving. We kept asking about the sausage and he would only say  it's sausage,  though the menu mentions there are several different kinds being served. He had no idea what kind of meat he had either! WTF? Poor staff training!   One of my friends skipped on the all you can eat and ordered a steak a la carte from the menu.

We were promptly seated and greeted by our friendly server, Jessica.  She went over how the dinner worked, as we had never been here.  I was pleasantly surprised at the selection on the salad bar; I love vegetables!  They had fresh artichokes, mozzarella, pasta salads, fruit, etc.  My husband was hit and miss on the meat; some was overcooked, but nothing to complain about.   Having been in the restaurant industry for many years, I can see through the BS that most customers on here have complained about.  It seems as though the restaurant has coupons all over the place, which doesn't always bring in the nicest of clientele.  The more discounts and coupons offered, the more picky and complaining guests you are going to have.  The table next to us complained about something and the manager comped their ENTIRE meal!  From what I observed, nothing was that bad.  That is not how to get repeat, quality customers.  Apologize, fix the error, buy them a round, but for the sake of the server, don't give away the house.    The best part of our dinner was our server.  Having grown up in WA, Jessica and ourselves had a lot to talk about. Seahawks, Mariners, the crappy rain in Seattle, awesome concerts at the Gorge, you name it.

There was also a big selection of hot side dishes and cold salads to choose from at the salad bar buffet.  The downside  was that the hot sides weren't so hot and the cold salads were about the same temp.  I liked the beans, rice, and the yummy parmesan-crusted moist and flakey rolls (which managed to stay warm).  Those were the only memorable sides.  The memorable meats were the pork loin, moist and well-seasoned, although a bit too salty, the turkey sausage, thick and juicy, the spicy chicken, crisp on the outside, moist inside, the roast beef (deliciously tender) , and the lamb, though not that tender had great flavor.  And the grilled pineapple was the bomb.  That night we had efficient and friendly service.    Of all the choices you have in Vegas, this is a pretty decent one if you get the discount price from the  1/2 price ticket booth .

But after my recent experience there, I am compelled to write. Sorry for those of you who are only interested in the food. My only regret is we didn't have as good a time as we expected.  More than 15 friends and I all traveled to Las Vegas to celebrate a friend's birthday on May 24. One of the places the birthday girl was excited to eat at was Pampas. She made reservations and everything was set. So we all get there and they kindly accommodate our very large party (20). Everything is going well, the food is not too bad, but before the waiter leaves, the birthday girl asks if he could separate our checks. Sure, he says. Later, she asks him again. Same response. We get our check (which totaled more than $1,000), and they tell us they can't separate the check. The birthday girl asks to speak to a manager. When it came time to confront the waiter about the whole separate checks issue, he calmly says  No, she didn't.  So, when we ask the manager to rectify the matter, she says their policy is to charge 15% extra to do so if there are more than three cards being charged. That's an extra $150 just so they could charge us separately -- AFTER we asked them more than once to separate the check. Before this, there was never any mention of any charge. The manager was quite unforgiving and rude. Once we decided to simply put the whole amount on another friend's card, she nonchalantly asks,  Would you like dessert?  It wasn't free, by the way. I'd just like to say thanks, Pampas staff, for ruining what would have been an otherwise pleasurable birthday celebration.  We didn't even receive the red/green stick indicating when we'd like our food. Not even 30 seconds passed from the time we sat down with our buffet plates to the time the meat came out. It gave us a feeling of being rushed -- before we were even given the chance to START eating.  As for the food, it was not too shabby. The filet mignon, though, was bland and dry, even though it was quite pink in the middle. Which shouts,  I've been lying around for a while!  It definitely wasn't terrible, but not worth traveling from four different states and $1,000 just to be treated rudely. I'd suggest any of the other thousands of other places to eat in Las Vegas that truly understand what customer service is all about. Very, VERY disappointing.

They have one beef based meat to choose from, then lots of cheaper cuts filling in the rest of the rotation. I felt sorry for the  roasted ham  guy, going from table to table, begging people to take a slice of ham from him.  The chicken was tasteless, the bacon wrapped turkey had soggy bacon.  The actual steak tasted ok, but the fat in the cut had not been rendered down, resulting in a really chewy mess.  The  surf  part of the meal was a disaster.  The salmon was old and fishy. The tilapia was not cooked through.  The shrimp was rubbery.  I do have to say the bacon wrapped scallops weren't terrible. The plate went almost entirely untouched.  It was difficult to get my water refilled.  For lunch, they had us sit in a section of the restaurant as far away from the salad bar as possible, resulting in many pilgrimages across the empty restaurant for the deep fried bananas (the best thing on the salad bar).

I've been there plenty of times and have always enjoyed the food but the last time I went there for dinner the food and service was not up to par as I have previously experienced in the past.  My boyfriend and I came there on 12/30/14 around 730pm we were told they were not allowing anyone to be seated unless you had a reservation which didnt bother me I'm reasonable they seemed a little busy but I had never had to make a reservation before and there next available reservation opening wasnt until 9pm.  When we returned they immediately sat us in the bar area and we sat and sat and sat while watching the waiters pass our table and while watching others be seated after us and being assisted by thier waiter.  I finally complained to the manager that we had been sitting here for at least 10mins the manager seemed annoyed that I was annoyed.  I asked the manager to move us into the bigger dining area and he did and we were then immediately assisted by a waiter.  We took to the salad bar area hmmm somethings missing seems to be a lot less hot items at the salad bar than there was on previous visits.  Then the food starts coming to the table all the meats were either too raw  and I like mediums rare  the meats were tough overcooked and underseasoned.  Ok surely they can make up for this with that bacon wrapped scallop and the grilled shrimp that Ive had everytime Ive come there but nope no scallop, no shrimp. I asked the manager about it she said yeah they used to have it for dinner but they no longer serve it.  Another waiter came by and placed a small plate at our table and said your surf and turf. it had a few mussels a small piece of grilled halibut I think it was and a couple of nonmemorable items.

We had found a groupon which was $65 all you can eat surf and turf + salad bar, plus 2 cocktails and 1 dessert. First off, it says $65, but after tipping (we tipped according to how much it would have been without the deal) it cost us about $95 total. It still isn't a bad deal because I think our total would have been about $140 (not including tax or tip) anyways if we didn't have the groupon.  It was pretty busy when we got there so that was a good sign I guess. The waiter was very attentive and showed us the details of our deal and what we got. I was thinking that we get two free cocktails regardless of what they were, but actually there is a list of 4 to choose from. This includes a mojito, 2 brazilian cocktails, or a margarita. My girlfriend chose the margarita and I chose the mojito. I feel like the mojito barely had any alcohol in it, but the margarita was super strong haha.  The salad bar isn't really that big compared to Via Brasil and Texas De Brazil. Regardless, I enjoyed the roasted mushrooms, pasta salad, beets, and cheese bread (amazing, might I add). I know my girlfriend loved the mashed potatoes and the cheese bread too.  Ok, now the meat and seafood. The shrimp isn't peeled, which really bothers me for some reason. They do taste good though after you peel them and whatnot. The mahi mahi didn't taste right to me, and the salmon was OK - nothing too amazing about it. I think the best of the meats were the bacon wrapped filet mignon, bacon wrapped chicken, beef tenderloin and spicy sausage. My girlfriend really REALLY liked the bacon wrapped chicken though haha.  For dessert we had the Tiramisu which was pretty good.  Last but not least, service was great and our server was on top of everything. He kept our waters filled up and was very attentive, which is a big deal for me.  Overall I think this place was OK....nothing too spectacular or amazing about it.

It was slightly crispy on the outside  and juicy on the inside. The flavor was delightfully sweet and salty. If you're looking for a small meal, this would be the perfect choice.        - Rib Eye Steak - The steak comes with their Buffet Bar that's priced at $24.95. The Buffet Bar is definitely not worth that much. I'd say $10 at most. I ordered the steak medium rare and it came out as so, but it wasn't tender at all. Somehow they managed to make the steak as hard as if it were cooked well done, while having a pink center.  **Recommendations**        - I wouldn't recommend this place at all.

You walk into a dark alley, and a well dressed, clean shaven, nice looking man, his face partly obscured by the poor lighting approaches.  You take a deep breath, and start taking larger and quicker steps.  He leans over, and whispers in your ear:  how about a great Brazilian dinner at half price, my friend? .   You make your best uninterested gesture, but your face screams:  tell me more .  So he does.   $34.99 includes all you can eat grilled Brazilian meats, perhaps twenty kinds of them.  That's 50% off!  You're hungry, it's hot, you almost surrender.  But the nice man goes on:  free access to the buffet, which has forty kinds of side dishes, fruits and vegetables, and even more meat .    One minute  you say, and turn to consult with the family.  Where's the family?  They're gone.  Instead I see three full size lions, their teeth sharp, their tongues hanging out, drooling all over the place.   Yes , I say to the nice man.   Yes!!! .   We go in, and we sit down, and our waitress, sorry, our server, comes by for introductions and instructions.    In order to use your half price deal, you must order an alcoholic drink from the drink menu , she opens.   Wait , I say,  the nice man never mentioned that .  The server says calmly:  nonetheless, this is the deal .  We pretend to consider, but everyone knows there is no way back now.  We surrender.  We order a beer, a Lemon Drop, and whatever for the kids who aren't allowed alcohol anyway.   Then we visit the buffet, and bring the loot to the table.  Then a marching band of meat carrying young men walk by us, at the rate of one per minute with the most delicious meats we had in a very long time.  Garlic Sirloin, coated chicken, lamb, Filet Mignon, Sausage, and many more mouthwatering meats are dropped into our plates and devoured in no time.   Wow, it's really amazing.  The excellent meats and the alcohol, make us forget the nice man in the dark alley.  We almost forgive him.  Until we see the check.   The check puts you in a very compromising position.  It actually registers the amount without the discount (we would never set foot in this restaurant without the discount), and with the discount, but with the drinks that we were forced to order, and then makes a very silly proposition: you can choose a tip amount of 30% on the amount before discount, or 30% of the amount after discount.   At this point, despite the excellent meal and the alcohol, we realize: we've been cleverly lured into a very flavorful trap, and the only way out is to pay the ransom and move on.   So here's my review.  If you want a great meal, at a good restaurant, on the strip in the heart of Las Vegas, and you are prepared to pay about $60.00 per person, go for it.  Dinner was quite good indeed.  But if you think that a promise of a man in the alley will get you a great dinner at half price, you got another thing coming my friend.

We had reservations for five at 9:45 p.m.  We made our reservations through Tix 4 Tonight / Tix 4 Dinner.  This allowed us to pay 1/2 price.    Upon arrival the hostess showed us to our table.  The initial service was a little slow but we expected that from the other reviews.  Our waiter appeared and we gave him our 1/2 price voucher.  He told us how things work, took our drink order and told us we could help ourselves to the salad bar.  I have been to Brazilian Steakhouses in Houston, San Diego, Dallas, Florida and Buenos Aires.  This one follows the typical format.  Large salad bar and then the endless parade of meats.    Standouts at the salad bar included the salmon which was spicy.  I also liked the plaintains.    The meat was very good.  Plenty of it.  Servers that knew rare from well done.  Lamb, steak, chicken.  A particular standout was the spicy chicken.  The serving size was very large, moist and perfectly seasoned.  Diners at the table also enjoyed the turkey wrapped in bacon.  It was different and a nice change of pace from the meat.    The staff was attentive and even brought us additional lamb when requested.  A small complaint was that the filet mignon had a slightly gamey flavor that it shouldn't have had but the picanha was on target.  Also, this style of steakhouse typically uses a lot of salt on their meats and if you are not used to the flavor then it can sometimes get overwhelming.    Remember.  You do not have to have a slice of every meat or item that is brought to your table.  You can and should be selective.    The wine list had reasonable values for a restaurant in a hotel casino.  For example, a Kaiken Malbec by the bottle was $35.00. House wine was $30.  Four stars because of the 1/2 price voucher.  (Total meal cost with two bottles of wine was $48 per person with tip).  Only three if we had to pay full price.", "Date": "2009-12-22", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Casey", "ReviewID": "D9mniOKyM9P9GfCp0Bun0A", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Went here for Valentine's Day.

Service was a complete 180 from our first time. We gave it another shot on Valentine's yesterday. Service was the complete worst iv experienced anywhere. Our waitress Alessandra was terrible and it's nothing personal I think that she was overwhelmed within her own capacity as when we got there the restaurant was only half full. It took the first round of meat 20 minutes to arrive and about 30 min into our dinner our server asked us if we were ready for dessert. Very frustrating because you could clearly tell our plate were near clean still. Next was the issues with the food in an hour long sink experience only 3 of the 20 plus meats came by and at one point we asked our server if she could send over the serloin guy she asked us how we wants it cooks and said she would send him over. 15 minutes later the guy came by with the last couple slices of meat and they were well done. We asked for our dessert finally and she be out us our check before our dessert. Right when we got the dessert she asked if she could take our check. Me and my girlfriend felt as though she was trying to rush is out of the place. This place needs a serious overhaul in service if they expect to keep customers.

Two ordered the grilled chicken, one ordered the bisque and one ordered chicken and French fries! These orders took soooo long to get to the table that most of us didn't want the food when it arrived!!! Both of the chicken breast were so overcooked that you couldn't cut through it with a serrated knife!!! My friend described her grilled chicken as chicken jerky!!!! We sent her order back and asked that it be removed from the bill!!!  The greeter/waiter/bartender/cook did his best, but it just wasn't enough to make up for the horrible food and lack of service.

Even with a discount I wouldn't return, but if you're still interested the offer info is on their website.  We arrived around 9:30p and waited briefly to be seated because they only had 2 sections that they were seating.  After about 15 minutes of waiting and no greeting from anyone, the waiter for our section greets the last table that had just been seated to take their orders.  Really??  Aware of our displeasure, the manager approaches and apologizes, introducing our server, Marcio (the same server who was just at the previously mentioned table),  who will take good care of you.   After giving Marcio our order for the Meat Rodizio, he tells us to start with the salad bar area.  (We wouldn't see Marcio again for a very long time.)  There is absolutely nothing notable about on the salad bar, nothing that looks tempting, or overly fresh.  Everything is just alright.  We return to our table to find the meat gaucho scene bleak.  Over the next 20 minutes we would be offered 3 things: fresh pineapple, sirloin, and ham.  Really??  I've been to Brazilian Churrascarias before and I've never seen so little action.  Enter the scene Jeremy, our savior, who immediately jumps into action.  He asks what meats we have tried and would like to try. We tell him that we have only had 3 things, to which he says,  I'm gonna go make a note on the board for you, so we can get you guys a taste of everything.   Thank you sweet baby Jesus!  Jeremy opens the flood gates, and just like that meat starts flowing into our room.  For the rest of the night Jeremy would be the only person keeping an eye on our glasses, making sure we got food and beverage refills.  Thank you Jeremy!  Food quality is highly inconsistent, ranging anywhere from a (-3) to 4.  The first piece of picanha we tried was more dehydrated, shriveled, and overcooked than a slice of beef jerky.  Once we asked for rare they did step it up and deliver a tasty piece that I would rate at a 4.  Their chicken legs had no flavor, pork loin was dull.  The good: bacon wrapped turkey, picanha (after adjustment), lamb (inconsistent, but had 1 good piece), and tri-tip (shocking because I normally don't care that much for it, but very flavorful & juicy).  Ok, we're donzo.  Check please.  Marcio!  There you are!  We were certain that he had gone home or something.  I really hope that they split tips there because our  would be server  gave us absolutely no face time.    At most Churrascarias the gauchos are personable and communicative.  There is a total disconnect here.  Once, one of the gauchos did, to my surprise, ask us if there was anything that we would like to try.  The atmosphere is non-existent.  As we strolled to our car my boyfriend made a comment that summed it all up.  He said,  Pampas is an Olive Garden in the world of Churrascarias.

There are some other brazilian bbq places where the meats just all start tasting the same. Another favorite was the bacon wrapped turkey.

I remember liking the one that wasn't with parmesan . The service here was excellent. We brought our own wine. When we called, they said the corkage fee was $15, but it turned out to be $10.

Came with unlimited shrimp which was at times were overly cooked. In fact the first batch we had was leaving a bad first impression, but we like shrimp and it kept getting better.   The meat and the shrimp was always making it to our table. Hardly ever had to wait around. The only thing I have to say is that it would be nice if I had a say in where they cut the meat. The outer parts are usually the more well done section and the inner parts were of course not. The moment we say yes they just go straight to cutting the area of their choosing. Thankfully my friend like the opposite so we can just switch if we needed to.  Some times some of the meats felt like it came out a way over cooked. like the chipotle chicken, I bet it would have been great had it not been so crispy.

DO NOT come here unless you want to kill time and have $$ to throw away. I regret not checking the Yelp.com reviews before coming here. We came for lunch on 2/13/16 because of a discount voucher we bought from TIX4TONIGHT (half-price booth similar to those in NYC). Two of us both ordered the all you can eat meat ($21) lunch option.  My history: Been to Fogo de Chao in NYC, Baltimore, and San Francisco multiple times, once at Texas de Brazil in Chicago.  Very familiar and love the Brazilian steakhouses in general.   1. Service: Arrived at 1pm on Saturday 2/13, seated at 1:10pm, but waitress Ashley did not show up until 1:20pm. Drinks (2 glasses of water) arrived at 1:30pm. The restaurant was less than half full at this time, so I don't understand why it took this long.  2. Meat carving service: The meat carvers (only 3 guys for 20-30 tables) are bringing out meats every 7-10 minutes, compared to every 1-2 minute at other Brazilian steakhouses. We spent 80% of the 1.5 hours meal time waiting for meats to come by. I finally spoke up and alerted the manager, who said she will send meats our way. The carvers did show up within the next 10 minutes, but with an attitude.   3. Meat quality: The meat carvers are not educated about how to slice the steak (especially Picante, the top sirloin), and cut out 1/2  slices that are very chewy. Out of the 8 steak slices, 2 are blood-dripping raw (I asked for medium rare), 2 have chewy tendons (taste cheap), 2 are fibrous tri-tips (I spit them out after chewing for a while) and only 2 are edible. When I asked the carver to return with medium rare steak, he complained why I am not eating the raw piece, which has a pool of blood sitting on top of it. Please see attached photo.  4. Meat selection: we were promised 7 meat options according to the menu, here is what we actually saw during 1.5 hours of waiting: -chicken wrapped with bacon is overcooked and dry. Bacon is crispy though. -pork sausage is good but on the salty side, so I couldn't eat more than 2 bites without drinking water. -Picante, the signature Brazilian steak top-sirloin, only came to our table 2 times, after the manager got involved. One piece was amazingly tender and the other piece is surprisingly bloody raw (see my photo). Quality control is poor.  -Pork loin is the best and most edible part of our meal. Juicy and tender. Only came to our table two times though.  -Tri-tip steak is fibrous and chewy, so I finally spit it out after chewing on it for 2 minutes.  -grilled pineapple is not ripe and sour.  In summary, even with the discount we had, this is NOT worth the money. I hope you read the reviews here and decide to go elsewhere. It is definitely not worth $21+tip+tax per person for lunch.

We ordered the salad bar, meats (5-7 different meat) and seafood (only shrimp) and while ordering the 2 hours of unlimited drinks, the server said, please be patient on the drinks as we do not have a bartender and so he would also be making our drinks. We just ordered a pitcher of mimosas to make is easy on the server. The mimosas was about 3/4 orange juice and very little champagne. The salad bar was a joke, the food was all cold (suppose to be hot). Most plates were dirty and the soup was marked wrong. There were some cheese rolls that was so hard. All of the meat that came around was either under cooked or over cooked. The shrimp was still shelled and awful. The server had to be chased down several times. My wife observed them reheating most of the food. We contacted the manager who really showed no concern. It was as though this was not the first time this had happen.

Came with a friend on a Saturday afternoon.  We each had vouchers for a  lunch, just the basic meats, which was fine by me.  I love me some all you can eat anything!  And Brazilian bbq?  What's not to love?  We were pretty excited when we arrived that there were lots of tables open (pretty sure we just beat the lunch rush as it was almost 1:00 when we arrived) so we thought we'd be seated immediately, if not soon.  We were told 15 minutes to wait.  Why?  More than 75% of the place was free and there were more than enough employees walking around chit chatting.  Several were obviously servers that were standing in the corner talking, hostesses standing at the front with menus but not seating anyone.  So we wait.  Moments later, a small party comes in stating they have reservations for 1:00 for 5 people.  I overhear the hostess tell them that they had to wait 20-25 minutes for their table to be ready.  REALLY?  What was the point of making the reservation?  1:30 rolls around and they finally seat us. (30 minutes later.) The party with reservations gets seated 15 minutes after we do in the same section that hardly had anyone seated.  SUCKS SO FAR.  (For them too, I'm sure.)  As we're seated, the hostess tells us our server will be there in a moment to take our drink orders.  20 minutes later, our server walks by as he's saying  Hi, I'll be right back to take your drink order  as his voice fades with him walking away.  We get no chance to say anything.  All we wanted was water.  Come on.  I say screw it, let's start at the salad bar.  (Oh yeah, none of the meat has come to our table yet, 30 minutes seated with no service?) however we see the guys walking out of the kitchen and taking it to another section of the restaurant that seems to be getting much more attention than the side we were on.)  We make it back from the salad bar, and still no water.  Server arrives another 10 minutes later to take our drink order.  2 waters.  Another 10 minutes and the first meat guy comes around.  2 pieces of sirloin (one for my friend, one for me, wasn't bad at all) was all get got until the next guy came around 10 minutes later.  (It took our server another 15 minutes to bring us the waters from taking the order.)  Overall, we arrive before 1:00 and don't leave until about 3:50.  One glass of water (server never refilled) and 6 pcs. of meat for each of us.  Averaged 15-20 minutes to get a piece of meat.  To top it off?  I had a voucher which the server insisted he knew which to take as he does it all the time with these vouchers.  Now, our vouchers were attached to our bus tour vouchers.  I asked him if he was sure he had the right one.  Dude gave me a look of attitude and said  Look, I do this all the time, don't worry about it.   MISTAKE.  I go outside where our tour bus stop is (Thank you lord that is was right there) and as I try to get on, the guide tells me I have the wrong vouchers.  So I go back to the restaurant.  Hostess ignores me as she stands there looking at a piece of paper.  Another hostess walks up and fianlly asks if she can help me.  I let her know that the server took the wrong voucher and I couldn't get on my tour bus.  She says she'll speak with the server and check with him.  She comes back with an attitude, as if I'd accused them of something totally crazy, telling me that the server was sure he took the right one.  Our server never came out and the hostess was about to just brush it off.  I asked to speak to a supervisor who FINALLY came out.  I believe her name was HEATHER, or something close to it.  I gave her the same details, she came back with the same answer.  The server took the right voucher.  I asked to see the voucher he took, and after rolling her eyes and sighing outloud, she said hold on and walked away.  She came out this time with the actual receipt and vouchers the server took.  Low and behold!  SERVER TOOK THE WRONG VOUCHER.  I told her the one she had was the one I needed.  She insisted STILL that she had the correct one.  I had to finally take a stand and get a firm with her and said  LOOK!  And pointed to the print, details, etc. to prove that they took the wrong one.  When she finally realized it, she looked at me again, rolled her eyes, then still had the nerve to ask me,  So this is the one you need?   WTF?!?!?!  I tell her yes please, she tears off the voucher off the receipt and as I'm doing to same to give her the correct one for her records, she snatches it out of my had, doesn't say another word, and walks away.

Their salad bar is puny but that could be forgivable since it isn't the main attraction anyway. Right away, however, our waiter seemed to be on a pressure-tactic to try and upgrade us to some surf-n-turf mumbojumbo that we had no interest in. When we politely declined, he seemed to visibly dismiss us but didn't miss a beat to try and slickly pressure us into buying bottled water. I'm not a fan of tap water anyway, so it was no big deal, but he definitely came off as a used car sales rep-level slimy.  The gauchos came around once and....that was about it. We were really early for dinner, right at 5, and there weren't many other people there, so it was really puzzling to me as to why they couldn't be found. I wanted more of the steak and fatty meats, but they only ones that came by a second time were the dry chicken guys and the underwhelming sausage dudes. Since we had a show to catch at 630, we really couldn't linger anyway.   All in all, I wouldn't come back here - the meat was too rare, the service was lacking, the cold food was bland without enough variety, and I wasn't satisfied. The one standout was the Brazilian lemonade - we couldn't get enough.  Oh yeah - they will come by and try and take a picture of you before you leave,  Complimentary souvenir postcard.  Once you pay your bill they'll show you 2 large printouts that are $25 each or 2 for $30 as a 'Vegas keepsake.' Uh...what happened to the whole gratis part?

My party of 11 had reservations for Pampas....even so, it took them more than 45 minutes to get us our table.  Most waiters look forward to large parties - lots of potential for tips - however ours avoided us.  The menu has some good offerings on it.  However, because it had taken so long to seat us and our waiter was not being attentive, most of us ordered the salad bar because we were running short on time.  Irritated that the majority of the party was not ordering the most expensive thing on the menu (keep in mind, we were a group of well dressed, well-to-do people), the waiter began collecting up rodizio plates from the table as loud as he possibly could, as if being passive-aggressive would put more time on the clock for us.  We then pointed out that he'd failed to take the meal orders from three of the people in our party, which irritated him further.  He mistakenly collected a rodizio plate from one of the party who ordered the meat rodizio (the all you can eat meat) and when the diner informed him that he shouldn't have taken the plate away, argued with the diner for 5 minutes before checking what he himself had written down for the meal order.  The food at the salad bar was decent - good variety and mostly well done, and does a good job as light fare.  The people who were most disappointed were those who ordered the all-you-can-eat meat.  The menu said it was a  neverending parade of meats .  In actuality, they were not served for 20 minutes while the rest of us were eating from the bar, and neither was anybody else in the restaurant.  The manager stopped by to ask if people were getting their meats, to which we told him no, not in the past 20 minutes.  I'm guessing he chewed out the wait staff, because a slow trickle of the rotiserrie spear holding waiters slowly started making their rounds, albeit it was far from being a  neverending parade  and all of the servers appeared sour and grouchy that they were being made to work.  Most would come by, cut off one small slice, and walk off leaving my friends sitting there trying to flag them down for more.  As for the meat itself?  Nothing special.  Most of it was overcooked.  The bacon wrapped turkey was good, but how often is bacon-wrapped anything bad?  Overall it was very disappointing for the price tag, and the people who were most satisfied were those who just got the $19 salad bar because they were either not hungry or in a rush to leave.  Funnily enough, they have red and green markers to be put on the table, green to sign servers to bring more meat, red to tell them that you're full.  The diners in my party that ordered the all you can eat meat finished dinner hungry and turning the markers to red just so that we could collect our checks and continue with our night.  As for the rude waiter?  He was delinquent in refilling our drink orders (and 11 people on their way to a club can order a lot of drinks) to the point that on more than one occasion members of my party walked to the bar to order drinks.  When we asked him to split our checks, he became visibly irritated with us.....lets see, a group of 11 people, four couples and some single guys, why would separate checks with the mandatory gratuity added NOT make sense?  Not many 28-30 year olds pay for 10 friends to eat at an expensive restaurant like this...  The waiter then went around the table and argued with every one of us about our drink orders (which wasn't much thanks to him being AWOL).  15 minutes later, he tosses down the drink bill and basically said he made no effort to try to break it up.  In the end, the one thing our waiter did right was not add gratuity to both the food bill and the drink bill.  Everybody in my party of 11 gave him exactly what he earned and deserved for his tip: $0.00 .  If you're looking for all you can eat and quality, go to the buffet at the MGM Grand or the Aria.  If you're looking for bad service, go to Dick's Last Resort - their bad service is at least entertaining and their prices are more reasonable (and quality of food is sadly comparable).

Waiters walked everywhere carrying large slices of meat.  We order the two dishes, their salmon and rib eye.   I have to say their salmon sauce is amazing, it was sweet, tangy and a touch of sour.

Sure, Pampas tried (and did a fine job of) masking the tasteless fish with a wonderful sauce.   But that farmed, previously frozen salmon meat is still crap.

When we checked in, the waitress said she had some 6:45 reservations to sit still. ADVICE: reserve a time 30 min prior to when you expect to be sat.   Our servers were happy and prideful in their food. Imola and Ambur kept making sure we were taking care of with drinks and meat. A+  We ordered the surf and turf. We got a platter of shrimp, clams, and salmon. The meat was incredible. They had flank steak, top sirloin, and chicken. Some were rapped in bacon. Everything was juicy and delicious.   4/5 because of the reservation deception. Use a groupon.

And although we have to work during our spring break, we decided, to do something completely different and fun for our Tuesday night dinner, something we can't ever do with the kids. We became tourists in our own town with dinner and a show. We scored 8:30 pm tickets to Zombie Burlesque through Vegas.com which offered dinner at either Pampas Churrascaria or the Italian restaurant across from the V theater where the show would be. I went on Yelp beforehand of course, and read the unimpressive reviews of Pampas. We briefly considered the Italian place, but because we're living dangerously and hadn't done Brazilian in a long time, we thought we would give it a try, Yelp reviews be damned.   Well the rating lived up to its hype, or rather non-hype. For us, we believe the worst part was the pokey service. When we finally did get a server to acknowledge us, we then had to go over the fine print of what the show tickets included in terms of the dinner. We would only get a choice of an entrée: beef, chicken or fish which came with run of the mill sides. And the only alcohol included was the sangria, house beer, and their cocktail concoction, which I can't remember what it's called, but, looked completely labor intensive for the gal making it. We upgraded to the buffet for $10 more and the $20 per person alcohol ticket for an hour of well drinks. Fuck it! We're on spring break.   The buffet was decent. It offered an array of cheese, veggies and other sides. The meat merry-go-round was just okay. The tri-tip piece that I had was dry, which made it difficult for me to cut into. My husband appeared to have received a juicer piece of tri and he still had issues cutting the meat. His contribution to this review is simply: this place needs sharper knives to cut the meat.  So yeah, I got nothing else. This place is just adequate and tailored to the tourists. If you're in Vegas as a tourist, you don't generally come for the food. You come to gamble, see the shows and drink yourself stupid. If you're looking for a really good Brazilian place, this place isn't it.

We all waited 10 minutes between servings too.

I asked my server about it and he said that they had taken it off of the menu. I posted a tip about it and a rude supporter of this place (the company's fake Yelp account probably) told me to get my facts straight. (I later called and inquired about the change. I was told that it was still on the menu. I'm not sure what he got out of lying but whatever.)  I walked to the hostess and asked to speak with the manager. The manager came over after about 5 minutes. I told her that it was like my 6th time eating there and the experiences and food are both getting worse.

Both were nice and strong and tasted good.  -the rolls were light and fluffy and delicious (we ate a lot of these to get our money's worth) -the dessert, a chocolate mousse pie was yummy!

We had to ask for them to send over the meat carvers more than once. -the surf part of our meal included a few dry mussels, several shrimp that were not deveined properly (seriously gross!), some fairly tasty salmon, and some mushy white fish. -the meat was not tasty at all. The beef was fatty and hard to cut, and the pork and chicken were dry. The only good meat that I had was the sausage.  -the side dish buffet was sparse and many dishes were empty. My friend never got any potatoes, as they were never replenished.

I purchased the lunch deal which included two all-you-can-eat meals of meat, seafood and salad bar, plus one alcoholic drink per person and one dessert to share. It ended up being a great deal!  We checked out the salad bar first and I was slightly disappointed by it. I was expecting more of a green salad bar and less of the pre-made pasta salads. The Caesar salad was soggy, which seemed odd considering that the restaurant had just opened less than 30 minutes before. The standouts of the salad bar for me were the garlic mashed potatoes and chicken noodle soup, which I found helped to give me a stomach a relaxing break from all the delicious meats.   And speaking of the meats, those steaks were amazing! Both the tri-tip and the top sirloin were melt-in-your-mouth delicious! As others have mentioned, they're rather salty but I, for one, have a salty tooth so I was in heaven! I loved having the meat carved right at our table and being able to have as much as I could fit in my tiny stomach.   Unfortunately, the other meat was mainly pig-based and I don't eat pig so I skipped the ham, pork loin  and even the bacon-wrapped chicken. I tried a chicken leg but didn't care for it. Besides, the steaks were too good to bother with anything else.   Thanks to Yelp, I read how amazing Pampas' grilled pineapple was and I knew to request some. I think that they usually bring it by your table but after 30 minutes, we had yet to see any. We asked our waitress and she notified the kitchen to bring it out. It was so sweet and delicious and balanced the rest of our meal perfectly.   Our meal ended with a choice of one of four desserts. I'm probably an odd one out here but none of the four choices (cheesecake, chocolate cake, flan and tiramisu) appealed to me. I'm more of a pie or ice cream kind of girl. I would have chosen the chocolate cake, even though I'm not a huge chocolate fan, but my boyfriend wanted to try the flan so I let him have it.

Give yourself more time to get over here if you are seeing a show. Traffic was hell on a busy Saturday night 9/21/13. We walked from the Mirage to Planet Hollywood where this restaurant is. It took so much time. Our reservations were for 9:30 but they give you a window of 15 minutes either way. By the time we finally got there with all the people walking the strip to the construction it was 9:50pm. We were seated with no problem. I took one look at the menu. The voucher was for the meat rodizio they come and bring around. Instead of paying $43 dollars the voucher would give it to us for $24.95. The menu tells you what kind of meat. Being the only thing I had seen from what they bring is the steak it made no sense to pay that price for just bringing me steak and taking a little bit of rice and pasta from the buffet bar. So I declined eating that. I went and picked the Grilled Peito De frango $27. The waiter talks to me like I am a little kid and tells me that this isn't part of the voucher. I obviously can read my voucher and I tell him I know this, you don't have to tell me twice but I am not paying to eat a round of meat that the will come around and the only thing that catches my eyes are the steak.. Nope.. So I finally get my chicken. While my boyfriend gets his buffet bar fill and waits for the meat. My chicken is so tough to cut through. The mashed potatoes were cold. They obviously just sit out there. We tell them my potatoes are cold. They don't take my plate but give me another wallop of potatoes that are only a tiny bit warmer. Ugh my stomach hurts at this point. Where was the vegetables that the menu states with this. I saw something underneath my chicken. It was not edible. I tried to make the most of the meal so that I could go back to my hotel without being upset. The waiter was ok after that for the most part. He asked if I wanted to take it with me.

However, the experience was still less than stellar and of 3 Brazillian steakhouses we have been to, this is definitely in the bottom third.   First, they don't bother to tell you they charge for water - they just put it on your bill. We ordered drinks and they still brought water, then they surreptitiously added it to the bill with no notice or explantion!  This would be consumer fraud in California, but in Nevada, where their clientele are mainly tourists, I guess they can get away with it.   The buffet was barely warm, this just after opening and the bread old (maybe yesterday's leftovers?).  Meat service was very lacking, and they seated us at the wrong end of the restaurant (near the bar).  Meat selection was minimal with an almost complete lack of variety, and we were at the end of the carving route, so by the time the meat got to us, we only got the inside cuts near the skewers with no crust.  The meat was cold, tough, had no seasoning, and requests were ignored.  When a sausage skewer came out, I asked for 3 pieces, but was ignored - only got 2. Meat service was slow, coming by only every 10-15 minutes.  They still come by with a hard sell to take and sell a photo or two - pretty  irritating.  In short, if you live in the Bay Area, don't bother.  There is no need to go to Las Vegas to eat Brazillian Barbeque.  Fogo in the bay area is a much better value with better food, even if twice the cost.  Miracle Mile has several restaurants, and next time, we will go elsewhere.", "Date": "2017-01-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Mo", "ReviewID": "3wAgrplqeXufNmzKyw27ag", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Great price! Great food! Great atmosphere!  So, we set out to find breakfast, but since we (as most folks visiting vegas do) had woken up quite late, we ended up roaming into this Brazilian buffet. We were pretty early for lunch, so the place was pretty empty, but that didn't stop the food from making its way to our table.  The sides at the walk up buffet were pretty diverse, everything from capreze salad to falafels. The olives and feta were fantastic! If there was anything missing, it was mashed potatoes.  The meats were equally good. I wasn't a fan of the not-spicy chicken, but the ham served with pineapple was great and the big slices of beef were yummy as well. If you have never been to a Brazillian buffet, be warned, their stuff is always extremely salty. I think this is just the style they make it in. It will taste very different from the slab-o-prime-rib at the buffet down the walkway.  Best part? Never ending food for under $15 per person!

The appetizers on the bar were pretty good except for their being so much cranberry in the dishes- this isn't necessary in every cold dish you prepare.

Also, they barely came around to your table.

Ultimately the meat is what really differentiates the star status for these to for me. TdB just seemed fresher and better cooked. Most of my meats were overcooked at Pampas here. At TdB the meat guys (is that what they are called? Eh I'll go with it) at least tell you if meat is cooked med. rare, med. or well done. At Pampas i was left guessing with most of them seeming well done, while I am a medium rare fan. The only thing cooked proper to me was Pampas's Sirloin.

Let me say that the food was okay...not great but good. The Buffett was stocked, fresh, and had a few tasty options. The meat was served promptly but some of it was not cooked properly. For example, undercooked bacon wrapped around a few of the steaks choices. My major issue was with the service or lack there of. I was very disappointed to find that we were supposed to squeeze 20 people into a tiny room where the chairs literally touched each other. Because it was my wedding night, my family decided to ask for a manager in hopes that perhaps they could add another table or suggest another area that can actually fit 20 people. The manager asked to speak with me (middle-aged Hispanic man) and when I told him our issue with seating he replied with  well you only paid $150 for the room.   Nevermind that we paid over $60 per head for everyone I guess... After I picked my jaw up off the floor from hearing this, I calmly walked away and let him know that I would contact my wedding Coordinator to pass on his response. He shrugged and never came back to check on us. We were assigned one server who was obviously overwhelmed because my husband along with several party guests had to wait nearly 45 minutes for refills of our drinks. But it seemed all the alcoholic drinks that certain guests ordered kept flowing. I was very disappointed in how everything played out. We made the best of it though.

Pampas did not have any wait time and despite its 3 1/2 star review, we thought, how could you go wrong with Brazilian? Well, let me count the ways...  1. They stuck us in the far back corner of the room, which I was ok with at first since  we had a 15 month old with us, but when the meat guys (not sure what they're called) systematically avoided our table, that was strike 1 for us... 2. Ok, so the meat guys finally made it to our table, but guess which one kept coming to our table again and again. The LAMB guy. I mean, really. If we wanted lamb we would have gone to a Mediterranean restaurant or something. I mean, bring on the skirt steak and top sirloin. Enough with the lamb.  3. Except they didn't have any skirt steak. They did have something they called filet mignon, but to be honest, I've never had filet mignon that tasted like beef jerky.  4. But the REAL deal breaker for us...I mean the one that almost made us dine and dash, was their pan de quejio, if that's even what it was. They tasted more like dry biscuits from a fried chicken shop than those delightful little bursts of warm cheesiness we were anticipating. Pampas, we can forgive you for the filet mignon.

They were all amazing and obviously have become experts with  working what they have.   The first impression upon checking in for our reservation-utter confusion.  I'm not quite sure what was wrong with their reservation system, but it was definitely not working properly OR it just sucked.  It seemed that there was some confusion of who to seat first, the folks that were on the walk-in waiting list or the folks that had booked a reservation.  My husband and I had a reservation, but still waited 30 minutes to be sat at a table, and then waited another 15 minutes before being approached by a server.  The manager who was very visible just seemed to be busily walking back and forth but didn't appear to really do anything.  For those who have never had the pleasure of dining at a Brazilian Steakhouse, the way it usually works is there's a salad bar full of side dishes and then waiters come around and carve freshly cooked meats at your table.  When our drink orders were finally taken we approached the salad bar.  Most of the items looked extremely thirsty like it had been sitting out for a while, and this place was super busy!  The lettuce for the salad wasn't wilted but still looked extremely dry.  Mashed potatoes had that yellowish  skin  formed on it.  The one form of salami that they had tasted borderline bad.  The cheese plate was all poured together with no care what-so-ever.  The Brazilian cheese rolls which most Brazilian Steakhouses are famous for were dry and tasteless.  When the meat (the whole reason, in my opinion, that you pay almost $50 a person for) finally arrived to the table it was a total disappointment.  The first dish was garlic sirloin.  It was so tough I couldn't cut it into pieces small enough to eat.  My husband's piece was horribly rare and also tough.  The next dish was leg of lamb which is the whole reason I took my husband here.  It literally resembled shoe leather, and like the last dish could barely be cut with a steak knife.  I really really hate to complain while dining at a restaurant especially while on vacation, but this was just a horrible experience that I was about to pay top dollar for.  When our waiter came to check on us, we showed him the state of the meat that we received thus far.  He, of course, apologized profusely and set out to make things right for us.  He got us clean plates and called over some waiters with different cuts of meat one of which said that he saw the leg of lamb we complained about, and agreed that there was no excuse for that.  The new meats were still only fair, to be honest, but at that point, I just wanted out of there.  We paid our full bill and left.  The manager at this point was nowhere to be found, so whether or not anyone told him about our complaints is anyone's guess.  My husband and I have been to this type of restaurant several times in several states.  None of them have had meats of such poor quality, in my opinion.  The whole point of going to a Brazilian Steakhouse is because you want well-prepared meats.  Someone needs to tell whoever is in charge of purchasing the meat in this restaurant to aim a little higher.

In short, it's a decent alternative for hungry carnivores who are tired of buffets.  If you haven't been to a churrascaria, it's an all you can eat affair where there's a nice salad bar and a few side dishes - but instead of a buffet, the staff bring large skewers of meat around to your table.  Most places have a signal (like a coaster) that says  more please  or  I'm still chewing .  I guess I'm spoiled by Fogo de Chao.  I have visited the DC location several times and it has become a favorite stop for me and many of my traveling buddies.  Pampas is the same concept, except executed with value in mind.  Said differently, Target and ShopKo are both variety stores, but I'm pretty sure most people would much rather go to Target if given a choice.  Pampas is the ShopKo here - a little less quality, a little cheaper, and a lower atmosphere factor.  The meat is OK - certainly comparable to the stuff served at Outback or any other chain restaurant and is a little over seasoned.  The preparation is good, but not great.  The salad bar was pretty fresh and had a reasonable variety.  We were seated quickly and reasonably well attended to by the friendly staff.  We had to wait a bit on some of the meats, but not enough to complain about it.  The convenient location is nice, as are the short waits.  I'm on the fence with the stars here.  Certainly, I could go 3 in terms of overall quality and experience, but it's the value quotient here that leaves me cold.  If you can score this for $25 - it's an easy 3-star experience.  If you get suckered in for $40, then it's a bust down to two stars.", "Date": "2010-04-25", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Nadia", "ReviewID": "9ujQlripf9Sa21PCn5pZ_Q", "Overall": "1", "Content": "This place suck they are cheating you don't go there.

Salad/side bar is decent, though I'd recommend staying away from the rice and mashed potatoes trying to steal stomach space from the steaks and meats.   Meats includes tri tip roast, pork loin, pork tenderloin, bacon wrapped filet mignon, lamb, bacon wrapped chicken breast, salmon, smoked ham, mussels, shrimp, grilled pineapple, and grilled chicken thighs. Our favorites were definitely the pork dishes, all seasoned and cooked very well. The beef and chicken dishes fell a bit flat: beef tended to be under seasoned, chicken was dry. Aside from the mussels that were extremely overcooked, the seafood was very good. The one annoying thing was the frequency of the dishes offered to us. We probably were offered smoked ham 4 times, whereas the lamb only came around once, and portions were tiny (though the lamb was also an underseasoned, overcooked disappointment).

Pretty decent Brazilian all-you-can-eat buffet with unlimited meats brought to your table ($36.99 pp for dinner) but don't expect as wide of a buffet selection as one of the more established Brazilian BBQ places like Fogo de Chao or Texas de Brazil in other cities.   Overall the meats brought to the table were pretty good: - Pork loin - excellent, perfectly cooked, delicious seasoning - Lamb - very tasty. I HATE LAMB, but loved this one because it tasted great and wasn't gamey. That says a lot. - Chicken - regular and spicy - very moist and tasty - Beef ribs - good but a bit fatty. Ribless. - Sirloin steak - good but wished it had a bit more flavor. - Flank steak - only one I didn't like. Overcooked and lacked any flavor - Filet mignon chunk wrapped in bacon - good flavor w/the bacon but the filet was overcooked - Turkey sausage - was alright - Ham and pineapple - didn't try  Examples of the non-meat buffet offerings: - smoked salmon - some beef stew thing - roasted potatoes - some veggie - salads (caesar and regular) - bread rolls - rice - variety of other sides  The place is very nice and elegant inside with very friendly wait staff who came by to asked us how we were doing different times. It wasn't that crowded so service was overall attentive altho spotty at certain times. Simple but effective system: you have a card that is green on one side and red on the other. When you want meat to come to your table, flip to green. When you are full or want a break, turn it to red.  Apparently you can get a discounted rate for this place by getting ~50% off price tickets (check out Tix4Tonight for $19.99 for the usual $36.99 dinner meat buffet) or free by attending one of those timeshare presentations. Also there are signs in the Planet Hollywood casino that say mention the sign and you'll get $5 off or something like that.  Bottom line: If you love meat, this place should make you pretty happy.

As a Brazilian, used to going to this kind of restaurant my whole life, I don't think I've ever felt so uncomfortable and disappointed seating on a dining table before. We were hungry, looking forward to the yummy recipes of Brazilian cuisine and it was Vegas for Christ's sake! We made reservations for New Years Day at 10PM. Got there and were seated right away. Within minutes, the waiter comes to our table and takes our drink order. We had a voucher and were immediately told what we could and could not eat (no steaks or seafoods). He also said that we had 15 minutes to eat because the kitchen was closing soon (this was never said when we made the reservation for 10PM).   When telling him that I'd like to upgrade and eat all that i wanted, he didn't know what to answer but stuck with  you can't . I found that odd. I was willing to pay whatever it took to eat what they offered (premium meats and seafood), so I felt disappointed with it. Out of the 15 minute deadline he gave us to eat, 10 minutes went by and no meat was brought to our table (waiters were walking right by with the meat skewers to another section of the restaurant). I decided to inquire about it with the manager at the time. I explained to her that we were given 15 minutes to eat but still haven't gotten any meat at our table. She was surprised of such deadline given by our waiter, and worked on getting meat on our table. She said we could eat as much as we want, no hurry. She was nice and tried to take care of everything.  When the meat finally made it to our table (chicken thighs, breast, top sirloin, etc..), the quality was pretty bad. Dry, blend, as if it had been reheated a few times. We tried a couple bites and left the rest on the plates. I went on to try all other cuts of meat, but the quality was consistent throughout. I figured I'd cancel the seafood upgrade as I expected it would be just as bad. The salad bar was good, and that was mostly what we ate (and the cheese breads, those were yummy. But I can make those at home lol). To those who don't know, the main feature of Brazilian steak houses, is the constant flow of different cuts and types of meat that are brought to the tables. Unfortunately, that night, we didn't enjoy that.  The service was regretful the entire night. Our waiter offered to take our plates several times when we were still obviously working on it. He seemed untrained and not too professional. He even took a bite (with his hands) from something in the salad bar as he was walking away from us. Probably thought no one would see it. lol Then wandered around the restaurant chewing what he ate. He also made a plate for himself in the middle of service. Haha.  We wondered if that was just a regular evening of service there, or if it was just due to us having a voucher. We will never know because we are never  going back. Lol If we knew that one of our vacation dinner experiences would be so miserable, we would have definitely chosen somewhere else to eat, with voucher or not.

She gave us several options on how to reserve and pay for our private room.  The private room did not disappoint, in fact the entire comfortable vibe of the room fit our group of seventeen perfectly. Pampas served us several different types and cuts for meat. The bacon wrapped chicken was our first serving, but only our first. We enjoyed steak, lamb, and more pork. Everyone enjoyed their meal. Our VP is a little picky about his wines. So picky that he is known to send glasses back. At our dinner he liked the wine so much he ordered a total of three bottles for the entire table.

However, we were sat in this large room with at ton of tables and other patrons.  Everyone is going to the salad area to get food so it feels really busy.

Service Horrible service, unwilling to cater to their customers - We asked for the store manager, and a chef who claimed to be the manager came out and explained to our party that Pampas Churrascaria does not care for their customers and their loyalty. Also, they don't really welcome Groupon users, especially the ones, he stated, that come weekly apparently. The restaurant was nearly empty at the time we went since it was a weekday, yet we were rudely dismissed by one of the passing servers after being seated. Thankfully, our designated server was welcoming and attentive... or maybe it seemed so compared to all the other employees we came across before finally being seated.  Food Lunch meat choices are limited to dry chicken, dry&tough picanha, other dry beef choices, sausages & pork (the last two of which I did not try). Seafood was okay. Seafood unlike the meats is ordered through the server, and surprisingly we did not have any problem at all. It included salmon, shark, scallops, and shrimp. Salad bar had a small, but good variety of salads, pasta salads, soups, bread, etc. The pastas were dried up and looked like they had been sitting there for a good amount of time.  Ambiance When I first stepped into the restaurant, I had a good feeling about the place. It is next to the Todai in the Miracle Mile Shops, good location, and decorated well as all or most restaurants on the strip are.

My friend and I actually purchased another Groupon to come again while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive. Mistake! I asked Groupon for a refund right after we left!  At such a reasonable price, we wanted to give the place a try, but what a disappointment.

(See the other Yelp reviews to explain the discount.) Having arrived more than thirty minutes late due to a logistics problem* our party was concerned that we would not have enough time to eat or worse, lose our reservation completely. Upon arrival we were assured by the friendly hostesses that we could be fed and on our way in under an hour. Casting furtive glances at one another, our party of five decided to take a chance and be seated.  I'm glad we did so.  Our waitress, Michelle, did an extraordinary job of corralling a tireless squadron of saber-rattling picanha peddlers (passadores) who were all too willing to slice you off another portion of their allotted meat assignment (rodizio). Every few minutes, a wave of sizzling meat arrived tableside just begging that we claw at it with our individually administered  meat tongs . Those looking to capitalize on the premium offerings are advised to skip the chicken and turkey wrapped bacon and double up on the pinchana, pineapple ham and Brazilian sausage.  Also worth mentioning was the side bar that came with the Rodizio specials. Highlights include the spicy black beans and sausage, the caprese (wish it had fresh basil instead of dried) and the fried bananas.  I don't recommend going for the Surf and Turf Rodizio, however. An apparent afterthought, the strangely presented fish (platter/tile/metal sheet?) was ice cold, tasteless and uninviting. A shame really as I was totally looking forward to the bacon wrapped scallops. After making a mention of this to our server she was deeply apologetic and took it off our bill.  Overall the meal was of three star quality, but garners a fourth star overall because of the impeccable service we received. Thanks to hostess' ability to seat us within five minute (despite completely missing our reservation) and Michelle's vigilant watch over our table, we were not only able to enjoy a large meal in under an hour, but also had enough time to have dessert. I myself enjoyed rich cappuccino while a friend enjoyed the flan.  * Top Tip: If you're arriving here by taxi, do not tell your driver to simply drop you off at Planet Hollywood. Doing so will result in you having to traverse a near half mile length of casino floor rooms AND almost the entire stretch of Miracle Mile Shops.

This review has nothing to do with the food. We ended up cancelling our order and leaving this place because of the poor offensive service.   Dear management,    I took my family of 9 this past Sunday to your restaurant for the first time. None of us have ever been to Pampas and none of us have ever gone to a Brazilian steak house. We heard about Brazilian steak houses and how they work but for our first experience at Pampas it made us never want to try Pamas or any other Brazilian restaurant.  We did not get to eat the food mainly because of the service.     We waited 25 minutes to be seated and that's expected but then we waited another 15 to 20 minutes for anyone to even come to take out drink orders. We were served water a few minutes after being sat and that was fine but when my sister in law asked for straws, the woman that served the water answered impolitely and then brought back a handful of bar straws (after I had just watched her handling a tab) those straws had no paper or covering on them aside from us being uneasy and most of us not wanting to even drink from those straws because someone else has already touched them, the table was dirty with dried crusted food and one of the tables was loose from the top of the table where the food is placed. Usually a table gets lose from the legs.     After this, someone finally came to take our orders. she explained the 2 big options and them proceeded to ask if we wanted the option with sea food or the option with only meat. We were all confused because we were given menus with several other options but she was only giving us 2 options. After disputing this with her and expressing our confusion she told us the reason why she 'suggested  only those 2 options was because if we try to share we would get charged. This is understandable but she then proceeded to tell us that we were being watched by cameras and  that whom ever was watching us will have her charge for an additional meal if we are  caught  sharing. Mind you, One person on the table was deathly allergic to sea food and is also a vegetarian so this person was going to order from the buffet. We had 3 children on the table, one whom does not eat sea and none of these 3 kids would have to even order a 30 dollar all you can eat meal because....they are kids and kids don't eat that much and finally another person on the table does not eat red meat.     This waitress pushed a 2 options that only 3 people on this table would have/wanted to order and then offended the entire table by telling us we were being watched so  no sharing  as if we were a class of 10 year olds. After she took our orders she let us know that there was going to be a one dollar charge for the waters we received. We did not ask for water. It was served to us without her asking.     After she left, we all looked at each other and decided to leave. I canceled the order with the waitress. She insisted she had already put in our drink orders but by this time we were all offended. I did not tell her the reason because it was just to much. We just wanted to get out of there. This was our Fathers day for our dad. He always wanted to try eating at a Churrascaria but now he feels he will never go to one because of this experience.     Most of us know how buffets and brunches work. You pay per person. We went in knowing that this place would work the same way (from what we heard how a Brazilian steak house works). We had no intentions of  cheating  and only ordering one big 30 dollar all you can eat meat and sea food. We are not cheap and we are not crooks but according to your waitress and the comments she made about us being watched I guess we look like the type that would do such a thing.

Perhaps my tastebuds have gotten picky as I've gotten older, but this place was a downer.  I wasn't expecting imported steak or aged meats, but for a Brazilian churrascaria, I'd like some flavor (if you meats don't cut it) please.  We came here the day prior to Ash Wednesday.  For all of you non-Catholics, you may be more familiar with other terms this day goes by, like  Fat Tuesday and Mardi Gras  or  Carnival.   So, prior to our 40-days of abstinence, we were expecting a real meal.  This place did not deliver.  Even with the 40% discount that http://www.tix4tonight.com/ provided, $22 for all-you-can-eat (discounted from $36) plus $15 average drinks is not a deal at all.    Nope, I'm not kidding about $15 cocktails.  And, nope, it's not in a bigger glass.  It comes in your regular, everyday lowball.  I've clubbed in Vegas, LA, NYC, London, etc., $15 is a  total rip-off.  I would have been better off sitting on a slot machine on the casino floor with my $15 (and served a free double shot of whiskey and d.coke) and had a better time.  And, to add to the hysteria, if you opt for wine, they give you this big silly, plastic wine bottle to order off of.  As we all know, every true churrascaria will pass on the chicken and all the other filler crap that they try to feed you in the beginning.  So, I could not honestly critique those items.  However, all the (should have been) good stuff (i.e. beef and lamb) was medium to done because of all the re-cooking.  This was not at all pleasing to me, as I prefer medium-rare for these meats.  The petite fillet was fair, in flavoring and in seasoning.  However, the lamb was not fresh and you could taste it.  The pork was on the dry side.  And, I could have used a little more blood on my ribeye.  With that, I couldn't begin to imagine paying full price.  But if you must experience it, check out tix4tonight.com before you go.

I can't say the same for paying full price here, but to each his own I suppose. I've been to a few different brazillian steakhouses so this was by no means a unique experience, but it was a mostly pleasant one.  The interior is fairly well decorated, and the location is convenient-- right in the middle of the M shops. Great if you are planning on shopping afterwords, or if like me, you just like the atmosphere and are too cheap to shop at stores like these. The staff was accommodating and seated us without incident.  The salad items aren't bad but some are better than others. The tortellini is ok, the olives are tasty, the artichoke is a nice touch, but the garbanzo salad had a pretty weird flavor. It was just the end of happy hour so I was happy to have a Stella Artois for 3.50.  Then of course there's the actual meat. The kobe fish was different and well seasoned but a bit dry. The shrimp didn't taste much different from any shrimp I've had elsewhere-- I honestly prefer the stuff you can get at Cajun themed restaurants.   There was some  spicy chicken  but it didn't seem particularly spicy to me-- although it was delicate and fell easily off the skewer. Most of the meat servers are pretty friendly and will likely give you a double portion of meat if you let them know you really like what they're serving. The lamb was delicate and cooked to a perfect medium rare. It came with a sweet and tangy balsamic sauce that complimented it well. The garlic sirloin was solid, but the seasoned sirloin came out pretty dry and appeared to have been cooked well done. The tri-tip was delectably juicy ( I happen to be a huge fan of tri-tip) but the top sirloin was rather dry.   When the bill came and it was obvious how much we had saved with the groupon, we had no gripes. However, I don't think I would have been as pleased if we had paid full price for the food. The quality of the cuts seems up to par but too many of their offerings were overcooked, and I just wasn't that blown away by the quality here. This place is no Fogo de Chao, but if you have a groupon or other discount deal, it's not a waste of your time to try them out.

Suffice it to say we were very pleased with the service, variety and general deliciousness that greeted us.    My first impression of Pampas was style over substance; in that regard I was very much mistaken. Yes, it is a fancy restaurant with a matching feel, however it is also warm, welcoming and infused with an overall pleasant feel. Our waiter Dave was a consummate professional. Our drinks were never empty and were strong and crisp. Despite the fact we had only an hour open bar we were met with no delays and were given precisely as much as we could drink in that time. His service was beyond reproach. What's more the servers and managers were also very on the ball, asking us consistently how we were enjoying our meal and if everything was to our satisfaction. The service here really was five star quality.  As for the food: superb! The salad bar was fully stocked with more pasta, vegetables and sides than you could ask for. You could very easily and happily indulge only in the sides and still have a very satisfying, delicious meal without fault. However, to do so would be to miss out on the main event of truly sensational, high quality meats brought and served at your table. My particularly favourite was the perfectly cooked Sirloin and yummy spicy chicken. But all the meats were divine and well worth the extra money, if only for the variety and unlimited quantity you receive. My only fear is that this place was somewhat wasted on me due to my small appetite. But if you're a big eaten then I can promise this place will not dissapoint.   Fair warning though: Pampas (as you might expect considering the unlimited nature and remarkable quantity) does come with a hefty price tag. It cost us $130 for the two of us (and that was including the discount). Expect to pay big.  Overall, a truly sumptuous night out that I'll definitely repeat next time I'm in Vegas. Well worth the money.

We were trying to find a sports bar as it was Sunday at 1pm and we wanted wings and football.  We walked the entire Miracle Mile shopping center and the two main sports bars, Blondie's and PBR Rock Bar, were packed.  We were really hungry by this time, so we stopped at Pampas.  We were promptly seated at the very front/patio area of the restaurant.  The salad bar is all the way in the BACK of the restaurant.  My husband is disabled and walks with crutches, so I was already planning my strategy to get his plate and my plate all the way across the restaurant.  Our server arrived, noticed the crutches, and immediately asked if we would be ordering the salad bar and, if so, would we like to be seated closer?  This scored major points with me.  They actually opened a section for us to sit in, and we had it all to ourselves.  We both ordered the surf and turf and hit the salad bar.  The only other churrascaria I have been to is Fogo de Chao, so that is where I will base my comparison.  The salad bar at Pampas is about 1/4 of the size of the one at Fogo.  I actually found this preferable as I remember being completely overwhelmed at Fogo.  The Pampas salad bar had a nice selection - jicama and citrus salad, Brazilian coleslaw, pasta salads, potato salads, hearts of palm salad and several others.  For a more traditional salad, there was an option of romaine or spring mix.  The romaine was dark green, crisp and fresh and the spring mix was equally fresh - not soggy at all.  All of the basic salad toppings were available and several dressing options were available.  My only complaint about the salad bar would be that the fresh mozzarella balls (presented with cherry tomatoes) were very bland.  On to the main reason we were there...MEAT!  By the time I returned from the salad bar, the sirloin guy had already been by and had left a delicious slice of perfectly cooked, medium rare meat on my plate.  It was seasoned just right and very tasty.  I ended up eating A LOT of that sirloin.  There was also bacon-wrapped turkey (can't go wrong with anything wrapped in bacon!), Brazilian sausage, ham, BBQ chicken, BBQ pork and even pineapple!  All of the meat was well seasoned and well cooked.    I had noticed one of the menu options was a skirt steak with chimichurri.  I asked our server if I could get a side of chimichurri and she was happy to oblige.  She let me know it would take a few minutes because they make it fresh for each order.  It came out a couple minutes later and was delicious!    The  surf  part of the surf and turf was ok.  When you order the surf and turf they bring a platter of seafood to the table and let you know you can order more of anything.  The inital platter includes grilled shrimp, scallops, salmon and the fresh catch of the day (not sure what it was - I think it was grouper, which I don't care for).  The shrimp were small but tasty, the salmon was well cooked and made even better by the provided soy ginger glaze.  I didn't try the catch of the day.  The scallops were very small and not very good....can't quite put my finger on it, but I ate one and didn't want anymore.  Overall, I would say save a few dollars and just get the meat.  There was a woman who was around during our entire visit...I believe she was either the owner or the general manager.  She stopped by our table to make sure we were satisfied and talked to us a little about the restaurant.  I commented on the chimichurri and she stated that everything is made fresh, in house.  In fact, I had noticed a window into the kitchen while I was at the salad bar where I could see people making all of the salad bar items.  Anyway, I always appreciate when I am in a restaurant and the owner or manager is interested enough in making sure the guests are happy that they stop by and chat.  When we checked in to our hotel, the concierge gave us two $5 off coupons for Pampas.  I am sure we will be using those before we leave Vegas at the end of the week.  At $19.99 for the meat-only option, its hard to beat for lunch.  If you go for dinner, it is more than double the price ($41.95 for meat only) but they add tenderloin, tri-tip beef, and lamb.

I think one of the highlights for my fiancé and I was the fried pineapple. IT WAS AMAZING!!! Best eaten while it was still warm or hot.

Second, the main room arrangement is really uncomfortable, we were very close to the tables next to us and the servers seemed contracted and tight, made the experience tight and rushed. Third, the meats were OK. The picanha was the only worthy meat cut other than that everything tasted like beef shoulder. The seafood was nasty and I was not able to hold my salmon down. Never got the chance to try the mussels or shrimp after I got sick but my mother tasted them and she said it was not pleasing at all and that she did not understand the surf and turf concept with is NOT brazilian.

You can order stand alone items off their cart, which I've never done before.  I've always tried their rodizio, specifically the meat rodizio.  If you order the meat rodizio, it's similar to an all-you-can eat, although it's not specified as one.    Essentially, you have unlimited access to the salad bar.  The salad bar has plenty of options including every kind of  Brazilian salad under the sun, it seems.  My favorite is the artichoke heart salad.  They also have many appetizer items like cheese bread and fried bananas.  The fried bananas are definitely worth trying.  At your table, the waiters come around your table w/ cuts of meat cooked on a skewer and slice you as many pieces as you choose.  You get to sample steaks, tri-tips, bbq pork, chicken wrapped in bacon, grilled chicken pieces, and sausages.  The bbq pork is especially well marinated and tasty.    I also love that Pampas purposely serves the steak to you rare to medium rare depending on the cut.  In effect, you can't say how you want your steak done -- they just serve it to you how they think you should have it, how it should be eaten.  As a foodie, I believe steak should be eaten rare to medium rare anyway (so you can discern the quality of the cut of meat), so I'm fine w/ that.  But all you ppl who do not know how to eat steak (i.e. you request it well done), don't select the steak option when it comes around.  Hahaha... sorry if I sound mean, but that's how Pampas does it.   Regarding the price, I think it's significantly cheaper to have lunch there than dinner.  Lunch rodizio was only ~$20 per person but dinner was nearly $50 per person.  Granted, I've only had dinner at the Pampas in Palo Alto, CA and not at this one in Vegas, it is of note.

I knew of the one in PA and had always wanted to try it.  I didn't even know of this location until I entered the Miracle Mile shops inside Planet Hollywood.  I was primed and ready to go on the meat-fest extravaganza.  $39 for the meat only and $50 for the meat and seafood, both of which included cold salad bar visits.  Feeling adventurous, I super-sized to include the seafood, just out of curiosity.  The salad bar was OK, they had some cold and hot vegetable dishes as well as smoked salmon and salad stuff.  Once the food started arriving, I made sure only to try one piece of each meat and no more.  Unfortunately, when eating that much meat, I realized that it was hard to appreciate and taste them individually flavor wise.  In the interest of saving your stomach, I recommend you avoid the brazilian sausage which came out dry, the lamb which tasted a little too game-ish, and the turkey wrapped in bacon, wasn't too impressive.  The seafood consisted of scallops wrapped in bacon, grilled salmon, tempura battered cod, and shrimps with a butter sauce.  The salamon was dry and the cod's flavor was masked by the deep frying.  I'd only recommend the shrimp out of all the four and better to order them as a skewer than doing the rodizio.  Make sure not to order the coconaut mojito on their cocktail menu.  Coconaut and mint don't go together despite what our server enthusiastic words.  I had the red wine sangria which was okay...it wasn't as fruity as I have had before in Spanish tapas restaurants.

He said no, and that they charged for each bottle. We asked how much it was for each bottle, and he said he didn't know and would go find out. There were two things wrong with this situation:      1. How the hell do you not know how much a bottle of water costs? As a server, you should know your menu inside and out.        2. It took him fifteen minutes to get back to us with a price, which meant we went fifteen minutes without anything to drink, because we had all finished our drinks as well as the water.   0 stars for service.   As for the food, bleh. Everything was salty and overcooked. They came by our table at least fifteen times with sausage, but we were only offered their beef items a few times. As for their salad bar, they had a lot of choices, but none of them really worth while. I will say that their chimichurri sauce was pretty good. Actually, it was the highlight of the meal. It was the only thing that was actually good.   I would never set foot in this place again. HORRIBLE service, and sub par food.

Maybe I have been spoiled with Fogo de Chao and Gaucho's Village in LA. But i have also been to smaller brazilian steakhouses and experienced much better.

I don't know if it was because it was late at during the night but it wasn't like the place was empty and people were continuing to come in through out our stay. The 'gaucho's' took FOREVER to come out. I mean, they were nowhere in sight.  They finally came by with some filet mignon with parmesan cheese. It was good but nothing special. Interesting flavor but nothing to rave about. They then brought some ham which the bf said was good. I had some brazilian sausage that was good. They kept bringing out the filet mignon and i wanted some picanha, some lamb.... something they did not bring until 45 minutes- 1 hour that we had been there. By that time, appetite was gone. Still tried some of the picanha but it was meh. They also did not ask how we wanted it (medium- medium rare, etc) which is not a requirement but I have always been asked that at churrascarias. Pan de queijo was pretty good, and since the meat took so long, we filled up on that. Good, but not worth a 40+ dollar meal for cheese bread!

My date and I waited 10 min for our reservation. Patiently waiting to meet or server, the $25 open bar drink package, 1st drink, came to our table 20 min later and one was incorrect. We recurve our water which had a film of grease on the top level. Our first round of meat I asked for rare and was given well done. I waited an additional 10 min for the meat and correct temperate. We order the Surf & Turf meal option which came with small peel and eat shrimp, tilapia, as very hard piece of Mahi Mahi and muscles. I must say the muscles were good, I ordered another order which NEVER came. Due to the slow service we were only able to order 2 drinks on the package. I asked to speak to the manager and all that was offered was for me to return tomorrow night or when I'd like to for compensation. I shared that with all of this competition in Vegas and the fact I usually go to Fogo de Chao which happens to be right around the corner (even more of a reason to on top of your restaurant) I did not wish to return but since we didn't finish our meals and had to leave to catch our show it would be nice to have this meal comped for our dining experience. Corporate, working the flood that evening, explained I would have to go back to Groupon to try to get a refund. I spoke with two other tables around me and they too said they are having  an awful  experience. When I spoke with the woman from corporate before leaving I shared how upset I was, the fact that nothing was able to be done for me at that moment was absolutely ridiculous. I pulled two random servers aside and asked if this is how the restaurant is and they said yes. I shared my apologies to them for having to work in such an establishment and they too responded,  yes, this place isn't the greatest . When I asked who was about corporate that was there and that id like their info as we are now running late for our show, she said  you'll have to wait a moment  and rolled her eyes at me. We waited per her request until she was finished with 3 other servers at a computer. She came back with the Managing Partner's business care whom I have every intentions on calling. Being s local and having a culinary degree, family owned restaurants, many many friends in the casino host business and a food critic I would never recommend this establishment when Fogo de Chao is around the corner.   What is advertised on Groupon and what actually shows up is false advertisement since nothing looked the way they had  advertised it.   So at the end of the day, we had to wait after making a reservation, dirty glasses and water, over cooked meat, paid $99 for two which includes surf & turf (never came with a second round of muscles I ordered). unlimited drinks for an hour (only was brought 2 drinks - one of which i had to track down someone to have them make me a 2nd drink, and dessert (which we were never offered).  I can go on and on about this place about how unhappy I was. Not only did Pampas ruin my date night with a terrible dinner, they also robbed me of my $99 for the meal since I wasn't told nothing could be done for me and I'd have to contact Groupon.   I have every intention of contacting the Managing Partner, Groupon, and Corporate.

Nearly every step of the visit was off, starting with our seating. We had 4 PM reservations, as much to enjoy the food and its unique presentation as to be able to beat any Friday night crowd. When we approached the exterior host/hostess stand, we found no one there, which was fine as there wasn't a line, only us. We walked into the interior host/hostess stand and waited for someone. Again, no staff member. When we were  greeted,  the staffer acted annoyed, as if we'd disturbed her by making reservations AND arriving for them. Despite absolutely no one else waiting to be seated and literally tens of open tables, we were told to wait. We waited for 15 minutes for no apparent reason and the person who seated us was only slightly more friendly than the first staff member.   Our waiter was nice, which was a pleasant change, but other than bringing our drinks and clearing plates (not particularly efficiently, by the way), he really did nothing more. In the area in which I live, the two Brazilian steakhouses offer much more engaged wait staff. This is important because Pampas literally prints what you should tip on the bill. Not the usual 15%, 20%, 25% amounts, but a literal  You're bill is X. The tip is X.  As someone who wait tables to pay off her grad school debt, I'm a damn good tipper - WHEN I GET SERVICE. Our waiter, who treated us no differently than the other tables in our section, took a drink order, refilled our water (also, don't drink water at this place - there's a  Water Conservation Fee  that isn't revealed until you get your bill. While I agree that the Southwest is close to water crisis mode, pulling this without informing customers is just shady) and only sometimes cleared plates from a crowded two top. When we wanted to leave, we waited 35 minutes for the bill. For this  service,  we had to give the guy $33.   We had a Groupon that, according to both Groupon and Pampas websites, was the equivalent of $142 in food and beverage. The  Surf and Turf  option was to include eight meat selections, four seafood options and  more than 50 hot and cold side and salad choices,   according to the Groupon description. Um, no. As to the salad and sides, the only way anyone is getting to fifty is by making roughly 30 odd salads with various toppings or considering plain mashed potatoes one option and mashed potatoes with butter or gravy another. While I did not count every hot or cold station on the buffet/bar, my guess is that there are less than 20 stands, but that these contain selections with multiple items, like an antipasti station with a variety of meats, cheeses and vegetables. That does not  50+  options make.  On to what these folks believe is worthy of paying close to $60 a head to eat: the meat (and in this case, the seafood). Have you ever been to very run-of-the-mill Asian buffet? If the answer is yes, you've had the equivalent of the salmon, Tilapia and mussels served by Pampas. Every piece tasted over-sauced and looked, tasted and smelled like it was cooked before well we arrived - exactly like a strip mall buffet. Those buffets, however, don't start at $38 per person and tend to be much more satisfying.  The meats, you ask? Only slightly better than the seafood, with the exception of the top sirloin, which was wonderfully flavored and extremely tender for that type of cut. The chicken drumstick I got was so overcooked, the leg bone actually shattered (and scattered, much to my chagrin) when I cut into it. The meat looked desiccated, which was a bad start for the meat course. In the two plus hours we were in the restaurant, only five of the selections (one of which was grilled pineapple) came to the table. Again, this wasn't any different for anyone else in our section, given the immense amount of time we had to observe other tables while we waited for the bill.   The offer included dessert - frozen cheesecake, purchased in bulk - and two cocktails. I opted for a Caipirinha, the national cocktail of Brazil, an excellent aperitif. While well-made, it was far more boozy than I had hoped, especially since I would be driving. My companion, who had been drinking the night, opted to have a soda. While I get that the deal included two COCKTAILS, we thought it was silly that our waiter didn't switch out the cheaper soft drink for the never ordered second cocktail.  On top of all slowness, weird charges and marginal food, an attractive woman with an accent as beautiful as the rest of her, rolls a heavily stocked bar cart throug the restaurant, slinging drinks (possibly at an upcharge from the bar) tableside. While I enjoy a hustle, especially one with style, was odd at 4:45 PM, in a sparsely seated room. Additionally, while the woman - again, she was lovely and the only staffer with a personality - didn't reek of desperation, the ploy did.

We purchased a voucher on Travelzoo that was a 2 for 1 deal.  An $86 meal became $43.  After reading some of the reviews on Yelp, I was not looking forward to this dinner.  Prior to purchasing the voucher, I had read some pretty favorable reviews. That was 2 months ago.  I checked Yelp this afternoon before we went to dinner, and I found some reviews that trashed the place.   Even though I am giving this place 3 stars,  I started out wanting to give 5 stars.  The food, in a word, was SPECTACULAR.  I don't know what restaurant some of these people were eating at, but both my wife and I found this place great. The salad bar was fantastic.  Lots of vegetables such as Chinese broccoli and pickled veggies.   Caesar salad was surprisingly good.    If you are a meat eater, you can eat yourself silly.  I especially liked the spicy chicken and a top sirloin that was a special of the night.    Before I get to my downgrades, some advice.   Don't bother purchasing a 2 for 1 voucher ahead of time from Travelzoo or any other site. We could not walk more than 50 yards without someone offering a 2 for 1 coupon on the strip.  Heck, there was some dude wearing some Brazilian bird outfit not more  than 50 yards from the restaurant inside the Miracle Mile mall adjacent to the Planet Hollywood hotel that was offering a 2 for 1 discount coupon.    Again, this would have been a 5 star review if not for a couple of things that our waiter did that were, let's say, disappointing.  When we sat down, he asked us if we wanted any drinks.  We said  no;  however, we wanted water.  He asked if we wanted flat or sparkling and we said flat.  Not too long after came a couple of bottles of Pelligrino.  About a half hour into the meal, my wife asked me   are we being charged for this water?    I brought the waiter over and I asked him this question, and he said  yes.   I said  not a chance.   He got defensive and I said that nothing was mentioned about charging for the water, and our waiter, to his credit, told us that he would take the water off the bill. By the way, the cost of these two LARGE bottles of Pelligrino was $30.  One could conclude that this is how this place makes its money.   The second thing that the waiter did was bring our final bill and it totaled almost $20.  Mind you, we had not purchased any extra sides and no drinks.  Our expectation was that we would receive a bill for the sales tax which should have been between $6.80 and $8.60.  I explained this to the waiter. He left to take care of it, and came back w/o any changes.  Instead, a 5 min explanation as to why the bill was correct. I was very calm and explained that he was incorrect and why.  He then realized that he got our voucher mixed up with another promotion involving the purchase of show tix.  He brought the check back  and everything was corrected.   One more thing. Another reviewer trashed the place because he was part of a large party and was annoyed that the restaurant added a tip for everyone based upon the full cost of the meal BEFORE the Groupon discount.  He felt that the tip should be based upon the discounted Groupon price. This is incorrect as the waiter is being penalized.

We sat at a table right by where all the servers walk and there were points where the meat guys walked right by without even a glance over even though we had green up. We waited 20 minutes before the first one came and we were almost done with our entire plate of salad and sides.

Keeping consistency is definitely the key.  Service: When I first came, my group and I were seated fairly fast.

The servers were very nice to all of us and catered to our needs often. At the end, I just really wanted some water or a refill on my soda so I ended up asking this lady server for a refill. The next thing you know, I get denied. She stated that she had to tend to the bill and won't be able to refill any drinks. In the end, I just left the restaurant with a bad taste in my mouth because of this lady. She was very rude. I understand she's busy and all but she has other servers she can ask to give me my refill.This person really needs to control her attitude when she's under stress as it was fairly busy.

So our meal was basically buy one get one free as the price of 1 person is about $68 I believe, but we each paid half. So after looking at the Yelp reviews and pictures we were excited.  Due to putting the incorrect address in my GPS we ended up being 30 minutes late. Once I discovered my mistake which was after 17 minutes off setting off my friend called the restaurant to notify them. When the staff member picked up we were quickly put on hold and left on hold....for 30 minutes, the entire time it took to drive over from the incorrect location we were at.  I even called them from my phone when we were about 10 minutes away and also was put on hold.  When we arrived at the restaurant, we told them we had tried to call them to give them a heads up that we would be 30mins late for our reservation but we had been placed on a hold and still were. The waitress was shocked and marched us to the desk to show the hostess. With us standing there they didn't even bat an eyelid and somehow got it mixed up that we were part of a table already seated. After telling this waitress again what happened, she apologized which the other hostess didn't and gave us both a complimentary drink.  After being seated, we got some food from the buffet and waited for the meat with our green circle clearly visible. After 4 rounds, it seemed our table was invisible as we kept getting passed over...this happened for 20 minutes. To get their attention my friend lifted the green circle up in her hand and after 3 minutes suddenly we had 3 servers at our table.  One of the servers tried to make a joke about it & I basically said she had to go this far to get some meat service at this table & I don't see how that is funny! After that we got served as we should have but the experience was already down the toilet by then.   I am glad I didn't pay full price as our experience was not worth the price in my opinion. If it wasn't for the waitress who apologized & gave us complimentary drinks for the awful service I wouldn't have tipped at all.  The food wasn't all that great, Fago de Chao is better in my opinion. The meat wasn't seasoned enough for my friend and I and the salad bar was  smaller than I had expected with less variation for the price. I will not be coming here again.

If it wasn't for the voucher, I would have screamed bloody murder.  Anyway, coming here on weekend during lunch hour, we only saw a few tables occupied which we didn't think it was a good sign. But we went ahead and decided to give it a try before reaching any conclusion. After we were seated, I looked around and noticed nobody was really enjoying their food, and not a smile in sight (including the staff.)   After we got salad and soup from the salad bar, we must have waited like 10 -15 min before two staff came out with skewers of meat. We were starving but the look of the meat didn't even look that good to us. The meat were cold, under seasoned, and very rare. And that was the way it was throughout the rest of lunch. At Texas de Brazil or Fogo de Chaos, they always re-roasted the meat when they brought it back to the kitchen. At Pampas, they rarely (no punt intended) do that so all you got cold, under seasoned, under cooked meat. Funny thing we noticed that for a meat joint, most of the customers (including myself) kept requesting grilled shrimp because it was the only thing considered good to eat.  Now let's talk about service. Since this place is like dead, they kinda copied that feeling into their service. Even though the place wasn't crowded at all, it took the waitress a freaking long time to refill my soda. Everything we asked for something, it took her so long to get it even though she wasn't busy. How do I know she wasn't busy???? Well, because she would go back behind the bar counter, right in front my my view, to either count tips, put on make up, check and text somebody from her phone. Our waitress didn't come by often either, so you can imagined everything took a long time for them to bring it to us. Even though she wasn't rude and got what we asked for (eventually), the lack of care, service, and depressing environment just made everything worse.  For those that visit Vegas and think this Pampas is good, you gotta spend some taxi money (about $15)  and visit Fogo de Chaos or Texas de Brazil. The food quality that you get at either place will make the taxi fare worth it.

As far as Brazilian steak houses go this is my one and only experience. My experience is also limited to just the buffet and meat experience. So let's take it from there!  Starting off, the place looks nice. Dimly lit and fits the mood of a relaxed dinner. The dining room is well spaced and even when full you can move around freely. The waiters and waitresses have always been friendly and accommodating. Even joking and being friendly, that's always something I'll consider good customer service. Let's take it away to the food and start with the salad bar which is where I'm knocking off a star. The variety here is nice. You have fruit salads, make your own salad, deep fried bananas to biscuits and soups. Some light pasta salads, everything very light. The problem being is some of the items are hit and miss. Hot items aren't always hot, potatoes can be under seasoned or straight up bland. I've had an item or toe where I can easily say I wouldn't want to try it again. Luckily majority of these items are good with only one or two stinkers.  The meat has always been the rave of the place for me. I've never had an experience with any sort of over salting, over seasoning or over cooking. The meat is always prepared and as a fan of filet mignon I will say theirs is excellent. I was even treated to a personal filet mignon dish after I went there for graduation. They weren't serving the item yet but created some for us. If that's not a great gesture then I don't know what is.  Not having tried much else item wise I can't recommend or sway you from other menu items. I still recommend the place for a nice sit down meal for a special occasion.

Today we were walking among the crowds and took a turn into Planet Hollywood Hotel. It's a really cool place and the have a very nice selection of restaurants. Many of the restaurants were chains that I have been to already and we felt like trying something new so we popped into Pampas Brazilian Grille. The place is really classy and clean and we were seated right away. Our table was right outside in one of the major walkways, near the Harmon entrance so we were able to do some people-watching while we enjoyed our Caipirinha (which were made perfectly!) it's kind of like a mojito but I think it has a bit more of a kick.  Our server Nicole was very polite and we asked her for a recommendation as we had never been to this type of Brazilian Grille before. Nicole gave us a great description of the way they work and suggested we try the Surf & Turf  Rodizio . It's an all you can eat salad bar, with an endless supply of seafood and a variety of meats that they bring around to your table on these big skewers. The waiters actually carve off pieces for you right at your table so it's pretty entertaining too. There are a variety of skewered meats that include sirloin, pork loin, sausage and a bacon wrapped chicken that was amazing. My favorite was the skewered ham and the shaved pineapple. Really tasty.  Okay so it's a Brazilian Grille..the parade of meats is incredible but their salad bar totally rocks too! Marinated artichokes, roasted peppers, sliced portabello mushrooms, pasta salad with olives and sliced salami, lamb stew, an assortment of rices, mashed potatoes, seasoned chicken, and tons of other soups and traditional salad bar items.

The problem is, it's a tiny buffet with limited sides, I only saw 5 or 6 meats (no where close to 12), and it was a constant fight to get the few meat selections to your table which caused frustration...not relaxation. Additionally, the BOGO coupon was BOGUS! We did get it half off but you couldn't buy the basic buffet, you had to upgrade to add the grilled shrimp and a beverage which makes your total $4.50 cheaper than the price of the regular buffet. Doesn't sound like Payless BOGO sale to me. Other than the gimmicks, the few grilled meats we had were actually tastey. The ham and steak were really good! If you did not prefer rare meat, you had to request it separately which caused more waiting and frustration. There wasn't a single side that I had that was amazing. Just different cold salads.

When my meal arrived, however, it actually came with not a bagel, but a MINI bagel.  I'm not exaggerating, the bagel was approximately the same width as the sliced romaine tomato. Considering it was a $10 breakfast, I expected a normal-sized bagel.  Or at the very least, it would have been nice for our server to warn me in advance.

Service: The last time I was here, we sat for over 7 minutes to start out our meal before we had a  gaucho  come over ready to carve out some meat...and they aren't that personable like in some other places, kind of robotic.  The salad bar doesn't have much...throw a couple hearts of palm on my plate and I'm done...not going to fill up on fettuccini alfredo.  The best cut of meat for me was the leg of lamb and the balsamic vinegar mix they use to sauce it over, but of course that came around once over the course of an hour and we were sitting in the middle of the room.  The filet mignon is bacon wrapped and too salty and extremely tough for what is supposed to be the most tender cut of meat...and I hope you like it medium-well because that's all they had.

So I can't tell you  what the place is like for dinner. But I have been there for lunch going into dinner and the only difference we noticed was a couple of extra meats we didn't care for.  Anyway. Even if we had to pay the full price of $20 for lunch (meat only) we would still go very week like we do. However we bought a dozen $25 off $37.50 or more coupons with our air miles from restaurant.com. This makes our bill $16.22 w/ tax for the both of us. With a $6 tip it's $22 for an excellent all you can eat Brazilian lunch. You can't get a buffet on the strip for this amount, nor most fast food joints in the mall.  Amazon locals is an excellent site you ought to get emails from. They often have coupons for sale for this place. They often cost $4 for the $25 coupon. Which still would make your bill only $20.22 for two of you.  I believe the restaurant is in a crap location, this is why it has to do so many promotions in many areas. It's in the mile of shops at Planet Hollywood, kind of at the back of a row of restaurants on the north side of the mall  by the rainstorm mess of a show.  Now to the food. Salad bar is at the back of the restaurant and kinda tight, but the food is awesome. My boyfriend loved the marinated carrots. I love the large meatball sized mozzerella balls and salads. The meats come out on skewers from the staff who are often and many. I would say there are seven or eight different things on a regular rotation; pineapple, bacon wrapped chicken & sausage, flank steak, BBQ pork, sirloin steak (my favorite) chicken legs (pretty large too) and I think there's something else that I can't remember. Any way, we have never been disappointed with the food. If the meat comes out too raw, just ask your server to get it cooked more. I hate it when I read on here that the food came out to rare. I like it that way, but my boyfriend doesn't, so we always ask for a better cooked piece of the steak and they come right back with it. Just ask people, don't wine if you can't be bothered to open your mouth and ask.  I think this place goes through a tonn of staff as we have been 10 weeks in a row and never had the same wait person twice. However, they are all good and attentive.

Will start with the scam, have been to Pampas a couple of years ago, it was great.  So recently a groupon came up for sale and I figured I'd buy it.  $100 for $50 in food, how could I go wrong?  Well I found out.  Pampas artificially inflates their retail prices and then offers discounts through various venues (Ticket for tonight, groupon, people handing out flyers in the mall) to make people think they are getting a good deal.  So in the end you just end up paying about what you'd pay at any other restaurant....as long as you use your coupon (I feel for the poor people that don't utilize some sort of coupon at Pampas).   For example: Seafood buffet - $48 Meat buffet - $44  In Vegas you can find far better values for much less than that, or even splurge and eat somewhere higher end for about the same price.  So I guess with Groupon I expect to get some sort of bargain or deal, and I felt like i didn't here.  So I feel like I've been taken advantage of.  Thus I must rate this place as two stars.  The food is really quite good.  The meat tastes delicious and the salad bar is quite good.  The service is OK, the waiter was actually the same guy for both visits.

To me this is as simple of an explanation that I can give to my thoughts on Pampas Churrascaria.  To an extent, it pains me to say this because the meat was, as advertised, very good.  The rest of the experience, however, was not up to par with, to be honest, my lowest expectation.  The strategy of this business is very simple.  Get people in the door, get them fed, get them out not caring about repeat business because we are all tourists anyways.  They are the classic coupon/gimmick facility mimicking the stores that mark their prices up merely so they can offer a discount and people feel like they are getting a deal.  You won't.  I guarantee that, even by Vegas standards, you will pay more then what it is worth despite your 2-1 coupon that somebody handed you on the strip, or your Groupon, or one of the other discounts that every single person in line seemed to have.    I'll admit that it is tempting.  We fell for it.  After reading several varying accounts we decided to give it a chance but afterwards we were left with this feeling of good meats completely void of any type of atmosphere which is really quite sad.  Now to be fair, Pampas does receive some accolades from me and I'll explain them here.    First, the hostess station was commendable.  Despite being extremely busy they were able to accommodate us earlier then our reservation when we asked.  They also handled a very heavy workload filled with very needy people quite well.  People were jumping the line to ask questions, hovering around them, not an easy work environment for a restaurant employee and I felt they did an excellent job.  The question remains, however, why is the structure set up in this way to allow a line with roughly 20 people in it just to check in.  Secondly, the cuts of meat were delicious and they seemed to come around often enough.  If you are in the food industry and you have good food that should account for a star.  We also had the Tiramisu for dessert which was a great portion and very tasty.  Outside of these two bright spots however, this place could not live up to even the mildest of expectations.  The buffet portion of the restaurant was incredibly lackluster and required a very treacherous journey dodging other patrons, trays and workers.  We ordered the surf and turf which was a complete waste and hardly touched given that fact.  The service was efficient but lacked any sort of outward personality whatsoever.  Actually, that is not true, our server absolutely reeked of  I'm too good for my job  which inevitably led to much of the bad experience.  There were no facial expressions, no changing of tone of voice, it was as if it was a very apathetic robot was asking us if we wanted to start with water and then jabbing us with a $6 bottle which is another story.  I would rather deal with a server forgetting our food, screwing up our order, etc if their is a little bit of humanism behind it then deal with some arrogant facade.  Maybe he was having a bad day, I know that happens but for some reason I really doubt that was the case.  All in all, if you are considering this place that means you are in Vegas.  And if you are in Vegas you have virtually an unlimited variety of establishments serving up amazing food.  It's not worth your time and it  is not worth your money, and when they are so many other worthy options all around you make sure you don't waster either of those things here.", "Date": "2015-03-07", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Alice Lee", "ReviewID": "uZKaKuDsJcSkm8N8E1VEqQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "We enjoyed a great dinner with our friends from Germany.

This was the most HORRIBLE dining experience that I've ever had. It is no surprise that they continue to move their business page!  Our cousins invited us to stay with them at their fantastic timeshare and we wanted to show our appreciation by taking them to a nice dinner. Earlier that day, I passed by Pampas and a hostess in front of the restaurant offered me a coupon. It was a buy one get one free offer. I inquired about the price difference between lunch and dinner, and asked that she explain what we should expect to get based on when what time we decide to eat. She told me that the main difference is that there would be 7 meat selections for lunch and 12 meat selections for dinner. We were all excited and looking forward to our dinner. It was a Sunday night, and we were sat right away. This was the only good thing about this night, no wait for a table, but here's the rest of our infuriating debacle. Our server, Karen, approached us a few minutes after we were sat and brought over a couple of large bottles of water. The caps were already removed from the bottle so we assumed that they were trying to be creative in how they served water. We later found out that they CHARGED US FOR WATER! We did not request water to begin with. She should have informed us that there was a charge before placing it on our table. Also, as you'll see on the attached picture that the bottle states that sparkling water is served in the bottle, but it was NOT sparkling at all. I asked Karen why they charged for water that we did not ask for and she said  Nevada has the worst tap water in all of United States, and I would never drink it.  Obviously, her reply did not answer my question as to why they charge for something prior to informing us of the charge. BTW, it a minimal charge, but it's the principle.  Karen informed us that our coupon required that we buy a drink, so she goes on to suggest that we buy a pitcher of some type of alcoholic drink. I asked her if the coupon required that the drink be an alcoholic drink, and her response was  Well this is Vegas!  WTH!!! This girl was so irritating. I informed her that my husband did not drink alcohol, and she gave us a look of disgust. What she doesn't know is that it was only my husband who preferred non-alcoholic drinks, and the remaining 3 people would have ordered a bunch of alcoholic drinks, but the look that she gave automatically triggered us to order only the cheapest non-alcoholic drinks (with refills). Time to eat! The salad bar was horrible. It looked as if workers do not check the area to keep it clean. Totally looked unsanitary. Karen claimed there were 40 different types of food at the salad bar, and that was a totally false statement.  The meat options were horrible!!! I was already irritated by Karen's lies and up sales, so it triggered me to keep track of the number of meat options and again ... caught them in a lie! At the most, they only had 6-7 meat options that night for dinner. We asked Karen twice and another worker once if they can bring out lamb and they kept saying it was on its way. It NEVER came out to our table and we noted that it was not ever offered to anyone else. MORE LIES AND DECIT. They were charging us dinner prices for the same lunch options. They could have simply admitted that they did not have the lamb that we requested.  STAY AWAY from this place but if you're brave enough to try it, make sure that your server is not Karen, so that you'll hopefully have a more pleasurable dining experience. Karen's level of unprofessionalism left such a poor impression.", "Date": "2016-11-16", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Sherrie", "ReviewID": "jf7fZ93XJ-VRCPaFuerkOA", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Don't do it!

They did a really great job this time! I want to note that I did not feel as though all attention was on me but rather the normal level of service was offered. The meats were very good though not nearly as wide a selection of them as in many other churrascarias I've been to. The buffet was adequate, not stellar. But then I never understood folks who went to town on buffet selections when they've dropped the bulk of their money on the giant skewers of meaty goodness.  The gauchos were professional, polite and they knew about the protein they were weilding. Drinks were solid. Servers and hostesses very nice. It was a good experience all around.   I also appreciated that toward the end of meal the manager on duty came by to see how things had gone and to hear in more detail what had gone wrong the first around. We had a good productive chat without getting anyone in trouble.

The meat was salty, and they only brought the filet around once in a while; while trying to load you up on sausages and chicken.  While both good, I wanted steak.  Of the steak pieces, the sirloin was probably the best cooked, very flavorful.  I would say the same about the filet, but I had it only once.

Waited 10 mins for our sever Stephen.  We ordered our drinks and it took 30 mins before I received my Arnold Palmer after complaining to the manager.  When Stephen finally brought it, there was no apology or explanation.  I was charged $2 for water but could never drink any since I had to get 3 different glasses before I finally got a clean on at the end of my meal.  Asked for the manager to complain about water fee but he never showed.  Paid the bill with no tip of course and left feeling annoyed and frustrated.

However, there are a lot more thumbs-down reviews of this place, and having been to many churrascarias, this is among the worst...largely due to the food, but partly due to their latest marketing strategies to pick your pocket.  The full name of this place is  Pampas Brazilian Grille  and you'll find it squirreled away in a remote corner of the  Miracle Mile  shops inside the Planet Hollywood complex adjacent to a nondescript door on Harmon Avenue.  They are prevalent with many of the online discounters, so we chose (and you should too!) to purchase a voucher on TravelZoo, dinner for FOUR ($94 - $10 code I found online) = $84.  That also includes one bottle of  house wine,  or they'll give you $32 against any other wine they carry. We passed once we looked at the overpriced wine listed.  Still sounds like a great deal though, huh?  Of course, the waiter is all about upselling you from your low-priced voucher the minute you sit down, so be sure to get your friendly-but-firm face on to defer his suggestions.  The salad bar here is very ordinary--in fact, not even as good as a decent Las Vegas hotel buffet--and certainly pales in comparison to other churrascarias in town.  Most of these places are known for the astounding arrays in their salad bars, and you literally have to be careful not to fill up on all that, so you'll have room for the more expensive main course: MEAT!  Their MEAT:  Regrettably, we were served uniformly poor cuts of almost everything they offer.  When's the last time you had  filet mignon  (if that's what it really was) that was full of gristle, hard to cut and worse to chew? So disappointing, and DISGUSTING!  The series of other beef cuts were equally awful, either due to lack of seasoning or poor cooking (either way overcooked or raw inside), with the exception of their  house special --a top sirloin cooked about right with an appealing outer seasoning.  The bacon-wrapped chicken breast was also edible, but so what--it's just chicken.  I ended up filling up mostly on salad and mashed potatoes when I sasw where this was going.  A member of our party had to ask a couple of times for lamb (I passed), but said it was definitely not worth the wait.  I had lamb once at Texas de Brasil (another terrible churrascaria restaurant in Vegas) that was so gamey/nasty, I literally ran to the bathroom to vomit. I swore to myself: never again.  Anyway, at $22 per person (before the extra charges and tip), I guess we got about what we would expect, but really didn't consider it a great value (or a very good meal), and certainly glad we didn't pay more than we did.  When the waiter brought the check, it included sales tax (about $6, not included with the voucher) and a  water conservation fee  of $1 per person (?) = $4. No explanation on that one (seems like another BS charge to me), considering that they are just serving tap water in some weird decanter.  Is this a city/county mandated fee that goes into conserving water there?  Our not-very-personable, mostly inattentive waiter then proceeds to point out that if we had paid full price, the bill would be ~$230, and the suggested tip would be 20% = ~$45!!  He wanted to stand right there in front of me while I filled out that tip amount to be included on my credit card charge.  Good luck with that strategy, my friend.  I told him to bring me the charge slip just for the tax and  water conservation  fee.  I left a $30 cash tip, concluding that was more than generous for the very minimal amount of time he and his meat-serving, deadbrained buddies spent on us (don't bother to ask those clowns for anything...they'll say no problem and that's the end of that).

It would have been nice to be given a choice. We decided to order entrees since it was late. The dinner service was poor the entire night. To begin, my family is French and have lived in the US and ordered water without ice from the server. The busser arrived with the water glasses and they were filled with ice, they asked the busser to bring water without ice and he rolled his eyes and said he would let the waiter know. He eventually returned with two glasses and we assumed he would return, with the other two, he never did. He was asked later to bring a glass with no ice. We inquired about the wines and the server could not offer any information except to try a cab.   The server suggested adding the salad bar after we ordered. It was very disappointing, two of the trays were empty and a few other trays were almost empty. I was happy I did not order the  buffet.  We were in the middle of eating our salads and the entrees arrived. It would have been nicer to have enjoyed the salad. When the food arrived the tables were so close that we had to handle our own plates as the server could not get behind our chairs to put down the plates. The filet mignons were dry and when asked for extra sauce the server returned and said it was impossible as the sauces were cooked to order with each filet. The skirt steak was flavorful and juicy. The bouillabaisse  passed the palate test.   Will I return? No. The  level of service was poor for the price that was paid. The second night when we walked by they attempted to entice us with a special, we all walked by, especially after I apologized for recommending Pampas.

I guess we should have heeded the warning signs: got stuck in traffic, couldn't locate it, was directed to a gentlemen wearing feathers and giving out discounted drink & dinner coupons, then as we were getting near the restaurant another gentlemen trying to convince us to  stop in & try us out . We should have realized then they were trying too hard to get clientele into the restaurant.   However, putting that aside we were seated shortly after arriving... and waited. Our server had a dismissive attitude and was more concerned about a dirty table needing to be cleared in his section than introducing himself and taking our order. Then after having to repeat our drink order three times he still managed to bring the wrong drink ...not once but twice. Thereafter he was pretty much absent from our table-- --however, very noticeably impatient with another couple as he kept looking at his watch as they tried to decide what they wanted. Towards the end of the meal he did inquire if there was any item we'd like more of and I mentioned the tri-tip which never again came our way.   In spite of the service I was still hoping to have an enjoyable meal. Not. The food was way over-salted and the quality of meat was very disappointing. We also had the option that included the seafood of which their  go to  flavor was obviously teriyaki - teriyaki  salmon, teriyaki mahi mahi...  and the shrimp was soft and soggy. They also brought out crab cakes... deep fried, over charred pucks of shredded mystery seafood. Needless to say I didn't even attempt to sample one. Dessert was also included- we opted for the cheesecake however, between the odd tasting crust & the neon green gel-like stuff swirled on the plate after 2 bites my husband was  done .  To say we were disappointed is an understatement--and within 5 minutes of leaving the restaurant my stomach realized it needed to purge everything I had consumed.

My girlfriend and I went because of restaurant.com, and I realize that a restaurant.com offer should be a red flag to begin with, but I work across the street from Planet Hollywood and my girlfriend is a Brazilian steakhouse aficionado. So we went.  It was a huge mistake. The service was great. Our server Marco was friendly and attentive, burdened by poor management and a sub par kitchen. But even his excellent service couldn't make up for all the problems with our meal. It started off poorly; we sat down and ordered Hendricks martinis and a bottle of Pinot - yes we are drinkers - and they were out of both. We nixed the cocktails and picked another bottle, and to Pampas' credit they adjusted the price to match the 86'ed bottle. We were optimistic, glad they went out of their way to accommodate us.  There are essentially 3 options on the menu: meat, seafood, and both. I believe the meat was 43, the seafood 48, and the combo 54. I got the seafood and my girl got the meat. Yes it's ok that sentence was funny.   I am a Brazilian steakhouse neophyte, so I was a little surprised that the first thing we do after ordering was go to a salad bar. This was disgusting. Wilted salad, stale bread, and a stab at Asian cuisine that makes PF Chiang's look like Nobu. I grabbed a little Caesar salad and cafeteria pasta salad and braced for the worst.  And worse it got. First of all, as soon as we sat down from the salad bar they immediately started piling my girlfriend's plate with food, but my seafood took 25 minutes, so that was slightly awkward. However, it did give me a chance to sample the meat.   The meat sucked. We had pork tenderloin first, which was woefully overcooked. This was followed by beef that had some kind of cheese crust that was disgusting. The procession that followed was all mediocre at best, and it was all overcooked! We went in late, like 930, so maybe that was why everything was dry and well done. But for the price I don't think it's too much to ask for properly cooked meat. The lone exception was the lamb, which was delicious.  Eventually my seafood came. It came with baked salmon, cod, shrimp, and mussels. The menu claimed bacon-wrapped scallops were included as well, but we didn't receive those until we requested them. It was essentially buffet quality seafood. The mussels were cold. Only half the shrimp were actually peeled. The fried cod was hard and hot on the outside and cold on the inside. When the scallops finally showed up, they were also cold.  We skipped dessert. The whole experience was dismal, and the modicum of savings we got from restaurant.com didn't really make up for the waste of 2 hours.

This Groupon is good for 2 people and includes 2 cocktails and a dessert to share.  We never tried a Brazilian style buffet restaurant before, so we were super excited to try it out.    The restaurant is kinda tucked away in the in-door shoppes at the Planet Hollywood casino.  We arrived around 3pm and the place was pretty busy.  The decor and atmosphere was very nice and upbeat.  All the staff appeared to be well dressed and professional.  There was a 15 minute wait to be seated and we were seated near the bar.  Our waiter was very nice and attentive.

A salad bar is available to fill you up*AHEM* I mean to offer vegetables and there is a cart that you can order a special drink that they will make in front of you by crushing... stuff(?) together.  Let me set the stage. Six of us joined together to dine out and this was chosen due to a coupon that one couple had. The coupon offered 50% off our dining experience!(Two for one to be exact so you need even numbers) So for $33 we could enjoy meat and shrimp or for $39 we could enjoy the full surf and turf experience. Now, I'm not a mathematician, but I do know a thing or two about math but 50% off of the menu price of $50 doesn't not work out to $39...? Wait? The SAME meal is $29 at lunch? But hey listen, this was our friends anniversary after all, let's stay in the mood...   Salad bar - Come on, we all know the rules. Don't fill up on the salad! I read that the salad bar is mediocre in previous posts... they were right. A salad bar with no iceberg lettuce... two choices of salad dressing - Italian and something that looked like a mix of Soy sauce and Miso soup. But no worries, I am waiting for the steaks!  BRING ON THE MEAT! The rules of the game were laid out. You get a wooden thingie with red painted on one side and green on the other. Green means  Bring on the meat!  and Red means  Bugger off, I'm full!  so you rotate it to your desired position. When we started, green definitely meant GO! We were bombarded with  carver  after  carver  with shrimp, steaks, lamb, chicken with Bacon, scallops... I had to turn my little  thingie over to red within 5 minutes. For me, the excitement kind of ended their... The meat was hard to cut with the dull knives provided. You either got rare or overcooked depending on what side of the table the carver started on and the food was ok at best. Recognizing that people like meats cooked a different way, you would think a carver would ask what the preference was... but I suppose they are just carvers, we should count on our server to help... Uhm.. Server?  When we sat down, we hadn't decided on our drinks yet so our server said he would be back.... he forgot to mention that it could be anytime that night... We were well into our food before I could finally wave him down. After ordering and waiting another 20 or so minutes I walked to the bar and grabbed the already waiting drinks and brought them to our table of cheering lighthearted friends. We didn't see our waiter again until the end of our meal... maybe he was disguised as a carver?  Good thing for the drink table travelling around! Two polite girls asked us what we wanted for a special Brazilian drink. Not knowing what they were saying I said surprise us! They took 15 minutes to make 5 drinks. It was a good drink though, and they agreed with me, tipping their tip jar towards us so we could show our satisfaction at this concoction. Wait, we didn't get a chance to try it yet... maybe come back for the tip? No? okay... here you go...   We were enjoying each others company when a host came up with a camera and mentioned how happy we looked(Maybe she was surprised?) and offered to take our picture for a  complimentary  photo. I had been in Vegas long enough to smell a rat and I wasn't shocked when our pictures came out - $30 for the group shot or $20 for the picture of us as couples. Perhaps they saw us coming a long way... they sold two pictures to our friends... My scottish roots came out as I started to clinch my wallet between one hand and my butt-cheek.   The final bill... okay, I mentioned I wasn't a mathematician right? So I had the surf and turf, My wife had the turf and we shared three drinks between us(We would have drank more had our waiter existed) The other two couples had the same, except add one dessert each. So $39 x 6 plus desert, the added 20% gratuity, drinks maybe $8ea x 9 and two deserts for oh, we'll say $9ea = $435.... wait, what!? Our friends did some math on the other side of the table and decided it best to just pay up and enjpy our night... needless to say, I won't be back.

I've been to a couple different Brazilian churrascaria's before and this was probably the worst that I've had.  I expect more from Vegas.  Perhaps it was that we were having a late lunch and were in between their lunch and dinner meats, but this assumption still doesn't make up for the poor tasting food, horrible service, and price.  Atmosphere: The restaurant itself looks great and has a nice ambiance.  The bar has several drink selections to choose from as well as you wait.  The restaurant is hidden between a couple others within the Miracle Mile shops located in Planet Hollywood, and to me can stay hidden.  Food: We had a party of 4.  3 had the meat plates and I had the mix plate of both meat and seafood.  I was in the mood for some good surf and turf!  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.  As with most typical Brazilian churascarias an all you can eat buffet style bar was available for salads, side dishes, and appetizers.  The selection was not too bad with some pasta salad, rice, beans, and even fried banana.  This banana was probably my favorite treat of the meal.  The meat I found to be very dry.  We sampled all the meats from the filet to the sausage and none of them blew my mind or were exceptionally good.  The filet mignon was the best one by far and was not a great as most steak houses.  The seafood comes all at 1 time with 3 bacon-wrapped scallops, 3 grilled shrimps, a piece of salmon, and a piece of fried fish.  You have to specifically ask for more of the seafood from your waitress, but more on that later.  The flavors were ok for the salmon, scallops, and shrimp.  Just not phenomenal.  Service: We were greeted upon entering with a smile and that's always a plus.  We were then offered a tour of the kitchen.  Sure why not...the tour is nothing to jump at as you take a few steps through a small corridor into the kitchen and see all the meats cooking above a vat of fatty grease.  This alone should of killed my appetite, but then again I'll pretty much eat anything at anytime.  I guess they wanted to show how cool the cooking process was???  Or maybe they want you to be grossed out so you don't eat as much?  Here is the biggest gripe the service from the waitress.  She took forever to just take our orders.  The food then took even longer to come out.  I thought that meat would come and go until we had to  tap out  due to over consumption.  No it came every few minutes or so as my belly filled with side dishes.  We specifically requested the filet mignon on 3 separate occasions and it seemed to come out just as the check came out...I'm on to your cost savings plan!  Price: We were given the lunch menu as we sat a little before 3PM and the plates are slightly cheaper than the dinner menu.  But of course when the bill came we were charged the dinner prices.  We quickly mentioned it to the waitress that gave us slight attitude before changing the prices back.  Lunch price is fair.

We got the Beef Special and well of course before they came around we got some of the sides that they offer and they are so delicious. Starting off  with the Cheese Bread and then moving on to there salad bar everything was divine. Just make sure you don't overfill on the side cause when the Meat comes around thats when the part starts! Trying the Meat we had 10 different kind to try from they just go around with it and give you a taste you can ask for how big of a size. I tried Lamb for the first time and that was so tender that Im a fan of lamb now. The roast beef the  bacon wraps man every thing was delicious from start to beginning.   And then came the Pineapple. Oh how can a fruit taste so good when it is cooked. I just kept waiting for them to keep coming around for more.  They also have Fried Plantains and they are so Creamy and melt in your mouth delicious.   I cant stop talking about this place. I keep Raving to my friends.

This remark actually made me giggle.  The buffet selection was decent, although I wished they had more salad greens.  The manager, was quite attentive, and he was quick to remedy the situation with the seafood by providing us with a freshly, properly cooked skewer. He even comped us dessert (this policy must be standard in the manager 101 handbook) We had the white chocolate cheesecake, which was decidedly more cheesecake than white chocolate. it was beautifully presented on the plate with a raspberry culee and mint garnish.  Overall, I would recommend this place. Just make sure that the seafood is cooked to order.  Overall our experience was reasonably pleasant. The staff was quite attentive (even when our  go meat!

Being a vegetarian there isn't anything for me at the ones back home so I've never been or been able to attend with my carnivorous sweetie.   The nice part of Pampas is they have a large buffet salad bar with tons of options that are veggie and will do a vegetarian rodizio up if requested so I figured it would be a nice place to take my carnivore while not starving myself.  Carnivore man ordered the surf and turf and I ordered up the veggie skewer.  Honestly my veggie skewer was boring and the part I enjoyed was a few dishes from the buffet which was acceptable and I didn't leave hungry to say the least.    MY fiance was in heaven at least until the seafood skewer appeared and they put shark on his plate.   He was very upset to learn they serve shark as he's morally opposed to the shark fishing industry.  For this reason I'm not sure he'd ever make a return trip to Pampas.  I wouldn't ever choose pampas on my own accord but would still attend with someone who'd get the full experience out of it.   If you can swing it,  visit at lunch because the food seems the same but it's double the price at dinner time.   Lunch is kind of expensive for a vegetarian like myself but it's reasonable for the surf and turf or just the turf in my estimation.  You'll find coupons a plenty for this place -  from 5% off and 2 for 1 dinners is what I've seen.   5% is a better deal at lunch and 2 for 1 makes it lunch priced if you go for dinner.", "Date": "2013-06-18", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Annelise", "ReviewID": "rtVwaKMy71AJDd0CHX_tig", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Amazing place for lunch or dinner.

This was my first Brazilian experience so I have no comparison to others but the meat was delicious though a bit on the salty side.

It also comes with a salad and side bar to add to your meal as you eat with a good amount of choices, but once they start coming around with the meats, you'll forget the side bar exist. My two favorite meats they serve are the sirloin and sausage. All of them were good though, ever the lamb which I don't even eat. They will make your plate full, so make sure you come with an empty stomach. The sangria is also a good choice to have as a drink.   The service was excellent.

Many restaurants put you in a shady seating area with little to no attention and can treat you differently. Pampas was totally different. We were treated like any other patrons in the restaurant. The meats were fresh and hot and came frequently. The roasted pineapples were quite refreshing as well. Cheese rolls were alright, probably better when hot. The roasted plantains were yummy as well as the roasted potatoes and sautéed shrooms. We ended the night with a white chocolate cheese cake. Yum. We would come back again with or without the groupon.

We confirmed the price with our waitress because we thought it was much too cheap for a place that charges an arm and a leg and a thigh for everything else.   In that case, get the party rollin!  It was my birthday so we easily polished off two pitchers of sangria during our meal.  The bill came and it was over $200 for two people! wth? After our meal at about 11:30pm, we spent over an hour with the manager who refused to refund us for the  $9 sangria .  The waitress even admitted her fault to the manager, but ol' cheap ass wouldn't budge.  Talk about a BUZZ KILL!   The next morning I had to call down there again and harass the guy to give us our well deserved credit.  He offered to  split  the bill with me.  HELL NO! It was their fault for misrepresenting the price, I was not about to split it. Especially on my birthday!  you cheap bastard.   After a 45 minute phone call and some choice words, he agreed to refund me the amount minus $18 (the price they claimed it was per pitcher).    The food - was a little better than average, but nothing to  wow  about.  the experience was more worth the money then the food.

We made a reservation, but at 6:00 on Saturday night we would have been ok without it; HOWEVER, when we left at 7:30, there was a lineup of 50 people waiting. Suggestion: reserve by calling, or using OpenTable app. We ordered the Rodizio dinner - endless meats (12 selections) plus endless shrimp plus salad bar. Normally $68 per person, but 2-for-1 made it $34 each. Not a bad price for really good food, and lots of it. Caveat: you also have to order a beverage (didn't see that on the coupon), so we went with the one-hour open bar for $20 (per person).  Wife hit the salad bar; I did not. Why waste tummy room on veggies and cheese. I did check it out, and it looked good; but I was there for the meats. All of them were tasty - especially the sausage and the sirloin options. Grilled shrimps came 8 at a time with a really tasty homemade teriyaki sauce, which was so good that I was putting it on everything I ate - including the grilled pineapple. Our server was Amber. She was awesome. She fully explained the coupon before we ordered (a party sat after we did but weren't aware of the wording and pricing. Amber explained it, and told them to take some time to think about it, enjoy a glass of water and she'd be back to check on them. I tried to convince them to stay and eat, but they ended up leaving). She made drink suggestions, informed us on how the evening would go, and offered to get me a special plate of well done meats. She was jovial and attentive to all her tables.

(it seemed like we were always the last table to be served so we got all the pieces towards the center). the sirloin really let me down. i wasn't lucky enough to get the 1st slice, but by the 3rd slice the meat was a little too rare to my liking. the following rounds of sirloin all came to our table well done. the bacon wrapped turkey was good, but i would have loved to have some bacon wrapped filet.  we've definitely had better, but we chose this place because we were hungry, but didn't want to go to one of the usual vegas buffets. if you choose to do the same, you can save a bunch by purchasing your meals via tix 4 tonight. they have a 50% off special for lunch at pampas.", "Date": "2010-10-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "john", "ReviewID": "D2W_tbyglN8QFxnkjL4yKw", "Overall": "1", "Content": "OWNERS: I was going to begin  Pampas Grille is a turd that even  Mythbusters  couldn't polish , or  when I die, I now believe that I will either go to Heaven or Pampas Grille , but this review will be about one server.

She poured my glass of water and the one across me, saw my Vegas4locals voucher unfolded, stopped pouring, let out a little growl, shook her hair directly over the water of my guest, and walked swiftly away. Maybe a bug flew in her ear. Maybe she had forgot something that she just remembered. Maybe she didn't like my voucher which was not free! I bid many times on 7 other auctions before I won(?). After the ladies arrived, she came back and asked what we wanted. I introduced the ladies as current A-list banquet food servers and me as a former one. A normal reaction is to celebrate, because it is virtually impossible to screw up a great tip. After ordering, she explained that we needed two plates; one for the salad, and the other for meat. She circled behind me, and then walked across in front several feet away. I confess that my next question was a rudeness test.  That was two plates, right?  She answered,  TOooo plates  as she looked down at her pad while shaking her head no, and moving two fingers back and forth while twisting her wrist both ways. Try doing all of that yourself. That two stupid word reply  TOooo plates  has kept me awake more than once, because NOBODY could be that rude in this business!! My watery drink took an hour. I heard,  Are you finished with this?  on my right; I looked to my right, then to the left. She had taken my salad plate, and within earshot I said'  nooo  to no avail. Finally, the check comes; I know that's what it was because she showed it to me from 4 feet away for a full second before closing in on the ladies. WAIT ONE F#&%ING SECOND. I understand that I'm not much to look at, and I carry a Shillelagh, but if a server wants to talk about the check, they better make sure that they are INDEED talking to the host. Besides, GODDAMMIT,  I'm A MAN, not much of one, but A MAN. ~~Daniel Tosh. While I waved for the check to come my way, she turned left and got it closer to Tomie, one of my former shop stewards, so I leaned in to see. This little POS was telling Tomie that any gratuity should be based on this number and not this one. I leaned as far as possible, and she moved the check about 1/8 of an inch, so that I still couldn't see anything. I got her attention loudly!  Why won't you look at me?   I thought that I was looking at all of you.   Well you weren't!!! At this point, I can't remember very much while being this upset, but I think that I demanded she leave. SHE WAS TAKING THE INITIATIVE OF DISCUSSING THE TIP!!!! Almost nothing gets you fired more quickly in the service industry--it is the Golden Rule. Maybe that's why I leaned so far, because her voice got soft so nobody but Tomie and Sabe would hear her. I threw two one hundred dollar bills for the $189 bill into the wallet which she picked up, began to walk away, turned around, and said kindly,  Do you want your(?)...   NOT AGAIN!!!!!! She was begging a tip for a SECOND time!!!! I EXPLODED!!!  DON'T YOU...... (as I shook and pointed a finger at her) . I calmed a little and said,  bring me my change!  That last one was an attempt to get 11 stupid dollars. I have NEVER EVEN SEEN OR HEARD any server being RUDE or BLATANTLY INITIALIZING DISCUSSION OF THE GRATUITY.

We were famished as our last meal was the evening before.  We arrived at 7:45 pm and was told our wait would be approximately 20 minutes.  An hour later, we were seated.  A wonderful gentleman (the food runner, I assume) assisted my party and I.  He was very attentive and amiable.  Unfortunately, he was the only one who was such.  This gentleman filled our glasses immediately as we sat.  And we sat, and we sat.  And we stared at our 6 glasses of water.  A server never came.  We thought we were lucky when the manager stated he would assist and tend to our table.  Then we saw him walk out with his backpack and we were again left with no server.    The entire Pampas dining experience was HORRID.  We came to celebrate the birthday of a person in my party and her happiest moment was when we left.  At 10:30 pm.  This is when the party begins...  Birthday girl doesn't feel well and returns to the room to lay down.  One member of the party has bubble gut and excuses herself.  Another member utilizes liquid courage to help with her stomach pains as I sit in the casino drinking nothing but water and a can of Sugar Free Red Bull to ease the aching.  I proceeded to throw up 3 times in the restroom of the casino, 5 times on the floor of the casino, and 3 more times at the emergency room.  Though the rest of my party was also sick, my sickness was much more magnified due to my Type 1 Diabetes and the fear of any other underlying issues.    ER Copay:  $150 Missing departure flight:  $220 Being a vegetarian at Pampas:  PRICELESS (The 2 members who did not fall ill were vegetarians)  Two nights in the hospital, I missed my return flight home, 6.5 months later and my stomach still isn't the same.  I've travelled all over the world, eaten overseas, never had ANY issues as it relates to having a sensitive tummy.  Somehow, Pampas got us -- me, especially.    This review is not only a reflection of the FOOD and the SERVICE, but also the lack of good MANAGEMENT.  The day I was released from the hospital, I called to speak with Pampas' management to inform them of my party's issue.  My name and number was given.  That was February 19th, 2016.  I called two separate times and to this day, have not heard from one member of management.    Is there a possibility I give negative stars?  Because Pampas, you owe my party and I some stars.", "Date": "2016-08-26", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Anna", "ReviewID": "cVnvx2bsmxbvWJv6GeBPmQ", "Overall": "3", "Content": "My friend was in town and we decided to have dinner on a Monday evening.  Thanks to my indecisiveness when it comes to choosing a dinner spot, I let him pick.  He suggested we check out a Brazilian steakhouse type joint he had seen earlier while walking through the Miracle Mile Shops.  Sure! So we we headed to what turned out to be Pampas Churrascaria.    We were quickly seated by the hostess and began exploring the menu.  Our server came over - his name was Juan and he was awesome :-D We ordered 2 margaritas, and then he told us of a special that he could offer us that would include all the meats as well as unlimited shrimp + the salad bar because we ordered drinks...for less than just the price of unlimited meat on its own! (can't remember the exact amount, but I believe that it was either $33 or $36 - either way, a GREAT deal!).  Obviously we took it.  My strawberry margarita was ok - it was a little sweet for my taste, but I downed it nonetheless.  Off to the salad bar we went! They had a REALLY great assortment that I thoroughly enjoyed - hearts of palm, tomatoes, various pasta salads, different types of fried peppers, cheeses, salami, mozzarella, orzo, green beans, and our favorite - some kind of fried bananas! Honestly, the salad bar was excellent! We returned to our table with our fully loaded plates.  A plate of shrimp was brought out to us with some kind of light teriyaki-like sauce - it was very good!  Then came the meats...I'm a BIG meat eater.  We were given chicken leg, chicken wrapped bacon, pork, ham, flank steak, lamb, and 2 other types of steak meat (can't remember what they were specifically).  Overall, the meat was good, but it wasn't the best I've ever had at this type of Brazilian type of restaurant.  My favorite meat was actually the chicken leg - now that was delicious!  Still, we stuffed ourselves silly! Overall, it was a good dinner and I would definitely return because of the fantastic value for your money, but it's not the most refined or flavorful meat on the planet.

It seems like everyone only goes to this place cause they have coupons, which a lot of people agreed was a false advertisement and wasn't worth it. If you dont want to read my long dragged out story about my experience at this restaurant, I'll tell it to you straight. This place is a joke. Money hungry jerks wanting to rip you off, and the food and service is terrible. Definitely not worth the money. I have lived in Las Vegas my whole life and have ate at some very prestigious and fantastic restaurants. This was definitely not one, even if it was much cheaper than it is. Point plank, AVOID AT ALL COSTS.   Ok, let my story of this miserable meal begin. I admit I have never eaten at a restaurant with this type of menu or set up. Sort of a buffet, but much more complicated. I was with my good friend, we decided to go to miracle mile to do a bit of shopping. Once we found what we wanted, we decided we wanted to eat. He had eaten at a Brazilian grill similar to this in rio, brazil. He said he liked it when he had it, and all I really wanted was a lobster tail. We went in, got a table, and our waiter came over, I think I recall his name being Eric.  He started explaining the menu to us. I didn't completely comprehend because all I really wanted was lobster with was $17 all la cart. pretty much you can get the unlimited salad bar for $25/person and add meat for an extra amount. Neither of us added the meat, so I don't know what it would have came out to. I just got the lobster, I wasn't that hungry and thought I would have been fine. My friend just did the salad bar for $25, no meat included. So no one came around to us with the skewers of food, so I can't comment on the quality of the meat. So first with the salad bar, it's about the size of kitchen island counter. Nothing really great, some lettuce, veggies, antipasti, and soup. Definitely not worth the $25.  So we ordered, and my friend got right up and went to get some food. I stayed at the table, hoping my lobster would show up soon. My friend came back with a plate full of very low quality food. Right then I remembered my medication, that I need to take with food. No big deal, I picked up my fork and grabbed two small fork fulls of Caesar salad off his plate. Right as I took the second bite, which was all I planned on taking just to get my medication in me, the waiter came over and very rudely said,  mam, you can't eat off his plate, I have to charge you the $25.  FOR TWO BITES??!! Ok, first, I am a 5' 3 , 100lbs, 21 year old woman, it wasn't like I mauled his plate, or got up and grabbed my own plate. I freaked. I understand people try to pull stuff like that all the time, but he literally watched me pick up my fork, take two bites, and put my fork back down. What he should have said was  mam, if you want food from the var, I have to charge you $25. If not you can please put your fork down.  Nope. He just said charging you $25 and walked away. I was very angry, mumbling cuss words under my breath. My friend was going to pay, and I wasn't going to allow him to pay for it when I didn't need or use the bar.  Then my lobster came, just the tail, a cup of butter, and a lemon wedge. I cut it up, and looked at my plate. I couldn't believe it, I literally took three bites and the food was gone. The taste was good, but the portion was ridiculous, especially for $17. When I was done, I was heated. My friend flagged down the waiter and asked him if he was seriously going to charge me for the two bites and why he couldnt have pretended he didnt see it. The waiter went off,  sir, this is my job. I could loose my job over that.  Blah blah blah. While I was thinking, who are you? Why the hell should I care about your job? I care about getting ripped off, not your problems. That's when we told him to bring over the manager. He said ok and went to go get him. He came back and simply said,  he took the $25 off your bill , and stormed away. Even the manger knew the whole thing was ridiculous. Needless to say Eric didn't get a tip. Moral of the story? This place is a joke. Food portion and salad bar quality is a joke. Ridiculous prices for not so great food or service. I am very angry with this resurant and I will definitely never go back, let alone acknowledge that it even exists.

The groupon was reasonably priced at $48.00. Good parts were the beverages - they were tasty - the margarita and caipirihina tasted like they came straight from baby Jesus' ball sack- very delicious.  The bad was that for a Brazilian steak house with unlimited meat the choices were about as vast as a vegan party, and the surf part was just horrible. the mussels looked like discarded tumors and the idea of peeling back my own shrimp and removing the poop line is absurd. I'm all for fresh but not when you're paying 50 sheckles. The the potatoes were instant, the tiramisu was as soggy and had as much flavor as my son's diaper.  This restaurant only gets 2 stars because of the drinks and waitress being friendly.  Meat servers were slow and looked like something out of a Frankenstein movie.  My favorite part (sarcasm) was when the meat server dropped a piece of chicken on the chair next to me and never got it. It was nice having the extra chicken guest at our table.  stay away and check out another finer Brazilian establishment.

Highlights were cheesy popovers and fried plantain.  The waitstaff were super busy and it took probably 20 minutes to get seated when they said it would be 10. However, when the waitstaff was at your table you felt their undivided attention.  There was a woman who mixed special Brazilian cocktails at the table and that was fun too!

It was my wife's 30th birthday last Saturday and a group of my family and friends came along to celebrate at what we thought was going to be a wonderful experience.... NOT!  We purchased an Amazon special for a buy 1 for the price of 2. Not anywhere on the voucher did it say, Meat not included. The buffet is only veggies and a salad bar, and that is $45 regular price. Basically, what we got was the salad bar for half off, and free alcohol (only well drinks) for the first hour, not including the tax and gratuity.  Little did we know that the meat was not included. That ended up being an extra $20 per person, plus tax and gratuity. Don't get me wrong, the meat was amazing and the service was great! The issuse we had, especially me, was when I asked for the Manager of the restaurant and the Chef came out after we receive a bill for $360!  When I was approached by the (so called manager) he walked right up to me and said,  What's the issue here ? Not as any professional would approach a table and introduce him/herself and say their name and rank, also asking us the right questions and showing customer service the way I thought it would be.  He said,  What is the issue ? As I began to tell him what the issue was and how my hole table is confussed as we had no idea and it was never indicated on the voucher, that the meat wasn't included and tax and gratuity isn't included, the hole time he had the facial expressions of, no matter what you say I will not help you, give you half off, listen to what you're saying, in fact I am going to argue with you and make this all your fault because you the customer of my restaurant that's never been here before is wrong and I am right! Let's not forget the fact that it's my wife's 30th birthday and she is pregnant, as we're having a great time and here he comes and reined the damn birthday party!  Complete douche bag, inconsiderate, false leading and no compassion or understanding of the customer or to even listen and try to work with me and understand that it's not the money, it's the fact that my friends and family didn't expect another larger bill, especially after the servers where coming around serving meat and drinks we all were tipping well over $100 plus not knowing another bill of $360 was coming.  Never!!!!! will I return to this place. I am embarrassed that I was treated with such disrespect and my wife feels bad after receiving the bill and we had to pay $40 each extra as a group per couple. I would rather have gone to Chuck e Cheese and all of us adults acted like kids again instead of being treated like a piece of trash.

Even the chicken in the tortilla soup is somehow dry! I can't concentrate on anything else.   The salad bar is pretty lacking, too. The hot choices are lukewarm in temperature and taste. The pasta of the day was penne with slices of squash, but I have no idea what the sauce was or if there was one. I do like the cheese bread, but they'd be so much better served hot instead of wasting away in a buffet tray.  Pampas does seem pretty tech-savvy, which is nice. I like how you can make reservations directly through Yelp. You can get a free dessert if you write a review with a picture, and Pokemon Go players can get a free bottle of wine if they check in through Yelp and put a lure module on the nearest Pokestop. I can't reach the Pokestop from where they seated us, though, so we had to skip that.   Also, all of the Gauchos keep reaching over the table to give each of us pieces of meat, sticking their swords and knives in our faces in the process. Your arms aren't that long, dude.

I think if I had never been to a rodizio before I'd have been somewhat impressed, as the picanha was pretty decent and the seafood that came with the surf & turf was surprisingly decent.  But, most of the meat was a bit dry, except the picanha and the bacon wrapped chicken.  The ham was VERY salty.  The sausage was actually fairly overwhelming by itself, but probably would have been fine as small slices in an italian dish.  The salad bar had a decent amount of coated salad type dishes and standards but nothing I had was really exciting.  They serve the ubiquitous rodizio cheese bread as part of the salad bar instead of fresh at your table, and fried bananas instead of cinnamon plantains are on the bar as well.    One thing I will give them top marks for is the service - our waiter was super nice and attentive, in fact there was a slight mixup (not their fault) that they handled very graciously.  I had booked my reservation for 11 but didn't realize the rodizio didn't start until 11:30.  We ordered a couple cokes and were going to wait, but my honey wanted to just leave and come back.  So when I offered to pay for the cokes and explained we'd come back later, our waiter said not to worry about it, but just come back and see him later.  So I tipped him pretty big for the cokes and then again when we came back on the full meal.  I am giving them a 3 overall, though honestly anyone who has been to Fogo or TdB is likely to grade them far more harshly in comparison.  If you get a discount to come here via Tix4Tonight or Groupon it becomes a much better value for your money, but it's still not really the best example of rodizio by a long shot.", "Date": "2012-06-29", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Todd", "ReviewID": "AdfI96gRSSz5D7ZOXF2nnQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "A very solid spot!

We had a group of 12 (understandably large but considering the setting it's not bad at all)  and they were able to squeeze us in without too much of a wait (this is the one star). However once we were in and had all ordered which plates we would want, that's when things went down hill.   Our table seemed to become invisible when it came to the meats, we had about 2 guys come and slice everyone meat and then we had nothing for a good 15 minutes. I've been to other brazillian style churrascaria's where you literally have to turn them away with all the meat they're bringing to your table. We had to inform our waitress before we got maybe 2 more guys to come by. At one point someone in our party had to call out to a guy to come by and slice meat for us and he looked pretty upset to be bothered to serve us. Our party was definitely bothered that they couldn't enjoy their meats like they hoped.   Actual quality of the meats was ok, not great. A lot of the meats that we did have served were definitely overcooked IMO (I'm more of a medium rare kind of person), but what can you do I guess.  Finally when it came time to split the bill, things went from bad to worse. I understand that splitting the bill can be tedious and time consuming, but the process of getting our bill and paying should not 30-40 minutes. Some people got their checks first, others had to wait an additional 20 minutes before theirs came out and our waitress was no where to be found. We actually asked another employee to help us track her down for the missing checks so we could finish paying and he came back saying that it takes time to split bills for such a big group (aka OUR fault)   Next time I want to have mediocre food on the strip I'll just head to McDonalds, save the money and not deal with the service here.", "Date": "2015-11-18", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jasmine", "ReviewID": "rFN_6yPqLM8875tuTdw3NA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Little on the expensive side, but I found a coupon in the I (heart) Las Vegas magazines you pick up at information counters for 5 off so it ended up being something like $33/person for dinner.

All servers were helpful and no one said,  You're not my table .   Guachos would walk by us without offering meat and when they did offer it, they sometimes didn't say what kind of meat it was or wait to be invited to plate it.

So with so many choices, we were a little disappointed in our choice on Saturday night.   This was our first experience to the Brazilian steakhouse concept (think Fogo De Chao etc).  The main entree is an endless parade of skewers to your table where the meat, seafood, chicken is taken off the large skewer for you.    At Pampas, the salad bar and sides were excellent although the area was small in size and thus crowded at times.  The salad bar is a square with no real beginning.  Thus, if it's crowded, jumping in somewhere was difficult. This was a Saturday, in Las Vegas, with a concert at the PH live venue.   As for the main entree, the steaks were tough.  Really, really tough.  Flavorful, but very hard to chew.  The lamb was good, and the chicken also good.  However folks, the price of this meal is just under $40 pp.  In all, the food quality, although plentiful, was not good enough to warrant the price.   Also, our waiter emphasized the value of getting a bottle of their house wine and we could take our unfinished portion anywhere in Vegas.  We are experienced travelers, restaurant goers etc and he caught us with our guard down.  We ordered the bottle half-way through our meal, in lieu of a second round of wine by the glass.  We do understand that a reasonably priced bottle is often a better value than wine by the glass, if the table is drinking the same (red v. white).   In this case, we made a mistake because we didn't finish the bottle as we were heading home the next evening.  We knew better but...still.  (It's like making that one extra bet at the casino where that tiny voice says no...but the larger, alcohol influenced part of the brain says go for it...and the result:  not so good!).", "Date": "2013-02-18", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Helen", "ReviewID": "FDK6ztZK3hD2kP4WKDLctQ", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Very disappointed but....

I was under the impression places like this only specialized in meat, so the seafood was a delightful surprise and a nice contrast to red, bloody and savory meat.  My favorite items on the menu: Picanha (served nearly rare), Louisiana sausage, Herb Chicken, Scallops wrapped in bacon, fried cod, and grilled pineapple.  Surprisingly, they didn't have any chicken hearts (a popular item among my friends).  Our waiter explained that it was a menu item they used to carry, but scared a lot of people so it was taken off the menu.  The salad bar options were larger than expected, they had a good variety of veggies and pastas to choose from.  I particularly liked the fried mashed potatoes and fried bread.  The sea food plate was awesome. It's delivered to the table as it's cooked, that way you don't get seafood that's been sitting under a hot lamp.  We were seated promptly from our reservation time. The place is setup nicely, with quasi private areas for large parties.  The area we sat in could easily host a party of more than 20 people.  Our waiter was very friendly and personable.  Once we were seated, a barrage of waiters came out to deliver our food, one just as quick as the other.

There was still plenty to choose from, but not as much as I expected having gone to other Brazilian BBQ's restaurants.  As far as price goes, be sure to have a wallet to match your appetite.

Normally, we go to another Brazilian steakhouse in town, but a friend encouraged us to look at Groupon and this restaurant has seafood included in their line-up of meats. My husband is a big seafood lover so we decided to try it out. We were about 20 minutes late for our reservation as we misjudged traffic on the freeway and didn't realize how much walking we'd have to do to get to the restaurant past all the shops. We were told we'd be seated in a few minutes, but it took about 35 minutes. It was busy and it looked like quite a few people were complaining about the wait. Our assumption is that even if we'd been on time for our reservation, we would not have been seated on time.   Some seating was in the front of the restaurant so those people had to maneuver through all the people standing to get to the food bar, which contains side items and salad items. Thank goodness we were not seated in the front.  Tables were mostly pushed close together so they could pack as many as they could into the restaurant.  In other words, you got an intimate look at the wait staff's rear ends about 12 inches from your plate when ever they were waiting on tables next to you.  That is a turn-off. To go back and forth to the food bar, you have to maneuver between tables, hopefully when someone isn't coming up the aisle at the same time. Once a male waiter started at the same time I was going the other direction.  Instead of being gentlemanly and letting me go first, he shoved through first.  I found that rather rude, especially since I was also a customer.  The men carrying the meat throughout the restaurant did not stop at every table. In fact, a lot of the meat we didn't even see until we were finished.  They didn't go table to table. They'd wander around and completely zip past us, without even slowing down. Therefore, I'm sure we didn't even try some of the meats. The quality of the meat was very poor. Most of the beef was extremely chewy or gristly. A lot of it, I just left on my plate as I found it inedible.  We buy all of our steaks at Costco and let's just say that the Costco steak that we prep at home is far superior to the discount gristly meat they prepared.  For the seafood, they brought a plate and refilled as necessary. The salmon was good and had some type of teriyaki sauce. There was a white fish, maybe tilapia, that was so-so.  It tasted like something I'd prep at home and I can't cook fish.  The shrimp was disappointing as that is my favorite since I am not a seafood fan. Well, it was cooked, but not peeled. It really cut down on how much we ate as it was too big of an annoyance to peel each one.  The only value of the Groupon was that it included 2 cocktails, which my husband and I don't find necessary and 1 dessert to share, which we frequently don't get anyway  The seafood was supposed to be the added value, but it wasn't anything special and I would not return based on their seafood.  The salad / food bar was tasty and I have no complaints there. Our waitress was awesome and we tipped accordingly.  We will not be returning to this restaurant as it really had a discount, low budget restaurant feel. .We were packed in like sardines and the meat quality was like something from IHOP.  This is not acceptable when you're paying about $50 per plate.  On our next date night, we will be going back to our other Brazilian steakhouse which costs the same, but they do not offer discounts.

First of all, the manager Terry (or Terri) was super nice, she even told me how groupon worked from merchants' side and let use use it a day before its  official  valid date (so keep in mind, you'll need to wait for a day after your groupon purchase to use it per rule).  Anyway, we opted for 19.99 Brazilian bbq lunch for two.  The menu said lunch had 7 meat selection, and dinner would have 10.  Let me count the 7 for you in order of our favorite from most to least: Pork loin; spicy chicken leg, non-spicy chicken leg; beef steak (way too raw); sausage; ham; turkey breast bacon roll.  We saw grilled pineapple too.    Now you can tell how limited the meat selections really are at least for lunch.  I've been to other Brazilian grilles before and always been amazed by how many different stuff we can try, but for this restaurant it's certainly not the case.  The pork loin was tender enough but lack of seasoning in my personal view, the majority of beef chunk should be rated as rare-medium rare at most, I got a bloody plate after having two slices. However you can certainly ask the food servers for more cooked region (very small region though), they are friendly too.  As for the chicken (they did count non-spicy and spicy as TWO selections of meat), well you normally can't go wrong with bbq chicken, and it's just too common/ordinary to judge.

I decided to order the chicken dinner entree. I paid $38 for this plate. It came with a LOT of chicken which was SO DRY. I couldn't eat it all.  It also came with squash and zucchini which I ate and was tasty and a side of mashed potatoes which was also fine.    My boyfriend got the Rodezzio(sp) which was all you can eat meat.  The servers came around a lot with the meats but I think it was because they were trying to get rid of it all before closing.  We also got our picture taken by a lady who snaps your photo.  You get your picture on a free post card and she also comes out with your photos in a paper frame in case you want to purchase them for $15.

We came in around 1pm, the middle of lunch service, with a Restaurant.com coupon. The hostess was pleasant and we were seated promptly and addressed by the waitress as to the salad bar and how a Brazilian steakhouse works.   The salad bar has the Brazilian essentials: traditional cheese bread, soggy from the steamer, a rotating pasta surprise that tastes from a can or bottle, cheap deli cold cuts in place of the Brazilian meats and your standard salad fixings and dressings.  If you were expecting to enjoy meat at this steakhouse, prepare to be severely disappointed as the servers come along very infrequently. The meat itself seems to be either rare-blue or cooked to death. Their beef, both sirloin and tri tip, was both seared to a crisp on the outside and almost blue-raw inside. The chicken drumsticks are covered in leather-like skin and the  house-made pork sausage with fennel and garlic  is a gritty, dry hunk of regular American breakfast sausage that makes a McSausage look tasty.   The only saving grace about the food at Pampas is the roasted pineapple, which was delicious and sweet.  Onto the service, the waitress ignored our table for the bulk of our 2 hour meal. She ignored our requests for more napkins and water, despite us directly addressing her. All the while, she made great conversation will the table next to ours, laughing and joking more than the next three tables combined. When she did finally bring us one refill of water to the carafe, it was clearly tainted. The water was sour and smelled like gasoline. Because of our waitress' negligence, we had to ask once of the other servers for fresh water, which as expected, never came.   Finally, we weren't going to waste any more time with our waitress and were going out to pay at the hostess station when she scurried over to let us pay for our meal. No pleasantries, no apology for the tainted water, just swipe the card, throw the receipt at us and walk away. This was the worst meal and restaurant I have ever been to in Las Vegas.

At the end, the waiter brought us our check (we waited longer it felt for the check then it did for us to eat our meal) he explained with the voucher how mich our meal wouldve been and how much it was (free +  our upgrade) and how much we should tip based off howuch the check would have been. Ok great. We had our xash together as we had waited awhile to pay. Instead of letting him walk away, my boyfriend put the cash into the check thing and the waiter opened it up, counted our money and explained we did not tip enough based off his calculations. Excuse me, but we did leave a decent tip and no maybe wasnt based off a 100 check but, we didnt come there expecting to pay or tip on that. We were completely embarrassed as the waiter got loud in counting our money amd telling us it wasnt enough.. the tables next to us could hear and were staring. Forst of all, we were there for 20/30 minutes. Our waiter brought us water and we had a go with the meat one time. I didnt feel good leaving there and in all honesty if we couldve stiffed his ass, we wouldve. That is NOT how you treat a customer no matter how much their bill was. Shame on you guys! If you dont like the vouchers than i suggest you opt out of being apart of it. And his snooty ass can finally make better tips! How dare he!!!

I just wanted to eat at your restaurant, I didn't want to be sucked into a sales ploy...   Second, I ordered the salmon sandwich with ceasar salad and it was TERRIBLE. There was NO flavor, the bun was dripping with grease and the cheese was so thick I almost chocked on it. The ceasar salad did not taste like a ceasar salad at all! In fact the only thing I could taste was lettuce and the fake parmesan cheese that it was doused in. Not only that but an hour later I was feeling sick wondering if I was going to vomit or not.

Glad I didn't pay full price (30 bucks a plate) but I did pay for a food voucher with our tickets and received so so service. I felt that because we had a  voucher  that we got service like we were just getting free food. We waited to be seated for 10 mins when the restaurant was half empty, waited another 6 to 10 after being seated and then took forever to get our reciept to leave.    I would say that the food lacked flavoring, like salt. I had to add that to my steak just to get a little more taste. The  fresh  green beans were a little overcooked for my taking, but the side bar was great. They charge a 2 dollar convenience fee for water but dont tell you until your bill arrives.   The bar environment was upbeat and the restaurant side was a nice place to relax. I only saw our server once though. Kind of felt like a free for all, they give you water on the table and leave you be. After dinner our server brought over our reciept and showed us what our bill  would have been  if we paid and showed us what we could tip based off the prices we could have been paying. That was a little annoying because we did pay for the food voucher and I felt she didn't deserve a tip, because we only saw her when we were sat and when she cleared our table. Sorry, not leaving a 9 dollar tip when you didn't do anything. We are good tippers when the people treat you equal and do an amazing job.  My husband and I felt that the  voucher  food was staged already. One, the food came out in like 10 min, the steaks seemed kind of rubbery, the green beans seemed like the sat in boiling water for too long and the mashed potatoes tasted differently from the food bar was serving. Word of advice...fill up on the side bar it's the best (and most) seasoned thing of the night.

So they started serving breakfast recently, and I got a hold of a coupon for $6.50/person. It seemed like a really good deal at the time, so I talked the fam into going. Which I completely regret doing cos I don't talk the fam into doing many things, and this time that I did completely sucked, and now I feel guilty that I did. =\  For one, our waiter was whack. My mum and brother had never done rodizio before, so they weren't sure what was going on. But at least they had BF and myself to explain. Any other noobs would've been completely lost. Cos not only were we seated for a pretty long time before our waiter came, when he finally did make it around to us, he did a poor job of explaining everything. Keep in mind this is morning time, with just one other table occupied besides ours. I couldn't help but watch this guy do nonsense stuff while we were just left hanging. Time after time again. I'm a lot more keen on waiter-behavior now, after doing my own time waiting tables.  The meat servers were...okay. They were definitely nice enough. But they just didn't have skills. Remember when I talked about Texas de Brazil meat servers looking unhappy? Well happy or not, I didn't get to appreciate their skills at cutting meat until seeing Pampas guys cutting meat. Watching these guys was so, so awkward. They were going for thin slices but then were only able to cut so much at the width they were cutting... It just seemed like such a process, whereas at Texas, voila--big chunka meat. The tables are also kinda small, so the servers would kind of have to cram in at the corners, and we were asked to move things around for them a few times.... Awkward.  The food itself was blah. It reminded me of what you might find at a cheap hotel's complimentary breakfast. You can def find better breakfast food at any other breakfast buffet in town. And what's up with that top glass that goes so far out, you have to crouch, stick your head in, and reach for inner items? Awkward. The breakfast meats included picanha, or 'beef' as we were told, ham, breakfast sausage, and some other sausage, ranging from substandard to standard. The best thing was definitely the grilled pineapple. Although the first time it came around, it was just normal pineapple. But the second time it came around, it was fresh off the grill, and that was absolutely delicious. It was the one and only good part of this whole experience. Oh, wait. $3 mimosas aren't bad either.  But to top off the bad, I'm pretty sure they overcharged us. And it sucks cos my mum is one of those who just hands over her credit card without looking at the check. I wonder how we're so deep in debt.... I even got reprimanded for being so stingy/skeptical when I mentioned something about the total being more than expected. Hey, I just like to know where my money's going. So I think it might've been that they didn't have a button or whatever to calculate this coupon we had, and they ended up just charging us the full price ($12.95) for three people instead of the $6.50 for four people. That's a difference of $12.85. I blame that waiter of ours.

This was not the case. This was the first time I went to a Brazilian steakhouse and had a poor experience.  The meat: The main reason why we went here was to get our meat fix on! It was bad...i mean BAD. The quality of the meat was equivalent of the  T.G.I. Fridays of Brazilian Steakhouses . The meat quality was poor and although they offered the piccanha rare or more well done,  everything else was over cooked.  The seasoning on the meat was almost non existent. We were expecting the traditional salty goodness on the outside of the meat with the crusty outside of the meat, but it wasn't there at all. Just overcooked meat with no seasoning. To be honest, the meat even tasted old I kid you not. The brazilian sausage is something I really looked forward to (at other brazilian restaurants as well) and my fiancee and I looked at each other and both thought it was hill shire farms sausage. They say it was made in house on the menu, but seriously, they shouldve saved the time and just bought the hillshire farms sausage from the grocery store right next to where they got their salad bar items.   The salad bar: I kid you not when I say this, but I felt like I walked into a grocery store salad bar. The fried bananas shouldn't really be deep fried with breading on it, its supposed to be in a pan with I assume butter and sugar. The bananas were breaded, but not only that, they were soggy and have definitely been sitting there a LONG time.  The cheese bread are also one of the big reasons why we go there! They were stale and dried out (also have been sitting there) you would assume it would have been fresh since dinner service had just started.  The soups were a disgrace as well. Chicken noodle soup and lentil soup? Really? I don't really know about the lentil soup, but chicken noodle doesn't scream Brazilian to me. Even their competitors Texas De Brazil have lobster bisque!  They even had eggrolls at the salad bar! WTF?! If I wanted egg rolls I wold have gone to a chinese restaurant.  This was unacceptable.  The Service: We waited maybe 5 minutes to be seated, so it wasn't bad. When we did get a table (there were many other tables open) we were pretty much stuck in the corner with no server for about 15 minutes. We were literally looking around to see if they forgot about us! The manager finally realized we were looking around and desperately tried to win us over, pushing the desserts and wine when we haven't even been given any other food or water for that matter. 10 more minutes pass (now 25 minutes after being seated) and our server comes up to us and literally says  HI my name is David, I will be your server. Please let me know if you need anything and go ahead to the salad bar  and then quickly walked away to tend to another table.  I suppose I could add this to service, but there was a lady with a  drink cart  that was really pressuring us to get the Caipirinha, the Brazilian cocktail. When we said we had them before, she asked oh, you didn't like it? why not? I don't know lady! leave us alone! They really tried pushing alot of extra stuff on us, I suppose it is their job, but damn it made things awkward. The whole drink cart idea was tacky.   The only  pro  I can honestly add to this was the $10 coupon they were handing out in front of the restaurant, but even with a combined $20 dollars off  for my fiancee and i, it still wasn't worth it at all.  I would genuinely say save your time and your money and go to Texas De Brazil or Fogo De Chao because even though they are a  chain  they know what they are doing service wise, and especially the food (meat!).    I usually write about places that I love, but this restaurant really made me want to go home and warn people about the quality you will be getting.

First they have a great marketing team that is constantly advertising all around the strip to bring people in which I have a lot of respect for because it's got to be tough opening a new restaurant in Vegas (well relatively new) and I'm in marketing so I know it's tough to get your name put there and they do a great job.  Secondly and most importantly the food is so savory and delicious it practically melts in your mouth. I literally wish I had time to stay there all day and just eat meat and drink wine in true hedonistic style. Definitely try everything if you can!!  When my group went we were about 3/4 through our Meal when a nice gentlemen named Bill came over and starting chatting with us and told us a nice little anecdote about the yes lease no thank you signs on the table. He had us rolling on the floor we were laughing so hard and it turned out he was the owner and then proceeded to give us 5$ off our next bottle of wine!  All and all definitely a 5 star experience every time I've been there and I can't wait to go again next time I'm in Vegas.

The tables in the restaurant and jammed tightly in there--it looks like a busy cafeteria. Luckily we were outside, but then service lacked.

The salad bar had cold mashed potatoes and an array of bad tasting food. I've been to many Brazilian rodizios, and this was the worst. The guy next to me was given a plate of sirloin... He said I didn't order this and the waiter insisted it was his and said sternly...ITS YOURS. He said he was afraid and better take it haha. A waitress came by and asked me what the table next to me ordered because she wanted to get rid of her tray of champagne...don't they now?

We had been informed of the basics of how things worked so we were aware. When we arrived, we were informed it would be ~20 mins before we were seated. Ok, we didn't have a reservation, we're ok with that.   After ~25 mins, and listening to the hostess cue people up, I noticed we were missed.  When I asked, they did not have our name on the list AT ALL. We were then seated right away.   Once we sat down, we waited 15 minutes for our server to come introduce herself. It took another 15 minutes for our waters to get to us.   Throughout dinner, there were numerous times when we were waiting for someone/ANYONE to come by with some meat.  I double checked...we had our green signs up. We came to eat meat, not get full off the sides.  The waitress came to check on us once, saw that our waters had less than 1/4 cup left but didn't refill them until 20mins after we emptied our glasses and asked for a refill.   The meat dishes were mediocre.  It may have been our first time at a Brazilian steakhouse but definitely not our first time eating meat. Everything we sampled was dry, the beef tough.  The bacon wrapped items tasted like nothing but bacon, the chicken drum was waaaay too salty, the other meats didn't have any flavor.   For what this place charges, we expected better service.  We believe that tip is given based on the service received and not a required amount based on the total bill. So in this case, we tipped accordingly.

I'll admit, maybe my issue was expecting the food to be as good as Fogo... it wasn't. Some of the steaks were salty and it didn't seem to matter if you wanted rare or well. I honestly didn't have anything I really liked as everything they brought out was mediocre at best. Hopefully this was all due to one or two guys back there not having a good day...

Salmon was mentioned but wasn't on the plate. Grey meat, limp shelled, cold grab. Ok shrimp.   Pineapple this is what we cave for. It was not the lovely caramelized version I'm used to but charred lukewarm fruit.   Staff - served by Andreas. (sp?) and he was attentive & courteous. The guys that brought the assorted meats were all pleasant. I am writing thus review while still at Pampa. We are seated near the bar. At the bar are some off duty staff including some that did not work today. I know this because they are drunk and speaking so loudly we can hear their entire conversation....including profanity every fourth word. There is a reason that most places don't allow staff to drink on site.  Basically this place survives because people sometimes like us don't make dinner plans early enough and end up here.

I regret even looking at the groupon to go here. We literally left and went and ate somewhere else the food was so bad. We sat down and were greeted and got our drinks going and were told a plate of seafood would be out and the meat would be around and to help ourselves to sides. We thought that was okay but then we ate. The sides were about the same as a horrible buffet the only thing edible was the watermelon go figure. The seafood plate arrived with tasteless horribly overlook shrimp that was inedible and mussels that we were pretty convinced were food poisoning waiting to happen and salmon and tilapia that was so awful we spit it out. The meat carvers were often no where to be seen and would come around with the same things. The biggest gross was the bacon wrapped filet. He put it on my plate and I bit in and it was completely raw on the inside, not rare but raw and had a bad taste. My husband who normally eats anything and is not picky even said it was the worst food he'd ever had and he eats fast food.   Our groupon had dessert included and it too was awful. We ordered tiramisu as it is a favorite and it literally tasted like water I didn't even want it. Never never again will we return or recommend. Being Las Vegas there are tons of places to eat that are less expensive and have much much better food. If you like good food don't go here because you won't find it.  You may think this place is good because of the good reviews but you will be shocked. They are good reviews because they will give you a free dessert for writing a review and showing it to them at the table.
