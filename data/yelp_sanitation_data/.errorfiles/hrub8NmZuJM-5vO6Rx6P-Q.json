The waiter was exceptional, the atmosphere was comfortable and laid back, and the food was delicious.  Our options were limited by our food sensitivities to gluten and dairy, but we really enjoyed what we got. I got a salad and crab legs and my fiance got the prime rib with a baked potato and salad. My crab legs were great, and my fiance raved about the prime rib for days. We weren't initially that enthralled by the idea of a baked potato without butter or sour cream, but since most of the other sides had butter in them that was out only real choice. We were both surprised how good the plain potato was- it was moist and tasty all on it's own, without having to slather it in dairy!", "Date": "2013-01-14", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Patty", "ReviewID": "tVRRT1DqKh2wQtoznYW3NQ", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Last year I tried this place as it used to be good, had to send back my chicken Oscar that had crab shells in it and tasted bad.\   So we gave it another chance yesterday and had the steak & Lobster and it was a joke the steak I asked for med. was rare almost like it wasn't cooked.

We met a friend from Toronto who was in town for 2 weeks for bridge tournaments and gaming.  This is one of the places he hits up every time he comes to Las Vegas.  We had reservations for 5:30--not needed as it turned out--but there were more people there than I had expected.  We were quickly seated, brought menus, and our drink order was delivered.  We then ordered and the server split the order into two checks as we requested.  My wife ordered the Chicken Cortez and Jack and I each ordered prime rib.  Each dinner comes with soup or salad and choice of starch.  I got potato leek and a baked potato.  I asked for my prime rib to be blue and the server said very rare to which I nodded.  We also ordered a side of scalloped corn with prosciutto to share.  Bread was brought to the table along with two plates of pastry piped butter.  There didn't appear to be any difference in taste among the three.  The lavash was not as flavorful as some I've had and the pretzel roll was somewhat dry.  It seemed like the bread was a little on the old side.  The soup was good.  One of the bus people came to grind fresh pepper which was a bonus.  There was a good separation between courses so we could chat and catch up with what our friend had been up to since we saw him a few months before.  Our mains arrived.  The prime rib was red as I wanted and Jack's was a medium rare which was what he ordered.  Andrea's chicken was, well chicken with cheese melted on top and some avocado.  My baked potato was large but needed a bit more baking time.  I got the normal accoutrements--butter and sour cream and the waiter left extra horseradish if we wanted to charge up the creamy horseradish served with the prime rib.  All three of us liked our meals.  The scalloped corn was very good.  Creamed corn with lots of cheese baked until the light bread crumb top was browned.  For dessert, I got carrot cake which was quite good.  The Cortez Room is OK.   Service was OK if not a bit nonchalant.  The price was good because the casino had mailed a BOGO to my wife and we used points to pay the balance.  For the price of gratuity, we had dinner for two.  The A-OK rating is apropos  because while nothing stands out about the whole evening, the food was OK and done the way we wanted.", "Date": "2014-07-30", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Josephine", "ReviewID": "JnZ6SbcIZNT717EnE_662Q", "Overall": "4", "Content": "This place is definitely underrated. Quick and friendly service with great tasting food! I was coming here thinking it'd be another Ellist Island, but I was so pleased with it all!  Located inside the Gold Coast, you'll have to walk through all the smoke, all the slots, and people just drowning in their gambling debts. This place is old school gambling compared to the newer places built on the strip. But, the food at the Cortez Room has been one of the better places I've eaten in Vegas!  I've tried food from the most expensive restaurants and buffets to the cheapest and lousiest dining places in Vegas. I can tell you, steak here is not as good as I've had at N9NE or at any place that marks their meat from $30-60, but it blows Ellis Island out of the water (Ellis Island being the worst place to eat in Vegas).   A 10oz prime rib dinner, with salad, and a side of potatoes will cost you $15. The meat was juicy, tender, and cooked exactly the way I expected it to be: medium rare. My only complaint goes to the salad. I ordered my salad with the house dressing and my salad was swimming in a pool of dressing. It was so sour, I couldn't finish it. But the complimentary bread is great especially with the dips they give you.  As for the service? They were sweet and attentive but that might be because they knew people we were dining with.

I've visited the newly located and remodeled Cortez room twice now and both times the service was not terrible, the people were very friendly, but it was VERY VERY SLOW. Expect to be waiting, and waiting.  Something i don't like about this place is if you're using a credit card, they make you fill out the receipt first.. tip and all and sign it before they swipe your card. I don't like that at all.

When they roll the salad out I realize its a little weird how they have the salad on the top shelf of the plastic cart, forks in the middle, and dressing on the bottom.  The dressing is served to share with whomever ordered the same one as you.  The server ended up pouring some dressing on a jacket at our table.  He didn't really jump to apologize or help but offered to get the manager or something.  The lady went to wash out the jacket and the manager came by.  He asked while the server wasnt there if we would like security to come to file a report. WTF?? for spilled dressing??? just apologize weirdo.

Where to start..where to start..?  Okay well let's make this easy and start with my favorite thing about the place, the bread. LOL it's sad how serious I am. When bringing out the water, they bring out an assortment of bread and thin crisps along with this pico de gallo sort of concoction of tomatoes, along with a side of butter. I usually hate tomatoes but that side dish was DELISH. We literally asked our server to bring more at least 4 times.   For an appetizer, we ordered crab cakes, which pretty much tasted like something you can find in the frozen food section of Costco. We also opted for the soup of the day which was an asparagus cream. Again, you could probably find it at Costco. Salads were typical, nothing to rave about, then again it was just a Caesar so there's not a lot you can mess up there.   As the main course, my parents went with the steak...very fatty but still good. I decided to be healthy and go with a fish dish. It was mediocre, that's all I could remember from it.   I say, go with the shrimp scampi, my dad has brought it home before and it was okay, very cheesy and greasy though. It's not the food that has lead me to decrease my rating, it's the service. First of all, every table is given two servers, one being the main one who takes your order and serves you courses, and the other acts as their assistant, constantly making sure your glass is full or if you need any extra items. With this type of service, you would expect it to be a high class restaurant with AMAZING service, you're given two afterall! Our main server would walk by our table yelling out the status of our food, as he walked to the back or to another table. He did it several times, after the 3rd or 4th we realized he was actually talking to us. The assistant was great, we honestly wanted to sneak him the whole tip but felt like he might get some trouble from his buddy, so we decided to be fair.

The piece of prime rib I had was possibly the worst cut of meat I've ever seen in my life. I had ordered it medium rare but needed a chainsaw to try to cut it. There was so much fat that there was barely any meat. I sent the food back because I was not happy with it. The manager did his best in order to accommodate this. The meal was taken off the bill and instead he gave us dessert. Dessert was OK, nothing to write home about.

We had not been in the  new  location across the casino so I was a little embarrassed when I asked how long ago the switch was made. 7 years! Ok, so we need to visit more often than that. In any event, it was a great experience, just like in years past. Only this time, we won't wait so long in between visits.  Steve was our waiter and he was great. His assistant  Joey  was an absolute machine. Iced Tea and water glasses were replaced if they approached being empty. The same was true for any dishes that were used; they were cleared off the table promptly. It's like Joey has ESP. This guy is awesome!!!!  As for the food, I had the Cortez Cut Prime Rib and it was cooked to perfection. Ordered Medium Rare and that's exactly how it was received. My wife chose the King Crab Legs, which is my normal  go to  dish. This plate is fabulous! Definitely enough for two hungry people.  In fact, my wife's exact comment when we left was  I feel like I'm going to pop!   Do yourself a favor and enjoy a nice dinner at the Cortez Room. You won't regret it. You can definitely find fancier places in town but you will pay dearly.  You will absolutely get your money's worth here.

I shared the Porterhouse with my wife, I think other orders were ribeye & prime rib.  The entrees come with either a salad or soup and a baked potato, sweet potato or mash.  The salad looked like something you could pour out of prepackaged salad from the grocery store. We asked for ranch on the side, but got blue cheese instead.  Our entrees seemed to take a long time to arrive (we were the second table sat in the restaurant as it opened).  The Porterhouse didn't look anything like the 22oz it was quoted as on the menu - if I had a scale with me I would have weighed it! - it was cold and most shockingly of all it had absolutely no seasoning on it, at all, nothing.  The sweet potato was cooked to almost a  mush/baby food  consistency.  We were eating with friends (who had suggested we go here) and so I didn't want to make a scene and send the food back - but if we had been there in a smaller group I would for sure have sent the food back, it really just wasn't good at all.

They asked us if we wanted them to hold up on the other nine orders until his was ready--we said no.  So he drank his wine while we ate. He said the Halibut was worth the wait.

I must say that I was doubtful as I walked through the smoke-filled casino at Gold Coast to get to the Cortez Room. In fact, I looked at my wife and said:  Are you sure?  Glad we persevered.  Setting: A bit old school, but well kept and elegant. Hostess pulled table out so that we could slide in easily (something that I only remember having done for us at Morton's). When we realized that we had been seated directly next to one of those big-mouth let everyone in the restaurant hear all of you stories type of people, we asked to be moved - and were w/o any challenges or issues to a much nice, and quieter table.  Service: Warm, friendly, and attentive - without being invasive. Our waiter and his team made sure we were happy, our water glasses never saw empty. I asked for a creamed horseradish - and they brought me a little bowl of sour cream and a second bow of straight horseradish - so that I could brew my own blend! Being that it was my wife's b-day, they brought an excellent ice cream sundae (no charge) and actually sang to her (in tune, I might add) using her NAME. Nice touch.  Food: We both had the ribeye steak ($22 w/ salad and huge baked potato). I have had better ribeyes, but not by much and certainly not at that price (think Ruth's Criss). It was cooked just right, nice sear, lots of juice and had a nice degree of tenderness. The dinner salad had lots of nice crunchy veggies in it -- and the best blue cheese dressing I've ever had. The dressing was chunky with cheese, but not TART like most - it was quite mild and had a delightful flavor. The potatoes were well cooked with a nice degree of tenderness  All in all, I'd go there again without a doubt. Our bill for the two of us, prior to tip was under $50 (didn't do any alcohol).
