They have a nice selection of cold and warm sandwiches plus some signature items.  The key to any good sandwich however is the bread and lets just say Capriotti's is no Subway....and that's a good thing.   You have a choice of small or large but to be honest I thought the small was pretty darn big, so if you order a large it better be for 2 people or because you just helped a friend move into his third floor apartment without an elevator.    The first time I went in there, I grabbed a Capicola sandwich which is always one of my favorite.  They were generous with the meat and the veggies that accompanie it were fresh.   The second time decided to throw caution into the wind and I got one of their signature sandwiches, The Capistrammi.  Talk about a heart attack in wrapping!  Thats not to say it wasn't good, because it was delicious but considering it was stacked with warm, buttery pastrami, coleslaw, mayo and russian dressing, you better not be on Cholesterol meds when you try it!  Next time I go there I want to try their other famous signature sandwich, the Bobby.  It looks like a  full thanksgiving meal in sandwich form.  I should start clearing room in my stomach now and I'll probably be ready for it sometime early next month!  Prices are a tad on the higher side, but nothing outrageous.  You're getting  a higher quality sandwich than at a lot of other joints, so its totally reasonable.  This particular location is at the Red Rock Casino but it still has the same full menu as you would find at any of their other locations.    Great spot to grab a bite before the movies right next door...unless its a movie you really want to see because you might lapse into a food coma!", "Date": "2010-02-01", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Darrell", "ReviewID": "TlOKvj6CD0PDffGVjNOESA", "Overall": "3", "Content": "So, I like eating something cheap before going to the movies.

I guess I didn't realize that, unlike all the other sub joints, Capriotti's uses REAL, FRESH turkey!!, and that helps explain why their prices are a bit higher than the competition.    The sandwich was super.  I asked for the Russian dressing on the side, and I was given a container big enough to dress my next four salads.  The turkey was moist, the provolone really good, and the cole slaw just the way I like it.  My only complaint is that their Small sandwich, at 9 , is just too big for me.

First, I made a credit card purchase and one of their employees used my card and charged $140.00. The owner called me and told me how did I know it was his store and I told him that I had not used my card before then or after then. He told me that someone could have written my number down months ago and used it the same day that I came into his store. He then told me why was I upset since I did not make the charges the bank was going to credit my money. I told him it was the principle and then he called me  sweetheart  and I told him not to call me that. Then he said what did I want him to do? I told him nothing. I wanted him to know and now that he knew and since he got nasty he could do absolutely nothing and I told him to have a nice day and I hung up.  I do not know why people think you are always out to get something. Maybe owners need to understand that if their employees take peoples credit card numbers and charge $140.00 worth of merchandise on someone else maybe they need to call you with sincerity in their voice versus attitude and disgust.

We ordered a small Bobbie and a small Capistrami, my two favorites.

Although, the prices can be a bit pricey, but most of the time it's definitely worth it.  The Bobby is absolutely amazing if you love having turkey sandwiches. Turkey, gravy, & stuffing in a delicious roll [it comes with cranberry sauce, but I'm not a big fan of any cranberry sauce on my turkey]. But while the Bobby is amazing, their Cheese steak is by far my favorite. You definitely have to get both sweet and hot peppers to make it extra delicious.  The one thing I dislike about this specific location is that they only offer two sizes, while most other Capriottis offers three different sizes. The Red Rock location, for some reason, does not offer large sandwiches.   Other than that, go and enjoy. Eat a sandwich while gambling, or even sneak it into the movie theater to enjoy during your current movie choice.", "Date": "2010-12-26", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Greg", "ReviewID": "andHQEQQxQS5h5vY_A9FvA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Hit the Red Rock food court for a late night munchie fest after the Rock N Roll wine event and had to have a philly cheese steak.

I did a doubletake at the menu on the wall, because although they had a vegetarian section, I thought it was a mistake. Looking closely I saw the  Vegetarian Meats are 100% Meatless.  Bingo!!  I initially ordered the Cheese Steak (which I was really looking forward to) - but was told that it was still frozen and not ready (I got there at 11am). So I opted for the Turkey sandwich. Mmmmmm! The mock turkey portions were generous on a sub roll, with lettuce, tomato, lettuce and italian seasonings. It reminded me of the days of growing up in New Jersey and eating hoagies from Wawa. I would give them five stars if they had vegan mayonnaise (like the excellent Wildwood Garlic Aioli).  I hope I get a chance to try their vegetarian cheese steak (btw, if you're ever in San Francisco, check out Jay's Cheesesteaks for their seitan offerings).", "Date": "2007-12-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jacob", "ReviewID": "uenHL2ECUnpZLLUmeLJK_w", "Overall": "3", "Content": "I really wanted to like this place. Saw the great reviews. I have to say though I made a mistake in ordering a cold sandwich. For some reason I thought The Bobbie would be served on a hot bread. I must've been really thinking about Earls and their holiday sandwich because that's what I thought I was getting. When the sandwich came out cold I was a bit disappointed. Again, my fault for not reading it clearly on the menu but I'm not too sure that combination (cold sandwich with stuffing and turkey) works.   Also, some of the servers didn't look too friendly. Seemed like they didn't like being there. The Yelp check-in offer for a large soda was amazing. Definitely do that if you are going in. I would say Earls wins over this.

So I'm not from Vegas but my bf currently lives there. I have a favorite sandwich shop back at home, Little Luca's in the Bay Area (pastrami with cheese on Dutch crunch roll mmmmmm), and I have to say that this place is a new favorite.   1) Food: I've only tried the Capastrami and Cheese Steak hot subs. Both sandwiches were MOIST, but not drenched with sauce. The pastrami meat was soft and not stringy like how it can be elsewhere. The cheese steak meat was also soft and gawd so yummy.  HOW DOES THE SANDWICH STAY WARM THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE TIME I AM EATING IT???  That's what I distinctly remember. The sandwich is ~$10... and like 20 inches long or something. I may be over-exaggerating that part but alls I remember is that it was a LARGE SANDWICH and I DEVOURED THAT THING, no problem.  And I'm a petite female if I may add that.  2) Dining & Take out: Plenty of tables to sit at and eat the sandwich.  No qualms about the to-go sandwich. Tasted just as warm and fresh as if I were eating it there, but then again I only had to drive a few blocks to get home.   3) Parking: Went here for lunch - no problem finding parking. More trouble finding parking at night when I ordered it to go.   Bottom line: If you're looking for a DELICIOUS, mouth-watering, WARM, MOIST sandwich, then I most-def RECOMMEND this place.

I think its the cole slaw that made this sandwich soooo good. Their bread is fresh too. I think the key to any good sandwich is the bread. I don't care how much stuff you put into a sandwich. If the bread sucks, you can best believe that the sandwich will too!  The other sandwiches that I've tried are the Cole Turkey and their Cheesteak.

We all quickly agreed on Capriotti's and off we went! My experience here tonight was truly a  mixed bag .  (+) The food was really good. I mean like really, really good. I've eaten at many Cap locations and some are much better than others. This is definitely near the top of the list. (+) Portions were surprisingly huge, which I don't quite get. It was the same price as other Cap locations that I frequent, yet our same subs here were MUCH bigger it seemed. Why is that?? lol I don't know why, but I love it! lol We actually ordered an extra sub to go after eating because we were so impressed by this!  (-) Service was painfully slow. To be fair, they were busy but everything just seemed to move at a snail's pace. (-) Employees were very nice but seemed a bit confused. One of our subs on our initial order was just plain wrong and not even close to what was ordered, but we were so hungry we just ate it anyways. It was good, don't get me wrong, just not what was ordered.  Basically, food was a 4 and service was a 3, but we will certainly be back and we were pretty much wowed by the portion size so they get the benefit of the doubt and a 4 star rating from me.  4 stars.
