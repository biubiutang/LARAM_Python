Then we order, and the waitress does not read the order back (accuracy). Then they start bringing out the rolls. The waitress sets it in front of us and walks away without an explanation of the roll or even a smile. The quality has never been so bad. DID NOT TASTE FRESH AT ALL!! We got 2 green muscles and only one had hot sauce?? Then they just didn't bring out the nigiri and two of the rolls. When asked why, we were told we still had 3 pieces of the spicy crab rolls... So we don't get the other items ordered because we are still eating another roll?!? When we request the other items we had already ordered the  owner/chef  rolls his eyes and gives the waitress a look as if to say, they're annoying... We are also paying customers.

They brought out the rainbow roll first.  It tasted great, super fresh, so I was looking forward to the rest of my rolls.  The volcano roll, on the other hand, was probably the worst version of the volcano roll I've ever had.  There were no scallops, which I'm used to having, the yum yum sauce tasted a little funny, and they unnecessarily added hot sauce.  I ended up scraping off the yum yum sauce and just having the baked salmon and the California roll.  The screaming orgasm was decent.  Again, the sauce didn't taste like what I'm used to, but it was definitely a better ending after the terrible volcano roll.  Service was okay, and the 50% off the entire menu was pretty good.  A little pricey without the 50% discount, though.    Unfortunately, I don't believe I'll ever come back to this place.

I was excited that we found this place because we'd been looking for a good sushi place. The food was actually really good but I was disappointed with the service.

One of the items I ordered was the super white tuna only to find out a few minutes later that they didn't have any. Ok, no big deal I just ordered the yellow tail nigiri instead and also an order of the sweet shrimp nigiri but we assume they forgot because those items didn't come out with our first round. We finished our first round and were ready to order seconds. It took them a while to acknowledge that we were ready to order more. Finally after maybe 5-10 minutes the waitress came and we ordered more food which consisted of 2 more rolls and some salmon nigiri. After we placed our order the yellow tail nigiri that at this point was already forgotten about was brought out. They brought the rest of the salmon nigiri and one of the rolls. After maybe five minutes waitress came back and asked how everything was, I told her that I was still missing my roll. She went back to the bar and came back and told me that it be right out because they had forgotten to make it. Before they brought it out they delivered the sweet shrimp nigiri that was ordered like 45 minutes ago in the first round. Totally disappointed because their food tasted really good. They just need to figure out a better way to keep track of their orders. I shouldn't have to wait 10 minutes to order food or to get more water specially when it's a all you an eat with a time limit.

When we arrived we were the third party inside but the only one not at the bar. The service started out fine but the hostess and the server seemed to be inexperienced and weren't really able to come back to us as much as we needed them, which isn't by itself that much of a big deal but when all the other tables are getting much more attention than us and we are waiting 10 minutes for one roll its a bit frustrating. We ordered baked green muscles as soon as we arrived and somehow they didn't come until our last rolls were arriving. When we were first seated I mentioned how I loved that Kobe has a sheet so that you always get what you ordered but was quickly disappointed when I was getting incorrect quantities of nigiri and some just never came. We really like the garlic Tuna and decided to order another and what we got was nothing like the first order and some of the other cuts of nigiri were way too thick. It seemed like there was one good sushi chef and the other one was his first day on the job. I'm never one to be extremely picky about service but having worked in the service industry and having had GOOD customer service at this location before I just had to post a review. I feel like one of the most basic things that you can do to provide good service is keeping beverages full and I was rather irritated I had to ask to have my water refilled (I had drank my girlfriends water as well)  although trivial it makes a big difference. I wish I could rate the staff individually and give the main sushi chef 5 stars everything that came from him was amazing I'd give the other guy 3 because it didn't even seem like he knew how to make nigiri but his rolls were good and I'd give the service staff 2 stars. And this was on a Tuesday at 730 with 2 tables sat when we left. Only reason I came here was because my aunt and cousin are regulars here but my cousins also expressed his frustration towards what could have been the same service staff we had. 2 stars only because of one sushi chef.  Also one dessert order per customer kind of sucks when there a lot of places that only have the same rule but also offer things like green tea creme brûlée or mousses and tempura ice cream. But only one dessert on mochi or vanilla and green tea ice cream?!

My girlfriend and I would come every single month. We love the lunch and dinner specials. I would get two I miss you rolls and a Salmon skin salad every single time, while my girlfriend would get a miso, tamago, and I miss you. The service was always good. The food was always good.   Until last night. My girlfriends family came to vacation, from Hawaii. They were in the mood for Japanese cuisine. At first, we went to Jjanga, not knowing they were closed for renovations. After seeing them closed, my girlfriend and I wanted to bring them to our favorite Japanese restaurant, Kobe. We wanted to boast to them and show them how good this place was. Unfortunately, that didn't happen last night.  We were a party of seven, including a baby. There were maybe two other parties -small parties-  in the entire restaurant, both seated in the back of the restaurant. We walked in, was greeted, and lead to a table in the front. Good sized table. It could definitely fit all of us without hesitation. As soon as we were about to sit down, one of the servers told the other server to have them sit in the back, near the other parties. Let me repeat myself, we were a party of seven. Mind you she was trying to sit us at a booth, with an extra chair at the end LOL.   Let me try to paint the picture in your head. There were seven menus laid out on the table. Three on each side and one at the end. Are you still with me? Cool. Grandma and uncle sat down on one side. Myself and my friend sat down on the other side of the table. That's all who could fit at the table. LOL. To make matters worse, when we asked to be seated elsewhere cause we OBVIOUSLY could not fit on this child sized booth, you know what she told us? Try. Try... TRY to squeeze on this table. The best part is that while she was telling us this, she was also in the process of taking a table from another party, to give to us. This party wasn't even done eating, yet she had the audacity to try to take one of their tables to give to us. What in the actual fuck? Needless to say, we walked out and went to outback steakhouse after.  Three parties in the entire restaurant, ours the biggest, and we get sat at the smallest table in there? Yeah. No. What the fuck, Kobe?   My family will not be returning here. My girlfriend and I will not be returning here. If I could give this no stars, I would.

Sushi Koma ended up being an hour wait and it was simply not worth it. Drove a few streets down and found this  hole in the wall  location, Kobe Sushi Bar. Waited literally 2 seconds to be seated, so I was a happy camper. I had a great first time experience, thanks to the chill environment, the variety of the menu and our great chef, Soto.   The menu seemed overwhelming at first, with many choices to choose from. My first roll that I always go with first, the Tiger Roll. If a Sushi place has an amazing Tiger Roll, I will always recommend that place to friends. However, this roll in particular, fell flat. They overdid it on the Spicy Tuna, it was so much I couldn't taste the Shrimp Tempura. Thankfully, everything I ordered after that was delicious and made with love. The Garlic Tuna and Salmon Nigiri was definitely fresh. The Rainbow Roll was made perfectly, and each Roll stood out the way it was supposed to.   Our chef was one the best parts of the experience. Soto made me feel super comfortable and even suggested other customers' favorites. He was enthusiastic, funny and loved that he was there.   They don't do half rolls, which is a big con to coming here for AYCE. I'm the type that wants to try everything on the menu, so I was disappointed when I found out they do not do this.

Soon after we placed our order her first roll came out. Fast service with a smile!   That service, the happy hour, and the Rock n' Roll (see below)? Best part of the evening.  All in all I believe she ordered the Michael Lui, Dynamite, Rock n' Roll (cucumber wrap, no rice), and spicy tuna.  The spicy tuna was average. Not amazing, but not bad. Even knowing that they have to make it ahead of time, my view from the bar showed a massive container of the stuff and, while it tasted OK, there's something about watching it scooped from a half-gallon size container and spread on your rice. It just isn't appetizing. The flavor *was* fine, the texture *was* fine. Overall it was just that. Fine.  The Dynamite was not dynamite. It was mushy. It didn't have enough of the sauce/topping and it had too much of the residual juices from the cooking of the onions and mushrooms. The scallops were OK-ish, if not a little overcooked. I have had much, much better at much worse places. Not at all a fan.  The miso soup was average and a little on the cool side. The cucumber salad was... well, it was OK. I prefer the cucumber to be more thinly sliced, and I had a few pieces that were not peeled enough. However, the vinegar  dressing  was good and it popped the fresh cucumber nicely.  The Michael Lui was  a really tasty combination, although there was too much of the sauce and too much of the crunch garnish. Complementary in flavor, but it made it a bit wet and mushy towards the end. I would order this again without all the extra crunch and less sauce.  I *really* enjoyed the Rock n' Roll (and, as I don't eat a lot of rice, enjoyed that there was an option without it). The cucumber was fresh and crispy, the fish was tender and flavorful, and the presentation was nice. The sauce was placed on the side; we could decide how much, if any, we wanted. I appreciated that quite a bit.  We began chatting with a young lady sitting next to us who shared with us her Spider Roll. She said she liked it but couldn't finish it. I found it very dry and had to try it with some of the sauces we had. Not enough spider, way too much roll.  Let's repeat: Happy Hour. During the 50% special, our entire bill was less than $40. This and the service *would* have earned a third star but, meh, the rest just can't stand up enough for me to put it on there.", "Date": "2011-07-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ian", "ReviewID": "Sb8edvx1Emipvnom1fS-eQ", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Been going here for a while, but now they're inconsistent with service and with food quality.

Sure they're not the only sushi bar that charges more for single serve items (after all they have to make up the difference) - but those customers that do decide to order off the single serve menu expect some sort of value for their dollar.  My fare included one roll, one pair of tuna nigiri and a seafood salad. With a glass of water my bill came to an astonishing $35 plus tax and tip. The roll was the least appetizing of all three, with an over-whelming amount of vinegar doused over the entire roll making the rice fall apart as I picked it up - plus everything tasted like vinegar and I could not taste the fish at all. The nigiri was okay, even though the portion of fish was tiny. The seafood salad was quite good, but when I inevitably compare it to similar offerings at other sushi bars around town, it seemed - well, small.  I was not very hungry, which explains the decision to go piece meal (so to speak), but after the three offerings from Kobe I was left feeling unsatisfied.

Now, don't laugh. I am certainly not a sushi afficienado by any means, but I do know what I like, and it's SPICY CRAB. Not the soft shell variety, and not even the real king crab version either. Just plain ole kani kama crab mixed with Japanese mayo & Siracha hot sauce to make the same sort of mix used in California rolls (without the Siracha, of course). The SPICY CRAB roll I seek, contains this mixture, cucumber, nori and rice. Pretty simple..... But I have found that in the majority of sushi restaurants that I have visited in my many travels, there is no such thing as this sort of spicy crab roll. On the rare occassion that I find SPICY CRAB roll on the menu, it turns out to be a california roll with a splash of Siracha (then just call it a Spicy California Roll at that point).   With that said.... I decided to try this location of Kobe, in search of the elusive SPICY CRAB roll. They had one on the menu. They were even willing to substitute 'spicy crab' for 'spicy tuna' on some select rolls I chose from their Happy Hour menu - which is 50% off the entire menu from 5pm to 1am on the weekends (we went on a Saturday evening). So I ordered with intent to share: Red Rock Roll w/ Spicy Crab not just regular crab mix Crazy Jalapenos w/ Spicy Crab not Spicy Tuna 2 Spicy Crab Rolls Edamame Miso Soup  All in all, the rolls I got were good rolls. Maybe it's something psychological that as soon as I recognize the 'line of Siracha' I seriously get bent out of shape because it seems like false advertising to me. This thought of being deceived. once again, just put a damper on wanting to order anything additional (I have a limited palate when it comes to sushi).  Overall: - Price - 5 Stars. The Happy Hour pricing of 50% off the entire menu from 5pm to 1am is a huge plus for us. We aren't huge AYCE eaters so this option made more sense for us in our dining.  - Service = 3.5 stars, they were super busy but we had to remind the server a couple of times, that others at my table were missing their orders.  - Ambiance - 3.5 stars. It's a bit of a small place but it accomodating. A little loud as there was music and 4 (i think) televisions. the televisions mostly stay turned down and tuned to different programs.  We might make it back for the happy hour on the weekend, if I can ever get over the idea that they took the lazy way out and made a spicy piece of nori and added the crab on top.", "Date": "2014-01-08", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Yutaka", "ReviewID": "alJet7e7IAR31dJrag0PdQ", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Konnichiwa, amigos!

Our first plate of nigiri tasted ok but everything after that did NOT taste fresh.. Ugh nothing worse than raw fish that tastes like raw fish LOL They put a lot of rice on the nigiri too and I noticed my rice kept falling apart which made it hard to eat.. I liked that they had soft shell crab on the menu (it's small though) and I enjoyed their sweet shrimp nigiri but the shrimp heads were under-fried..   The waitress and busser were nice but the food took FOREVER to come out ...even though we were 1 of 3 parties in the restaurant.. The sushi quality just wasn't good.

Similar with the spicy tuna and specialty salmon roll I ordered (I forgot the name of which). The Spicy Tuna roll was $3.50 and the Salmon Roll around $6.50 after the discount. Both tasted great and the texture of the salmon was most excellent. Only complaint about the sushi itself would be that they seemed to use a little bit too much rice in it.  I have a hard time giving this place higher than three stars though because other than the half-off special, there seems to me little reason to go here. But 5 stars Friday and Saturday nights!

The sushi here was mediocre. I had saba (mackerel), unagi (eel), kanpai roll and red dragon roll. The nigiri sushi was fine, but there's not much involved in putting a piece of fish on top of a lump of rice. The rolls were another story.  It seems this place is yet another  fusion  sushi joint. To me,  fusion  sushi equals cheap ingredients haphazardly thrown together, drowned in sauce and given a ridiculous name. And Kobe Sushi is no exception. I could only eat a couple of pieces of the kanpai roll. It had no flavor whatsoever, despite a generous slathering of mayo. The red dragon roll was a spicy tuna roll with tuna on top. The flavor was all spice and no tuna. I could tell the tuna had been previously frozen and had little if any flavor.  The only redeeming quality was the price.

I decided to try it again, expecting the same result. I was reminded that we can hope for the best but should always expect the worse.   My brother ordered some nigiri: salmon, uni, maguro and hamachi. He seemed satisfied with most of the bite-sized morsels of seafood with one exception, the tuna. It came to the table a bubblegum pink. Very unappetizing visually. He ate one piece of the bubblegum twins and decided that bazooka joe on a ball of rice does not equal deliciousness.  My mom ordered what she always ordered when she eats at a Japanese restaurant, Katsu udon. I peeked into her bowl and it looked like a layer of beige oatmeal with the consistency of loogies (which I guess was an egg mixture of some sort) on top of over cooked pork cutlet. She took one bite, spit it out into a napkin and said  this is the WORST Katsu udon I've ever had.  This is coming from a women who is ancient, with probably 100,000+ Katsu udon meals under her belt.  I played it safe with my order and since I wasn't very hungry, I ordered a shrimp tempura roll. One would think that it would be impossible to mess up a simple tempura roll, but Kobe sushi has a special talent when it comes to creating gross dishes. It was cold and filled up with so much imitation crab (which I call the hot dog of the sea) that I couldn't even taste a hint of shrimp. And it was gooey upon chewing with zero if the crunchiness I love about tempura rolls. I'm not sure if it was the eel sauce or if the sushi chef spit in my roll (we returned that bowl of  Katsu udon  and  probably upset the chef by now with all our complaints) but something in it was gooey. To top it all off, I spotted a long gray hair coming out of the depths of sea hotdog. Of course I had to spot it AFTER I took a bite.  I feel bad about ripping Kobe sushi so hard in this review because the waitress was pleasant and genuinely seemed embarrassed and sorry that the experience was going so bad. And she didn't charge us for the Katsu udon. But it was honestly one of the worst sushi meals I've ever had, so bad that I was compelled to write this extremely long and detailed review about it.

After being turned down by two japanese restaurants, that opened later in the afternoon, my friends and I decided to try our luck elsewhere.  We drove by a couple of strip malls, which vaguely advertised a sushi joint by displaying  sushi  on their directory, along with their requisite  massage  parlor.  So, we continued driving around for a bit until we actually saw a sushi bar that had a name.  Kobe Sushi Bar, the words displayed in a sports bar kinda font.  Alright, we'll give it a shot.  The interior looks a lot better than the store front, strip mall look.  The tables and chair are black with a modern feel.  And there is a sushi bar in the back, with a display board on the wall, listing all of Kobe's specialty rolls and prices.  Whoever, wrote the specials made the 1's look like 4's, so we thought at first, all the rolls costed about $45, instead of $15.  The menu has a lunch special, which consists of teriyaki bowls, pan fried and hot soup noodles, three combination bento boxes (chicken, beef, salmon), korean bbq ribs, and a sushi combo.  Also, there is a separate sushi list, which you can mark off, to order.  The sashimi was decent.  The saba (mackarel) was ok.  The hamachi was pretty good and the white tuna was really good.  The rolls were also pretty good.  The spicy tuna roll with more tuna on the outside had a nice spicy kick to it.  For appetizers, we got the yakitori which was ok, the tempura combo came with shrimp, calamari, and vegetables, and a soft shell crab.  **Soft Shell Crab Review** As always, I must try the soft shell crab at any new sushi joint. I give Kobe's a thumbs down.  The crab looked really dinky and battered.  No dipping sauce for the crab except for the tempura sauce we already had.  We also ordered a chicken bento box.  It came with miso soup, salad, a california roll.  The chicken looked preprocessed because the pieces looked so darned symmetrical.  All in all the meal was decent.

Appetizers seemed to be few, only desserts I saw were mochi- they did have the cappuccino flavor I really like, though.  Menu has about thirty rolls, many of which you've seen elsewhere- I was surprised to see the Grand Canyon roll available here. I was able to get a variety of fresh nigiri that the chef selected for me, but the overall fish quality seemed different- not as flavorful, light but almost on the bland side. Some pieces had an odd texture as if the wrong type of knife were used, or someone doesn't know what they're doing.

Not everything on the menu is half-off, and deciding what you want can take a while. My advice: order everything at once. They're going to bring it out to you intermittently, so you'll have time to enjoy each item. That's the way to do it anyway. The service here isn't stellar, but who cares once the J-roll comes around.   J-ROLL!!!!! It's baked, it's covered in eel sauce, and yet they still call it sushi. Thank god they do, or else I wouldn't love sushi as much as I do. Once you put a piece of J-roll in your mouth, your taste buds start to dance. I can, and have, eaten three of these in one sitting. I wasn't able to move for a while after it, but it was totally worth it.

We know a thing or two about quality sushi.   We decided to try the all you can eat.  Like most places the time limit is 1Hr.

So we were called over to hit up their happy hour on a Friday night. What? Happy hour on a Friday night? Yeah, right. And not just late-night...they do happy hour every Friday and Saturday from 5pm to close, which I think is 1am. It doesn't really make sense to me, but whatever, it's cool. Their happy hour is a pretty good deal: half-off their entire menu. That being said, I was shocked at some of their prices, and there would be absolutely no reason to go here if it weren't for happy hour.  It's not that big of a place, but it was pretty poppin' when we were there. We were a party of 5...got two orders of seaweed salad, two orders of soft-shell crab, four special rolls, a tonkatsu don, and the fried banana with ice cream. I couldn't help but laugh when I saw the size of the seaweed salads, and the soft-shell crabs were even more of a joke. These guys were tiny. Now I know the different sizes of soft-shell crabs restaurants can order, and Kobe definitely just orders the cheapest available. No meat whatsoever, just fry and sauce. The four rolls we got were fine...nothing too bad, but nothing special either. The plates were cheap plastic. They were stingy with their sauces, and the extra ponzu sauce we asked for never came. The spicy tuna was definitely a darker color and kind of nasty looking, obviously pre-made and not fresh at all. The tonkatsu don's sauce was pretty tasty, but the tonkatsu was definitely soggy...not freshly fried at all. Again, obviously pre-made, probably sitting in the fridge and popped in the microwave prior to serving. Ugg. Dessert was fine, although I swear the green tea ice cream did not taste like green tea. It didn't taste bad or anything, but I oddly kept tasting some floral notes to it. Weird.  Most of their stuff was definitely overpriced, so with the 50% discount, you're probably paying about 2/3 of what it would be elsewhere at full-price. The special rolls start at $12, with most being around $14. I was shocked to see a $22 mango/salmon roll. I also saw $20 bentos. There was $3 mochi ice cream on the menu, but the picture definitely just looks like one single mochi ball split in four pieces, whereas an order of mochi elsewhere normally comes with two balls. I was probably most shocked with their drink menu. $6/8 for small/large import beers?? That's outrageous. The average price out there is $3.50/6.50. I also saw a 300ml bottle of premium sake for $22 that usually runs for $12-14. So basically they just try to fool you with their happy hour. You might be paying less than you would full-price at other places, but definitely not by much. And definitely not at another place with a nice promotion going on.  Service was also pretty crappy.

We had to get another girl to take our dessert order and yet another girl to get our check.

It reminded me of fast food sushi.  Food was OK and service was decent.  There weren't very many customers so staff was very quick and hospitable.  We opted for a few rolls with soup and salad which was like a dinner combo.  Overall, we had an enjoyable dining experience for a quiet girl's night with dinner and conversation.   For the price it was decent, but in comparison to other sushi restaurants in town taste was just below average.  Rolls were heavily sauced and had a ton of rice, none memorable.  Sashimi salad had good flavor and pieces of fish were cut large, but it wasn't quite fresh in my opinion.  Probably wouldn't go back as there was nothing quite tasty enough to return for, but it was convenient since we were in that location and at the time it satisfied quick sushi fix at a low price.", "Date": "2016-03-02", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Janne", "ReviewID": "CEXu8IjdrQCZX3UiYTi8uw", "Overall": "1", "Content": "My daughter claims it was an off night but service was bad.

I really should know by now but yet I still give places another chance months later just to see if they've improved or anything.  I have been to this place before but it was a long time ago, so I figured I'd try it again.  As soon as I sit down, for my all you can eat sushi experience I see the paper to order from, and for those of you that have read my prior reviews I HATE ordering from the paper forms (Lahaina, Kobe Sushi and yoko hama sushi.  So let's get on with the review..  I place my first order and part of it includes 2 hand rolls. As soon as I give the sushi chef my order, the server took it off the counter to  review it  (why I don't know) and highlights my order as a hand roll.  I get part of my order and then I get a roll handed to me and it's not my 2nd hand roll that I ordered. He made it into a cut roll.  The server forgot to highlight the 2nd item to indicate that.  Lahaina grill made this mistake SEVERAL times on my order.  This mistake wouldn't have happened if I ordered directly with the sushi chef.  I really wasn't happy at all.  The quality was ok at best, food was rather slow and of course I get to the part where I like to order uni and as expected (because I just knew he was gonna tell me this) they're OUT OF UNI .  I asked about ama ebi (sweet shrimp) they're out of that too. I actually gave him a fairly dirty look at that point.  He said they get their order in on Thursday.. Hmmm well today was Sunday.  So you didn't even order enough to get you through til your next order??? Yea well I know that's not really the case. They just don't want to serve it.   This place was avg in quality, POOR in service and my record stands that any sushi bar that you have to order from on paper typically ends up with a poor experience.    I don't plan on goin back anytime soon.  There are FAR better sushi bars in vegas.

If this restaurant would like to survive then the manager will need to train their servers about proper customer service that is even if they have one. I noticed this place has fewer people coming in and I am 100% sure that has to do with their service.

We also ordered a Chicken Teriyaki Plate, Spicy Tuna Hand Roll, Saba Nigiri, Japanese Lasagna, Spicy Scallop Roll and Fried Banana dessert. $90 for 2 1/2 people (count our 3-year old as a half person since all she eats is rice and dessert) Wasn't terrible, but probably won't be coming back here again.", "Date": "2011-06-16", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
