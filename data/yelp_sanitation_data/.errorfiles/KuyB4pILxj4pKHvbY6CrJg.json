I did not read the bad reviews first, which I do quite often because it tells me more than those 4 or 5 stars and the reason why the place was rated poorly.   Anyhow, after coming home from a bad experience from this place and finally reading the bad reviews, we all had the same experience! VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE! I am big on this. I think a place deserve 4-5 stars if they have a balance of both great customer service AND food. It can't be 4 or 5 stars just based off food or just based off customer service.    1.) The Nutella Honey Toast was the special in which we ordered - delicious. 2.) Blood Orange Tea - very good and went well with what we ordered. 3.) Your food being slammed on your table - WTF! My daughter asked me why she did that; I explained to her that she may just be tired because they were busy.  I gave her the benefit of the doubt.  4.) Coming up to our table and giving us an attitude and  telling us that they made a mistake on our order because they gave us too much tea (which I was a bit confused on because I ordered 2 and they gave us two pots but I couldn't confirm it because they did not give me a receipt to reference back into), then gave us the dirtiest look ever - UNBELIEVABLE!   To the Serenade Manager and/or Owner, I have never felt so unappreciated or bad about being a customer. If you and your staff doesn't fix your attitude AND the way you treat your customer, then I wouldn't be surprise if you close your doors.  Just an FYI, your customers are the reason you are in business, and so customer service should be your utmost priority!   Social Media is a powerful tool!

I must say that this place does not live up to my expectations.   First, they are displaying coffee beans from different regions of the world. I ask the barista if I could pick the type of coffee or espresso beans and if they had any single origin beans. They basically looked at me funny and told me they only have one type. So if they only have one type, why display beans from different regions? That just doesn't make sense.   Next, they advertise that they are a coffee and dessert place. They dessert menu is super limited with only a couple different types of waffles, honey bread/toast, some kind of lemon pie, and something that looked like a strawberry short cake.   I ordered the Espresso con Panna and it was way over extracted. My friend asked if they had any sugar free drinks and they said they don't add any sugar. Not the answer she was looking for.   The only reason I give this place 3 stars is because the Cookie Monster waffle was pretty good.   Anyways, they have no business trying to portray being a high-end coffee shop charging high-end prices.", "Date": "2014-06-22", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jessica", "ReviewID": "pRPRP3AI5t7cNRaCtFTQ4w", "Overall": "4", "Content": "There are a lot of fun flavors of Honey Toast- Cookie Monster came with oreo cookies (truthfully, it looked like diabetes on a plate), a not sweet option, Plain, Maple honey toast with sliced almonds (we got this one and it was sort of like a cinnamon roll meets french toast. The texture and ratios of ingredients were on point. I highly recommend.).  A shot of espresso is $2.71. Non-coffee lattes are $4.50. So if you want a fun flavored latte, you pay way too much. We got the pistachio latte with a shot of espresso on the side so we could taste it in its original form- probably the best pistachio latte I will ever have. No latte art. No size options.   We also ordered the Green Tea Latte- still, no espresso. No latte art. No size option. I forgot to order espresso so when I went back (because lordy did I need it- obviously) and saw that it was about the price of their coffee drinks I decided to order a Raspberry Macchiato to meet my caffeine demands and further satisfy my desire to try something new. It was beautiful. The raspberry drizzle was in a chess pattern atop the foam. I wouldn't order it again because raspberry isn't my thing but I am glad I experienced it.   There are a lot of 2-top seating, a single 4-top table, and maybe 4 3-top tables outside with lightweight chairs. Not a place for a large group of ppl. We experienced both settings because it got really hot inside. I usually love a nice cozy coffee shop but this was just hot (and not decorated to be cozy- not couch or fluffy chairs). The workers looked busy so we didn't ask to change the temp but really did appreciate that they had outdoor seating all of a sudden.  The pastry display made me look away. It wasn't inviting and looked cluttered. They did have tons of macaroons and a couple other rich and/or dense desserts. No actual pastries but whatevs because: Honey Toast!  It was too hot, overpriced, offered no foam art for the price, and for a place that doesn't have a dish drop off, I had to declutter our table. The look of the place was really cute and I appreciated the style of the furniture and paintings on the windows.

Some times it's jazz which is great and versatile for a coffee joint but when they are playing k-pop or Korean hiphop, it's pretty annoying... And I don't end up staying. When I do stay I order multiple refills because they have the best coffee in Vegas! Toffee latte, chai latte, and Spanish latte are my go to choices:) and their honey toast is great just a little over priced and you'll be done with your drink by the time it comes out, it takes a while to make the toast so ask them to make your drink when it's ready.

If you come often enough, why not?  They've got desserts, tea, coffee, and stuff like that.  The place isn't exactly spacious so bring a friend or two but a group is ill-advised. Especially if you're just chilling and playing cards or something. Bring that to Fresh Cup or Icy Juicy or something.  Otherwise, it's a pretty chill place to be at with a few friends. They've also got outside seating so it'll be a bit more roomy once the weather gets warmer. The tea gets you free refills. My favorite is Fiji, hands down, and nothing else has really stood out to me.  Very Berry Waffle - I approve.

I personally love pistachio EVERYTHING and their pistachio latte just brings me to heaven! My friend had a plain espresso and it was darn strong and enough to keep anyone awake! I have yet to try their honest toast and other items on the menu.  Their service is awesome as well, there was only one worker. We sat outside but he was so sweet to bring the drinks out to us which he really didn't have to. This review is missing a star because I wish their prices were a bit lower.

Then the name  Serenade  popped up and a song was playing in my head with a chorus... So I serenade my song, my love for you and I ll give you my heart and I ll serenade for you . Yup, I was drawn here by the words.   Once inside it felt like a L.A./Orange County Asian-Style coffee shop. Modern decors, college atmosphere, but most of all the coffee menu. Yea, it felt like home here in the desert.  We always like to start with unique choices, so my wife went with their Iced Mango Macchiato. We really liked it! it had that usual espresso taste with a hint of mango flavor. It wasn't overly sweet or rich in milk, but was it balanced, refreshing and it was a better pick than my Toffee Coffee Frappuccino. Speaking of my Toffee Coffee Frap. it wasn't too bad. The overall make was better than a typical Starbucks Frap. The blend was okay  I should've asked for extra blended  for much smoother ice, but the coffee taste was light followed by the Toffee  Heath Bar  like flavor to the tip of my tongue.

As well as their quality of teas, coffees, desserts, and juices.   One new thing I did see was they have a wide selection of macarons. Which is super cool if you don't want to go too far to get your macaron fix.   Serenade is still the hot spot to study in the area and wouldn't mind you being there for 4 hours. Also, being there for a long period of time really tempts you on buying more which I think is part of the reason they don't mind you staying. I know I always buy at least one more thing if I'm there for a long time.   Also, remember to tip! I know we're all broke college students (most of us) but if you're there taking up space and you only buy one thing at least give them a tip, its just the right thing to do, especially since their customer service has never changed since day one.

It also gets 4.5 starts but since it's soo close to my house it's get rounded up to 5.  I love black coffee. I love strong, plain, black coffee. So I usually just get whatever is fresh and everything that I have tried here has been wonderful! The next time I'm there I'm going to ask for a hand pour.  My husband got to try this place on Saturday when we stopped before we headed out to Spring Mountain Park and now he is hooked. He got the famous pistachio latte iced with soymilk. I really love this drink also BUT...it's really just too sweet for me.  I like my coffee hot and black. Summertime I like my coffee iced and black.  I'm easy to please as long as it's not bitter. My fav is Sumatra.   I usually only come here morning or midmorning but I love the fact they have late night hours. I try not to drink coffee past 3pm but I love that they are there at night if I need them. Looks like a cool spot to hangout but I always get my cup in a rush and to go.

Got to try some raspberry macarons and a lemon cream cake that were well made and not overwhelmingly sweet.

Several customer, otherwise not busy or crowded. Clean, industrial warm feel.   I ordered some macarons and an iced chai tea latte to go. The chai tea was made from powder, it was pretty rich, sweet, and creamy. But it wasn't mixed too well with the ice because it didn't really have that chilled taste, just cold. The macarons were a bit on the small side. I tasted their coconut flavor. The filling had a nice coconut flavor creamy and a thick whipped consistency. The cookie itself was soft but didn't have that chewiness I expect in a macaron. So while soft, it was also a bit dry and delicate.

The large window panes have pictures that look loosely as if they were painted or something based off white line drawings. The inside is very modern, with wood paneling along the walls and floor to match with the round tables. It gives a sort of  French  vibe that matches the ambient lighting that is presented during the evening time. There is a small round platform I can assume is a stage, but does have a table on it. It has a set of studio lights displayed over.   The large bags of coffee beans with the signs sticking out are very cute, but slightly hide the table and door that is behind it. The exit leads to a patio with a couple set of  tables outdoors that match with a set inside. For nice weather and those that like to smoke, this is a nice plus.   DRINK: 4/5 I ordered a hot pot of green tea, which was served over a candle that had a heart shaped stove-like platform. The cups that were included were double layered plastic, to keep the heat, but I was not a big fan of the material they were made out of. Overall, the tea was delicious, served well, but nothing out of the ordinary.  SERVICE: 4/5 The cashier was very nice and spoke clearly while enunciating when I had questions. However, I did not appreciate that when a friend and I had stepped outside to speak, I heard some of the employees murmuring in Korean  what are they still doing here?    Serenade is open late, and we left about half an hour before the time of close so we would not burden their closing procedures or force them to stay longer than necessary. They were able to leave about ten minutes early since no one else was in the cafe, so I found their comments sort of rude.  OVERALL EXPERIENCE: 4.5/5 The music can be partially obnoxious when you are trying to study, if you are uncomfortable with noise. However, I found the environment was great to influence focus. The tea was good, again not anything above and beyond, but it was served hot and had a very good taste.

It's nice that they close so late so we were able to enjoy some late night sweets. None of us have ever been to a Korean cafe and not familiar with these types of Asian desserts. We ordered the famous honey toast, green tea shaved ice and a caramel machiatto. The desserts were $9 each which I thought was a bit steep until I saw them come out.  They were huge portions.   I've heard epic tales of the honey toast from Ichiza but this will be my first time having this dessert. It lived up to the hype-so fluffy on the inside, toasty & crispy on the outside and the honey added a wonderfully sweet and floral flavor. The toast was so large it could have used another small scoop of ice cream but other else no complaints!   The green tea shaved ice was an ordeal in itself to assemble and eat. I was wondering what was taking so long until I watched them make it with layer after layer of yummy goodness that complimented each other well. From red bean paste to corn flakes, it seemed like everything was in it and it nearly toppled over. There were 5 of us altogether that shared the desserts and we really enjoyed it. They were both light and we didn't leave with a tummy ache from overly sweetened and/or fattening desserts.

Props to Charity F. for the tip.  It really is the most delicious drink ever.  If you want your frenemies to love you then this will do it.  I've never had anything like it.  No really, I'm allergic to nuts, so I've stayed clear of any food that's associate with it.  Better safe than have any consequences.  Then came the other night my friend and i decided to meet here (closed at 2am; last call at ~1:30am) since the location was ideal between us.  Neither of us we're hungry, but just in case Serenade offer dessert bites such as Berries Waffles, Honey Toast, and other various cakes to pair with our cafe latte.  I convinced my friend to order the Hot (or cold) Pistachio Latte and also choose something for me as well since i don't really drink coffee, nor do I speak Starbucks.    We sat down at a table and our drinks arrived shortly after.  No saucer or napkins.  Just the cup.  The bare minimum.  I get up to grab some napkins only to return to my friend; elbows on the table, mug between her hands, and the biggest grin on her little face.  Super FOMO gahhh!! Now I'm really curious to see what's this is all about. So I man up, took a sip, and boy I was not expecting that. My brain could not register what was going on. Instead dropping dead on the floor, I was enchanted and lifted instead! Literally unimaginable.  The taste was not rich, bold, nor overly sweet.  It wasn't extremely hot either, yet my body felted warmth.  Another sip of the soft, creamy latte then smoothed out all my other sense.  Completely blissed out. There's nothing I would change about it.  Perfection.  This is the drink you want to share to your loved ones.  And by sharing I mean introducing because I'll be dam if some buttface want to get up on this.  Since then I came back twice within days.  Once with my sister and another with fellow Elite Yelper, Victoria Q. to partake this fine brew again.  Each one confirming that it does in fact taste like pistachio.  With no allergic reaction I still refused to try the real seed.  Don't want to push my luck because I need to live longer to spread this discovery. So for now I'll just have to take all my friends here individually to reassure me that what I'm tasting is really pistachio.

As much as I hate Starbucks, I should have just gone there. First off why in the world am I paying $8 for green tea? I could have driven over to one of the many Pho places and had green tea AND lunch for roughly the same amount. That's ridiculous, but I wanted tea and half their selections were sweetened so I settled.   The staff was kinda nice but then again there was a HUGE communication barrier which I find frustrating when all I'm asking is which teas don't have sugar. I finally get settled down and notice the music BLARING. I mean good grief, really? Are coffee shops supposed to be to relax, chat, or do work? I had to put in my headphones and turn the music up to block out that music. Kinda hard to work like this.   Now as I've sat here a LARGE group of 18 year old girls have taken up one table but no one has a drink, dessert, or anything purchased in front of them. Good thing because they are so busy screaming that I would hate to see what would happen if they had an ounce of caffeine or sugar. Seriously, I can hear them over my headphone but the staff is just standing behind the counter playing with their phones. Probably their buddies so hey, who cares of they might be annoying paying customers.   With all the selections in this town, I see no reason to come back in here again.

I had the toffee caramel drink, pretty good, but they use some type of powder like the Coffee Bean does so I guess that doesn't constitute them as using  real coffee.

Plus, they were playing indie k-pop :)   We were greeted as soon as we walked in by two very nice gentlemen and they gave us time to look at the menu. I opted for the Vanilla Chai Frappucino and pushed my friend in the direction of the Pistachio Latte (highly favorited) so that I could try hers. We sat down on the comfy chairs after we ordered and just kept looking around the place. I love everything here. I love the feel of it. I love the smell of it. I love the sound of it. I just absolutely love it! When I pulled myself out of Serenade Dream Land, I realized that one of the guys had brought our drinks over to us and asked if we needed anything. This is a sweet touch and I hope that they continue this even when they WILL get busier! Not many places that mainly serve up drinks will kindly set it up nice and pretty before delivering it over to you. You're usually a number waiting to be called.   The funny thing is, we ended up trying each other's drinks and ultimately decided to swap drinks. Mm mm Pistachio Latte. Thanks for recommending this Victoria Q.!

Reality is just not fair.   The toast was not really that special. $7.99 for a toasted block of bread, slathered with some honey, and topped with one scoop of vanilla ice cream. Oooh. But wait... for a $1.00 more... you can get a garlic version. Mind blowing. Don't get me wrong. It tasted good. I just don't think it's worth $8.00+ w/ tax. It's one uncomplicated dessert, requiring no effort at all (except for the toasting and probably the specialized blocked of bread).  I shouldn't have trusted yelp and just trusted my instinct that it's just a piece of bread, not a slice of mouth watering, explosive, tasty piece of food experience.   The drinks we ordered also tasted good. The  matcha milk tea and the pistachio drink. Their pricing were comparable to other locations offering the same selections; $4.99. However, for the same price, I can get a much larger size at a different location. It will taste the same too.   The decor was exceptional.

For people who just wants to eat, who value price more than decor, your better off finding a different location; offering the same quality and taste of food for cheaper.

We could've sat on the outside but it was waaaayyy too cold for that.    The menu is alright, there's not a ton of things to try but there is a variety. I've ordered the Belgian waffle that had berries all over it (I completely forgot what I've ordered), the green tea w/ honey (a whole pot), the starberryade, the very berry honey bread, and different flavored macarons. I've been really satisfied with all that I've ordered! I was a bit irritated with how long I had to wait for any dessert to be made. I understand that they make it fresh and all that but I had to wait 30 minutes without a quick notice that it was going to take a while.   Overall this cafe is pretty good! The food is great, the atmosphere is not too bad, and the staff are great.

It was my 1st time having it, so I can't compare. It had the right amount of sweetness.   Honey Toasts - variety of flavors. Delicious. And more than enough to share with 3 people.    The tea comes in a cute tea pot and cups. It was good enough to share between 3 people and still have some left over. We had the Fiji tea. A fruity green tea with notes of pineapple and papaya. It had the right amount of sweetness.   Service was friendly and light decor is beautiful at night.

I did order their chai latte and i really liked it, but it is not my first cup of chai so i think it's safe to say it was some kind of packaged product.   My hubby ordered the pistachio latte  which was amazing however both drinks were not as hot as we would have liked them to be.    He also ordered a $9 waffle with pecans, maple syrup and whip cream which I thought was terrible.   It was dense and like a sourdough type of recipe.  They really pride themselves in their waffles but i have to completely disagree and at $9 it was totally not what I expected and it was also quite small (thank goodness in this case) .  Most of their desserts do however start at $9 so not sure I would want to choose different and be wrong again.   I am not sure about this joint yet, as my lasting impression of this place seems to be the high pricing and awful waffle.

So lots of yelpers and their grandma have been raving about this Pistachio Latte, so I ordered that, and Wifey ordered the Chai Latte which were $4.50 each. The dessert case had cakes, cheesecakes, and macarons, but nothing that I was in the mood for, until one of the servers sells me on their Maple Story Waffle, $9..Ouch!  My Pistachio Latte was very creamy, nutty, and delicious, and although I'm not a fan of Chai, wifey's Chai Latte was pretty good. The Waffle though, was kinda disappointing. I was expecting a crisp exterior and a soft interior. It felt more like I was a farm animal chewing and chewing on some hay.

This is reminiscent of cafés I've been to in Seoul so I was pretty excited to try it. Nice modern interior. They have free wifi and multiple wall outlets for laptops and other devices.  I wanted to try their macarons but they're not available. They don't make them here and they order macarons elsewhere and would take a few days. Since I live quite far from here and don't have the patience to wait 10 days, I got honey toast and what most people have been raving about - pistachio latte. Honestly, I was not that impressed by the pistachio latte and I should have had the green tea latte instead. All Korean coffee shops I've been to have latte art but I didn't see it on mine but no biggie. I haven't heard of anyone who died due to the lack of coffee art. But I did not taste pistachio in my latte. However, I did enjoy their honey toast. The toast was nice and buttery, lightly drizzled with honey and topped with vanilla bean ice cream. Yup, better than Ichiza's version.  So the next time I'm in the area or if I get so bored and want to drive 20 miles, I'll come back here.

Drawn etching  of french style buildings on the glass and I open the door to a simple, urban/contemporary type coffee shop. It's the kind where you would imagine poetry jams or a local acoustic artist gig. (There's a lit corner that is elevated into a mini scaffold as if they might go in that direction)  Small round tables enough for 2 people to sit with maybe a dozen tables. Wooden seating with red cushion covers. A wick basket of blankets is available in the corner if you want to cozy up outside in the patio. Black and white photography framed on the walls and a chalkboard written menu.  What I tried:  The baristas are really nice and take time to do each drink. It's very relaxing actually. Music is like a mix of old style R&B and korean ballads. Pistachio latte tastes milky...really milky with a subtle pistachio taste ($4.50). Has the sweetness of Frosted cheerios. Fiji tea (~$7/pot )which is a combination of three fruit teas reminded me of clear gummy bears. It's not overwhelming but its crisp. ZZZ tea definitely had a floral/herbal taste. I think my boyfriend said its Chamomile and Jasmine for that mix.  Impression :  Goodness. Free wi-fi using business speed internet service. I must have stayed there doing my research paper from 6PM-11PM and they offered me tea refills for FREE! :] It's like a Tea Station by my house but without seating limits before they charge you or a minimum purchase limit for using payment using a card.

Perfect to be alone, perfect to be with friends, and/or perfect place for those extra special moments with your lovable puppy. Yes, I'm a bit crazy in the head xP  It's so hard to find these types of coffee shops and now we have one in Las Vegas! My goodness. The last time I was at these types of coffee shop, it was in NYC and I severely miss those times (as I always say in my reviews.) I'm just so very very very happy that there is one in the city I live in so I could run to there and have a peaceful moment.   I suppose when you look at it, it'll give you the feel of an upscale Asian coffee shop. Then when you dig a bit more, you'll realize that it's a Korean coffee shop.   Now, you may ask...What's the difference between Chinese/Viet/Korean coffee shops? Aren't they all ASIAN. Well, to be truthful, it's the ambiance and the usually, the decor. The feeling I get when I walk into Serenade is completely different than the feeling I get when walking into Tea Station. And I hope you do too ....   As people have mentioned before me, the place was clean with cute decor all around -- quite modern. They have free wi-fi and an outdoor seating area with heat lamps for those cold weathers. So two out of three times, I've gone to Serenade, ordered a drink, and just sat there studying/reading.  So far, I've tried a few things on the menu.   Fiji tea: This tea smelled fruity but does not taste the same as it smelled. I would definitely recommend it. The aroma is very good. I think out of all the teas we've tried so far, this is my favorite.  Green tea: Your usual green tea. Nothing too special about it.  ZZZ tea: This is a tea with lavender and chamomile. I've actually never had lavender and chamomile tea before so this is my first time. It smelled quite herb-y but the taste wasn't so bad. I'm not sure if it was the tea or if I was just exhausted but I could barely get out of bed the next day. My friend had the same issue. Who knows! Maybe this tea just packs a huge punch! Gotta say, I may not want it again! HAHA!  Buccaneer tea: This smells deliciously amazing. It is a chocolate with coconut tea and you definitely smell the coconut. However, when you drink it, you may be a little confused cause it tastes absolutely nothing like how it smells. It's actually decent and it has an amazing aroma/depth to it. Definitely recommend this.  Honey lemon tea: This is their winter special. I personally really like honey lemon tea because the honey in it is very good for your throat, especially on winter nights or if you're coming down with something. However, their version has a little bit (or a lot) more honey than I can bare. I thought I was going to have cavities while drinking it. I actually had to get them to put more water into it to dilute the sweetness. Yikes! Half honey is ok for me on this one!  Pistachio latte: So many people have been raving about this but ... to me, this just tastes like sweet steamed milk. I can't quite taste anything else in here. Maybe because when I tried it, I was still a bit sick from my cold so maybe my taste buds have been tampered with? But then again, my friend tried it too and we had the same consensus. It was yummy, yes, but it's nothing I'd get addicted to. I do want to try their frappaccino version though :)  Serenade green grape juice: This was yummy! They had two types of grape juices -- a red grape and green grape. I asked the barista which one was better. He said the red grape one is sweeter but the green grape is more refreshing. I'm not typically a sweets person so I chose the green grape and I loved it. On top of it, it came in a cute jar haha :) Definitely recommend.  They are still very new so I'm hoping their menu will expand to include a bigger variety of teas. Other than that, I can't wait to go back to try some of their dessert items like the patbingsu/bingsu, Belgian waffle, and honey toast :)  PLUS SIDE. They are open until 2 am!

We arrive after 8 pm and most of the tables are occupied by those enjoying hot drinks, on their laptops, or enjoying a sweet treat.  We grab the one large table by the counter and it takes awhile for us to decide.  Ultimately, we get the Honey Bread ($8.50) (aka Honey Toast) with extra honey and two drinks - the Pistachio Latte ($4.50) and the Peppermint Latte ($4.50).  The flavor is quite subtle for the Pistachio Latte and the Husband enjoyed it.  The Little Guy preferred my Peppermint Latte more though.  The honey bread is lovely as usual, but they do offer a Garlic version for 50 cents more.  Apparently it's garlic butter instead of plain butter used on it.   The menu has your standard cafe drinks, hot and cold.  Waffles, cakes, pizzas, and pastries are among the items to munch on.  They offer outside seating and blankets too!

A Yelp search steered me towards Serenade.  A little tricky to find once in the shopping center as it is tucked away in the corner (northwest).    Very nicely coordinated decor-a mixture of stone, brick, and wood paneling coupled with a unique hanging light bulb fixture which caught my eye upon entering. The scene was lively, a mix of younger and older adults. The staff at the front appeared extremely occupied with making orders.  After a few minutes  they acknowledged us and took our order of honey bread (toast) + a pistachio latte. Both orders were made at the recommendation of Yelp reviewers as I wasn't in the mood for any surprises.  I was intrigued by the concept of garlic honey bread but again, decided to not take any chances.    Our order was out within 15 minutes and before any pictures could be taken, our two forks had gone in for the killing. My boyfriend and I have difficultly rationing honey bread in equal parts as we're both hardcore fanatics of the dessert.  The outside of the honey bread was too crisp for my liking but the insides were perfectly soft and doughy.  Accompanied by vanilla bean ice cream (which they initially said they were out of but somehow delivered on) and you have the makings of one hell of a dessert. It doesn't sound like much, slabs of Texas looking toast + butter + ice cream + honey drizzled all over, but sometimes it's the simplest combinations that truly hit the spot. The pistachio latte tasted of cream and milk with a slight hint of pistachio flavoring. I would've preferred a little more sugar be added as the flavor was subdued.

I wanted some sort of sweet but the selection was sparse to honey toast, one kind of cake in the display and a few french macarons so I passed.   The place is pretty cute though and it's open late in a area where there isn't many late night spots. I'll probably try other items off the menu and re evaluate how I feel about this place.

We were initially the only customers just as they opened at 8AM ready for our unorthodox breakkie. My heart sure sank as the gentleman (later identified as an owner, Ray) profusely apologized and explained they did not even receive their bread delivery until 1PM. He offered a variety of other pastries, etc, but when he realized how far we'd come and our hearts were set on Honey Toast, he went above and beyond extraordinary customer service...  We noticed an employee leave as we sipped lattes, water and chatted. We even joked  maybe he ran out for bread.  A few more customers sidled in and Ray approached us again asking which Honey Toast we wanted? When we replied  plain and Garlic  he asked if we wanted both with vanilla bean ice cream or whipped cream. We went for the former. They HAD gone out for bread just for us!   It really is an attractive spot in the SW: nice lighting, a heated patio, exposed brick with an open airy feel. Clearly, I was already very impressed with them running out for bread, the Honey Toasts themselves were delicious, garlic is the clear winner, IMO and both trump Ichiza.   As if all of Ray's super efforts were not enough, when we asked for the check he insisted  no charge!  Even for the delightful Pistachio Latte I thoroughly enjoyed, though I'm not a coffee drinker. Many could take a page from this young business owner's customer service ethic. Though it is clear across town, I'll be back and have already suggested Serenade to others. Open until 2AM, I'm sure they will become a more popular spot with such dedication to customer satisfaction.  This visit just cost a tip - and lack of photos on my part due to wonky phone - and while a few others have questioned the prices since most items are not made in house; the service has me sold.

I took my parents immediately the next day to try their coffees. My parents in all their travelling wisdom claimed that the Cafe Latte was very reminiscent of the drinks they would order when they travelled Europe. Otherwise an excellent drink.   The only problem we had on our encounter today that i did not face yesterday was the fact that it took particularly long to get the drinks dished out. We waited almost thirty minutes for our coffees and while it was worth the wait, it should not have taken that long. One of the baristas apologized and said that this does not usually happen, so dont start thinking youre in for a bad time.

This cute little coffee shop offers up solid coffee, desserts, honey toast (which is apparently a big deal based on other reviews?) and is complete with plentiful seating and a patio. And I love a good patio.  They're popular for the pistachio latte, a subtly nutty, creamy beverage that's perfect for non-coffee drinkers. Don't mistake that as a slam-I pound a lot of coffee, but sometimes I just want something that doesn't wind me up and the pistachio latte is perfect for that. They also offer a variety of teas (you get an entire pot for about $6-comes with one of those candle warmer things), bagels, desserts, iced beverages and more.  The service is super friendly and attentive! Once you place your order, they'll bring your beverage/food out to you and there's no confusion about that process like there is at say, another coffee shop in Boca Park that still can't seem to clarify whether or not you wait at the counter. I guess my only ding on this place was that the music was kind of loud, but a lot of people were in there studying and had headphones in so I guess it really didn't matter. It's probably quieter on their fantastic patio which I'll definitely enjoy if I'm back here in the warmer spring months.  It is pricier than your average Starbucks, but most small businesses are.

It's exactly the fact that Vegas is lacking in this kind of establishment that makes me not want to go to Serenade. It's hyped up (because like me, many young adults or students were excited to see such a place open up) and therefore way too crowded. I can almost never find seating, even going alone. A lot of the patrons give off unfriendly vibes as if they're better than me. It's just not very welcoming.  The employees are indeed well-dressed and look polished but they too don't seem very welcoming. The customer service is just alright but nothing that made me go,  oh I am so adding to the tip jar!  The coffee drinks are alright, albeit burnt at times and the tea is on the weak and lame side. The desserts are wayyyyy to overpriced. The waffles had a gummy texture rather than a more appetizing crispy or fluffy texture. It's just pretty.  Everything about this place is just eyecandy. It's nice to go in to check it out and look at everything but the actual service, drinks, and desserts fall short. It's also difficult to enjoy the place if you can't even sit down as well.

My cousin told me about Serenade a while back and ever since then, I fell in love with this place.  Usually, I use Serenade as a place to study and relax with a hot pot of tea. I feel like this place gets crowded during exam weeks because a lot of people come here and use it as their own little study area as well (I mean, who wouldn't?).  My past few visits to Serenade have been enjoyable, except for one night when the music was practically blaring. I'll just consider that night where the music was too loud an outlier because it's usually calm in there... Anyway, the place can get crowded quick (even with their additional outdoor seating) so if you plan on studying, I suggest claiming a table before placing your order.  The staff is friendly, and they answered any questions I had about their coffee/tea. What I like about this place is that they actually deliver whatever you order to wherever you are instead of walking up to the counter to retrieve it yourself. I think this place has customer service invested in their workers.  As for their drinks, I usually just order a pot of tea because I'm there for a while studying. The good thing about the pots is that they are bottomless. That's right - FREE refills! My favorite ones are: ZZZ, Fiji, and Buccaneer.  The ZZZ tea reminds me of the Sleepytime teas. It tastes like lavender or chamomile. I don't know what it is exactly, but it should help you relax after a few sips. The Fiji tea has a pineapple flavor. I really liked this tea, but after a while it gave me a sour aftertaste. The Buccaneer tea is probably my absolute favorite out of the three listed. The flavor to this tea is a coconut/chocolate fusion, which pairs well with their macarons (especially their blackberry or chocolate ones)!  They also have lemonades there. On a different occasion, I went with the serenade drink (just because it's the name of the shop). I didn't quite hear what the barista said about this lemonade, but it tasted like a mixture of kiwi, grape, and/or blueberry.

It wasn't until when, in my 20's, I went back as an adult to further my studies that I REALLY fell in love with coffee. My favorite came from this little bar in Busseto, the town Giuseppe Verdi, my favorite opera composer, was born.  OK, I'm telling you all this so you understand where I am coming from when I boldly proclaim: The barrista at Serenade made me one of the TOP TWO espressi of my life!  I cannot put one ahead of the other, because, as my father once taught me in my inquiry of who was a better tenor, Pavarotti or Domingo:  it's unfair to compare greatness to one another .  The espresso had great viscosity, creamy on the palate, AWESOME walnut shell color foam, beautifully portioned (about .75 oz), and a flavor that took me back to the land of my ancestry.

Small and stylish with free Wi-Fi and comfortable seating plus a soundtrack that is present but not invasive it was with some irritation that, true to rumor, our arrival was originally met with the restaurant claiming to be unable to make honey toast because they were 'out of bread' while also confirming that none of the pastries were made in-house but in true service recovery mode it was then with some surprise that upon hearing about our reasons for visiting a clerk was dispatched not only to retrieve bread but also to prepare two orders of the item for free - one traditional, one with garlic, and both topped with ice cream plus honey.  Admittedly impressed by such a showing of service though still a bit mystified as to how/why they would allow this issue to be recurrent I must say that overall the latte was serviceable albeit a bit cooler than I'd prefer while both of the honey toasts were quite good, the texture every bit on par with Ichiza and better than Spot while the quality of the bread and ice cream outstripped both.  Perhaps a bit too new to judge I cannot say yet that I'd rush back to Serenade given the distance from my home but at the same time I'd also not hesitate to recommend a visit provided Ray and team straighten out the bread situation as the garlic honey toast is definitely something that needs to be experienced to be appreciated.", "Date": "2013-12-02", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Sue", "ReviewID": "S-IM8XV-FE9oBUlsn5gVbA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I must say the customer service this time was much better, completely different staff and a whole lot friendlier.

I saw a a few people studying and others eating honey toast.   Simple menu with coffee, non coffee and frappe choices. Macarons buy 5 get 1 free. I was excited because I saw shaved ice, but we already got gelato at gelatology.  When we walked in there was a girl at the counter but she didn't say anything to us and just awkwardly stared at us as we looked at the menu. Eventually another girl came and she was nice. She recommended the Spanish latte saying that it's made with condensed milk and also a pistachio latte with a shot of espresso. We ended up getting those two drinks and a green tea latte.  The Spanish latte and green tea latte were warm...  There was actually no point in putting a sleeve over it since the cup wasn't hot. My friend said she couldn't taste the condensed milk in her Spanish latte. The green tea latte is powder based and that's exactly what it tasted like... Powder and milk. I went back and asked them to add in a shot of espresso ($1.08 extra). I was surprised it cost that much for an additional shot, other coffee places I've been to usually don't charge more than $0.50-$0.75. After that the green tea latte was MUCH better. The pistachio latte with a shot of espresso was the best thing out of the drinks we ordered because it was actually hot!   I won't be back for their drinks... I'll stick to samba latte instead, but I might want to try their honey toast.", "Date": "2016-03-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Meghan", "ReviewID": "9BESEDYzpjfIpJe7qRnK1Q", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I went there to study.

Their menu has the typical spread of cafe beverages, from coffee to lattes to frappuccinos.  They also serve food, but it consists of dessert type foods: honey toast, waffles, pastries, cakes, etc.  Not exactly the kind of cafe you would start your day at by getting coffee and breakfast (unless you enjoy sugary breakfasts).

You get 1 free after 9. My daughter ordered a pot of hot Fiji tea. It is brought out to our table in a pretty glass pot with a tea light holder. Fragrant green tea with delicate notes of papaya and pineapple. Soothing warm comfort, but a bit extravagant at $7. I wanted something cold so I got the green SerenADE. It comes in a cute bottle with a cork cap and the most refreshing drink of green grapes. Why is this drink not on more menus?? It is like drinking summer in...so light and an  ahhh  in every sip! I would definitely get this over and over again. I can't wait to try the red SerenADE made with red grapes.

Fluffy bread, vanilla ice cream, honey, butter...these are 4 of my favorite things. It was good...really good. Toasted cube of bread with a buttery soft center and a big scoop of vanilla ice cream with the added gooey goodness of honey drizzled all over. Yes, this was a sugar overload but my sweet tooth took over and then all that was left was a small puddle of vanilla ice cream among scraps of bread. I think my daughter managed to get some lol.
