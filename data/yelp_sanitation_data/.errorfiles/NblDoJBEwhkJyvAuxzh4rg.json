Really cool!...Our food server Yoshi was awesome giving us the detail on how long to cook the meats. High quality meats! We tried the different meats, broccoli and mushroom. To end the our experience was the Sake Bomb! I think everybody should try it for fun. What I noticed too is that you have less of that barbeque smell when you get back to the car. I recommend this to anyone looking for quality food that's reasonably priced with the perfect ambiance.

Once seated at our booth, taitress said it was her second day on the job and she was terrible.  I wasn't able to use my LivingSocial (all I had to do was order 2 more items to reach the $30 spending requirement) voucher but she kept ignoring our table (she would speed past us on her way to/from the kitchen).  I had to flag another waiter to get our water glasses refilled. - Monday: Andrew was a great waiter.  Finally able to use the LivingSocial voucher and it was happy hour. - I would only come back if: 1) it was happy hour and 2) I don't have that same first waitress.   - For now the place gets 1-star as it is pricey bbq (even during happy hour) but will adjust my rating up if future visit(s) are on par with waiter Andrew's service. - Tip to Management: If your voucher  excludes Lunch Set Menus  then Dinner Set Menus are fair game.  If you want to exclude that to, then add  excludes Dinner Set Menus.

First time on my birthday 11/19: got the premium HH $55 Special which came with harami skirt, filet mignon, shrimp, pork belly, short rib and chicken. Of course it came with the app of soup, salad, edamame, and a few others as well like tofu nugget, gyoza, and an unknown lol. Top favorite were the skirt, filet and chicken. Service was good, the server at the time was starting his first day but did very well.   Second time was Friday night 1/22: came in with mom, this time got the same special, adding in beef tacos, cheese wonton, sweet potato fries. Before we could taste any of it my mom felt ill and wanted to go home, so I asked for my check and paid the bill and unfortunately had to cancel the meal. Tim the manager immediately responded with helping me out the next time we come in which lead to tonight.   Monday 1/25: Pretty busy for a Monday night, had to get a reservation first, spoke to Tim the manager and immediately helped us right away and got to continue with our last server, which was Steven, super cool dude! We ordered everything from last time that we didn't get to enjoy and got to taste everything and it was great! Service was excellent and frequent, food was cooked to right temperatures (appetizers). Total check was $88.00 with the extra filet mignon I ordered with drinks and tipped $25.00.

Our server was Bank and he was on point with every thing. The food did take a little long to come out and we did have to remind our server. We ordered off the happy hour menu and we had ordered the shio ramen as well.  The shio ramen was incredibly bland; I used to work in a ramen restaurant for two years and I have been to countless other restaurants that serve ramen but this ramen was by far the worse ramen I've ever had. Save your 7 dollars or so and get some more BBQ that's for sure...  The meat itself for the BBQ was quite delicious. Some pieces of the toro beef were incredibly dry and hard to chew. I'd say try the other meats they offer instead (I can't remember their names right now).  My friend and I had the s'mores for dessert and it was delicious and a great experience.  Our total bill came out to be around 70 dollars for dinner for two hungry girls. Neither one of us had drinks, but we did get ramen along with the BBQ.

It also was very easy to schedule a reservation even for 6 of us.   The only reason I didn't give this place a 5 star would be the slow service.

However, our server Steven was incredible and made the review completely worthy of a 5.  Came here with my parents to enjoy a Christmas Eve dinner. Upon walking in, I first took note of the beautiful exterior. Walking in, the same enjoyable look followed inside. There were partitions between areas of the room and tables, making each party's experience more private.  Between us three, we picked the Meat Lover's combo that is meant for two people and a few side dishes of vegetables. It was totally enough for all of us, so I'd suggest doing something like this unless you're super hungry. It comes with miso soup, salad, an fried bread/cheese appetizer, fried chicken, and a handful of meats to cook on the grill. I didn't really care for the fried chicken or fried bread, but otherwise the grilled meats were all solid. My parents also both got beers because there was a deal where each beer (Sapporo) was $1.50. We were stunned!! Such a great price.  Service was just wonderful. Steven was an awesome server and exactly how I wish all my servers would be like. He was friendly and approachable, without ever seeming fake. He was always attentive, but didn't ever checking in too often which can also be annoying. Refilled our drinks without us ever having to ask. I've been a server in the past, so I guess I expect a lot, but Steven was just a natural. Seriously made our experience all the better. If you read this, thanks Steven!!! We're definitely going to ask for you next time we come.  All in all, Gyu-Kaku was rad. I think the pre-decided combinations are the most worth it, but a la carte is just as good too if you're picky and know exactly what you want. Definitely make a reservation as this place can get busy.

Happy hour meats are $3.99 if you only get the cheaper priced meats. They are better quality than AYCE Kbbq meats in Vegas. If you are looking for quantity, then this isn't the place for you.

It's not all you can eat and you cook your own food.  I don't mind because I think that I'm the best cook ever. Everything cooks in about 1.5 minutes per side.  I've tried all the red meats, the shrimp, the salmon, and even the chicken.  Take my advice and skip the chicken.  The rest is pretty good and my favorite is their hanger steak.  Each serving of their hanger steak is about 3 oz., it's a little thin, but marinated just right for my taste.  Price for dinner is comparable to the rest of the Asian BBQ places out here.  Happy Hour is a couple bucks off their dinner prices.  In my opinion, you get the most out of your money during lunch when the prices are almost half off.  9 oz. of meat for around $10??

I was so excited to find that there was one in vegas. Originally I was going to give a 4 star review, but the hostess was so bad, she cost them a star. As I walked in she was texting on her cellphone, openly. She rudely insisted that she could seat my party until they were all here, even tho I said they were parking the car and walking in. She showed us the table and literally dropped the menus at the table. When I made the reservation I specified I needed a hair chair so before she left I requested a highchair. She barely glanced back and said they don't have highchairs they have boosters.  My son cannot sit up by himself yet, so he could not use the booster. This is a Japanese BBQ place, so I could not assist with cooking, I had to hold my son throughout my dinner.   Besides the useless hostess, the food is amazing here. The happy hour will only give you about a dollar off, but considering how many dishes you typically order, it's worth it. Don't be cheap with the meat! The hanger steak is about $7 but totally worth ordering at least 3 servings!   I went back in a few months later per the request of Aki, the VP. The  manager  Tracy was so resistant to help us. She only stopped by to review the bill embarrassingly in front of my guests. Tracy felt that a $12 discount compensating for my previous experience. That's ok.

I've never had Japanese style BBQ before, and being a big fan of grilling your own food at a restaurant, I was excited to try out this spot.  Walking into this restaurant, I really liked how they decorated this place. The dark woods, and mellow atmosphere really gave it a sexy vibe. I was digging it.  Gyu-Kaku might have the best grills I have ever seen. What makes them so great are the little vents that surrounds the grill. This makes the smoke disappear quickly, rather than engulf your clothes in meat smoke, which tends to happen at k-bbqs.  The first thing I ordered were the cheese wontons. Out of everything that I had ordered, this proved to be my least favorite. When I was thinking of a cheese wonton, I expected there to be a full pocket of cheese. That was not to be the case. Instead, there was the tiniest sliver of cheese that could be known to mankind. I should have taken a picture of that.  Then my meats came. I thought they were alright. I thought it was good, but I guess I was expecting more. Even though I came in during happy hour, I ordered like three dishes and spent quite a bit on them. Afterwards, I had to go buy a cheeseburger at a take out joint nearby because I was still pretty hungry.  The service here was not very good. The guy taking our order was very nice and accommodating, but he seemed lost at times. I constantly had to flag him down. And, he did mess up our order at the end of the night, charging us for extra things that we didn't order, but we were quickly able to fix the situation.  I don't know if I'll be back here. My experience was so-so. Maybe I'll come back here later in the future if they improve their service. But I thought the food was aight except for the cheese wontons, which were a ripoff.

The ramen had an unpleasant flavor to it that I can't quite identity and the tuna was not particularly fresh and the rice wasn't crispy enough.

There are so many choices and the pricing is very reasonable. You can do a la cart or enjoy their course menu.  We tried their special of the day which was Harami Skirt Steak, and we also ordered their Bistro Hanger Steak, Shishito peppers, bacon wrapped asparagus and their Shrimp Sukiyaki Bibimbap.   All were delicious but my favorite of the night was the Harami Steak which was so tender and made for the best grilled meat in my opinion.   Our server was very attentive and informative.  She changed our grill a couple of times and she made her presence known to us throughout our time here ensuring all was good. She really added to the dining experience and had no problem splitting up our checks.

The environment was very good.  Its hard to see such scale of restaurant locally.  The server told me that this restaurant cost about 2 million.  Each stove cost about 10 grand.  The smoke was sucked under neath, so your cloth will not smell after the meal. The menu looks pleasant. beautiful pictures.  Service was good.  He changed my grill 4 times during the meal.  These are all the good parts.  Now here comes the food.  the appetizer we ordered was spicy tuna volcano.  of 1 to 5, I will give it a one.  tuna has no flavor, the deep fried rice ball was hard.  two very different textures did not match well at all.  For the BBQ, I ordered scallop, Kalbi, Harami, Tongue, Chicken fondue.  They have 3 kinds of sauce, Ponzu, Sweet Soy, Spicy sauce.  The Ponzu was blend with out a kick or freshness.  The Sweet soy is too sweet that over powers the meat flavor easily, and you can just tell it was thickened by corn starch.  spicy sauce was Korean style base which was still on the sweet side.  So I am not impress with the sauce.  The scallop was fresh and I have no complaint.  But the meat is really just so so.  The reason is that the cut was bad.  some thick, some thin, some stringy, some wide.  they just want to make it to the weight, (which is only 4 to 5 oz. per order) for $9.00!  And they cut the meat along the grain.  which is a huge no no for bbq.  I feel like they want to cut cost by using the end parts and cut the meat any way they can to make the portion.  The marinate was too sweet and overpowering the meat flavor.  However the marinate flavor was not too bad, So if you like Korean bbq style, you will like it but If you like real Japanese BBQ, you should go try Yagyu( the 2 story building by the China town) They do it right.  The chicken, they use breast, which is very dry, and the fondue is just not what I am expecting when I am trying to eat bbq.  The cheese was overpowering.  The chicken was sticking on the grill.  The grill they use is metal, really easy to get blacken by the sweet sauce.  thats why the server has to change it so often(in the middle of your cooking)  I prefer Yagyu's.  They use cast iron grill, you can put a block of beef fat on it to enhance the flavor.  And the chicken will not stick.  Because yagyu is the first  Japanese  bbq place in town, so I compare between the two a lot.  For the draft beer, hands down yagyu is far better.  The mug was stored below freezing.  So when the beer comes, the whole mug is covered with frost and the beer was frozen in side the mug and float to the top.  If you are beer lover, you really have to go try Yagyu's draft beer.  Tonight's beer just looks sad.  And I don't like their rice.  To me, a perfectly cooked rice is just as important as the meat.  because you eat them together.  Rice brand or the type of grain of the rice was not good.  For $1.95 a bowl, they should put out something better.  Over all, for the environment, and if you want to impress some people, they will do the job.  The food is acceptable.  But for the bbq, Yagyu is the way to go.", "Date": "2014-09-20", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Tracy", "ReviewID": "KGycKvpZP9JEljTZNprfhw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!!

The ultra cool lit entrance begged the question...does Tron eat here?  Being seated while a female sung cover of Savage Garden's  Truly, Madly, Deeply  at 300 BPM's blared through the stereo made me think it possible if he were drunk.    We considered the course dinners priced at $55, $66 and $77 for a moment but saw a lot of filler that would have ended up untouched like cheese wontons, chicken cheese fondue, house salad, fried chicken (ok,ok, maybe one piece), calamari and S'mores.  Our initial server, Keiko, recommended we start with the spicy cabbage salad over the kim-chee.  Thankfully, we listened.  Crispy, spicy and dare I say refreshing?  It was a fine way to whet our appetite.           Standing out among with meats was the beef tongue and harami skirt steak.  Quality matched the price and both delivered on what decent yakiniku should be.  We also enjoyed the kalbi short rib and although the Angus beef ribs were a little too fatty for the wife, I happily devoured it.  The mushroom medley cooked in an unbeatable combination of soy sauce and butter was a nice side dish.    The only letdown was the  Spicy Kalbi Bibimbap .

From some of the other reviews, I'm not the only person who has gotten food poisoning from their meats here.  I eat rare steaks pretty often, so my body can handle a little rareness, but after eating here, my stomach has been turning for the past few days.  After several reviews that mention food poisoning and hair found in their food...cleanliness doesn't seem to be one of their main priorities here.  I sincerely hope it doesn't turn out like another Firefly's fiasco.  Besides that, the special drinks they have looked like it was created by a 12 year old.  I'll stick to the Sapporo...which by the way was a bit on the warm side.    The service was a bit  meh.   I understand its a new restaurant and all, but the servers were inattentive and some of them looked confused even.  Not a very well organized restaurant in my opinion, and definitely needs a LOT of improvement to live up to the Gyu Kaku namesake.  I've eaten at the ones in Japan and I was SO looking forward to this one popping up in Vegas.  This was a complete let down.    I usually don't write reviews, but this place deserves the ONE STAR I'm giving.  If I could give it ZERO, I would.

A tip for the Noobs:  You can have the meat marinated and prepared any way you want. I you just say I want the Kalbi. they will just bring you whatever they have done or just the plain cut. I think that most ot the people with marginal reviews here are because the reviewer did not know how to pick the meat.  My favorite meat/sauce combinations are: Kalbi miso Harami miso Garlic sirloin Toro beef gochujang Kalbi gochujang  If you aren't sure on the meat/sauce combo, then the best course is to order a set. I will be honest and say I'm not a fan of the prepared foods that come with the meal sets. The chicken karaage and cheese gyoza are just meh: fried fillers. The sushi is not anything special and I have to keep reminding myself that I'm here for meat not sushi. I don't expect Jiro level sushi but it's still mediocre even for American west coast standards.   Their happy hour is probably one of the best in town especially the late night super happy hour (red prices on the menu).  Gyu-Kaku is now the de facto place to go for Japanese yakiniku in Vegas.

I came here on a Monday night for their happy hour where selected meat/veggies are $1-2 cheaper than its original price.   ATMOSPHERE Very impressed with the atmosphere and interior. As opposed to the wooden benches/table and casual vibe of Gyu-Kaku in Japan, this place seemed more luxurious/fancy/modern. It made me wonder if Gyu-Kaku here incorporated Vegas's nightclub/flashy vibe to it. They have this cool lit entrance that makes you feel like you are walking on a red carpet for Grammy Awards. Interesting that they even have a bar..atmosphere here is way too cool for a BBQ restaurant.   SERVICE Service was excellent here. All the staffs here are energetic and attentive. Our server named Ryan was beyond fantastic. Since it was my first time at this location, he gave us suggestions, explained different sauces and the cooking time for specific meat. I was impressed with his enthusiasm and knowledge.  FOOD Good quality meat but kinda pricey for such a small portion in my opinion. I guess it's more about the quality over quantity here because meat was actually really good. I believe I got a Toro Shabu  which was thinly sliced beef and horumon which was my first time trying. 3 sauces they had were ponzu, spicy and sweet soy (?), I personally enjoyed dipping in the ponzu. Ponzu was citrusy and very refreshing, complimented the meat well.   CONCLUSION Will be back again for their happy hours!  [Edited to add] Second time around, completely ignored. Even though we had 3 servers walking by us/making eye contact, they acted as if we were not there. Finally after a good 10-20 mins, one of the servers came up to us only to tell us that kitchen is closed. First of all, why do you even have a poster around the entire restaurant which states happy hour is until 1AM. We were there around 12:30AM.. Yeah, if you guys didn't ignore us, maybe the kitchen wouldn't have been closed? Taking a star off.

I haven't tried Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ until now. It's available back in California and has been open here in Vegas for over a year now, but it never drew my attention until some friends agreed on it as a dinner destination.  We waited until 9:00pm for the start of happy hour (also available all day Mondays and Wednesdays and daily noon-6:30pm) to go. We had a reservation, although it didn't look very busy. The decor is welcoming and the place was very clean, perhaps owing somewhat to self-vacuuming grill helping to keep the restaurant and patrons' clothing free of residual meat smells. I have to confess that I was super tired during the meal in the  I can't focus on more than one thing  kinda way, but I really don't remember hearing any music whatsoever being played. Maybe it was soft and drowned out by conversation?  I deferred to someone else for the orders (a la carte of course), and I didn't get so much as a whiff at the receipt, so I won't be able to comment as much on specific dishes as I would like. Our approach ended up being like a  tasting  because we shared their portions with five instead of just two or three, so definitely don't be afraid to duplicate orders in larger groups.  Miso soup ($0.99 happy hour, $1.95 regular): it's a standard miso soup, but even in the small bowl, it's a relative bargain during happy hour. Get it if you don't flat out hate miso soup.  Gyu-Kaku Salad ($5.50 HH, $6.50 reg): I don't even wanna know what the half order looks like. Even considering our modest split, the portion seems small, and the dish isn't especially memorable even though it was good at the time. Skip this.  Fried Chicken Karaage ($3.95/$4.95): this is actually one of several dishes that are even more deeply discounted during  Super Happy Hour  after 11pm, but no way were we waiting that long. It was the best appetizer that I sampled tonight, and the rich creamy sauce is balanced out by a squeeze of lemon.  Fried Calamari ($4.95/$5.95): skip this. The squid was boring and slightly rubbery. There is absolutely nothing special about it. It's like a pricier, less impressive version of the karaage since it comes with the same sauce and lemon.  Pork Gyoza Dumplings ($3.50/$4.95): also a skip. It's good but unmemorable to a similar extent as the salad.  Corn w/ cheese ($3.95): pretty good, maybe not worth the price. I love corn, but you start to question your sanity with these prices for veggies. That's part of the appeal of AYCE joints, which this is not an example of - you feel like you can still get your veggies while maintaining value. But on that note, I would get the zucchini ($2.95) again, and if I go for Super Happy Hour, I'll most likely get the normal corn at $1.99.  I won't pretend to know all of the meats that I had, especially considering that my friend ended up cooking and distributing everything (on that note, not posting any grill meats photos), but I'm absolutely certain that the Toro Beef ( beef bacon  for $3.95/$4.95) was a rockstar dish, and I'm sure the Yaki-Shabu (beef chuck roll, same price as the previous item) and Angus Beef Ribs (ditto on price) were also delicious. Although ponzu and spicy sauce (separately or in combination) will probably be your mainstays, I believe the beef ribs were the one that somehow worked especially well with the sweet soy sauce. Just be sure to rely on the sauces to fill out the flavor because this ain't no Korean BBQ joint.  It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows though. Duck breast ($6.95/$7.95) and beef tongue w/ scallion sauce ($8.95) were both notably underwhelming. Actually, I don't even remember amidst the confusion which piece was the duck breast. As for the beef tongue, the meat itself was fine, but the scallion sauce didn't do much for me. Maybe I expected it to be a little more cooked and buttery, but it just seemed raw (but how do you cook it on a wire mesh?) and therefore out of place.  Lastly, dessert was a bit of a downer. The macaron ice creams were decent but not worth the $5. I liked the green tea ice cream inside a strawberry shell, and also the mango. I didn't enjoy the taro shell w/ vanilla as much.  All in all, I enjoyed most of the meats, and happy hour pricing was pretty nice, so I would consider trying Gyu-Kaku again.

The mushrooms medley were good but once again a bit too salty for my taste. There are 3 sauces to dip in so I think thy should have went lighter on the marinate.

Their HH is not the best value ever as most items were only $1-2 dollars off (not half off like most places).  As soon as we were seated our server brought waters and turned on the grill.  Our server was absolutely wonderful, helpful, friendly, and every time he dropped off a raw item he gave us advice on how to cook it.   . $57.40 got us a gyu salad (half portion), an order of spring rolls, infusion edamame, chicken karaage, garlic rice, white rice, cheesy corn, duck breast, kobe beef, shrimp, and filet mignon.   .  Gyu-Kaku Salad (half portion is $3.95)- Romaine I think with hard-boiled egg, some sort of radish on top (maybe daikon?), red pepper, cucumber, tomatoes, and a dressing sort of like thousand island.  It was fresh and crispy and I liked it.  .  Vegetable Spring Rolls ($2.99)-Lovely crispy thin wonton wrapper and was served piping hot but unfortunately the inside was total mush.  I would pass on these.   .  Infusion edamame ($3.50)- Cooked well but was swimming in an orange fat and garlic which I was burping up all day.  Although it was tasty, I do not recommend it if you have a sensitive tummy.  .  Chicken Karaage ($2.99) Delicious slivers of dark meat chicken fried to a perfect crisp with an orange mayo-based sauce.  Just get five orders of this and don't share.   . Garlic rice ($3.99) Very large portion but tasted awful to me.  Rice was overcooked and mushy but it was full of raw garlic and piles of sauteed onions.  I would pass on this.  Definitely don't eat this if you have a date because you will not be called for a second date.    . Cheesy corn ($3.95) Maybe 4 spoon-fuls of canned corn and the cheese was missing.  Not impressed.  . Duck breast ($6.95) I wasn't expecting duck at a yakiniku place but it was very fresh and each piece had a nice strip of fat.  It was delicious.   .  Kobe flat-iron steak ($12.95) So tender and delicious.  Nice marbling of fat.  Didn't even need sauce with this one.  Highly recommend.   .  Garlic Shrimp ($5.95) Shrimp were huge and succulent but the garlic marinade was somewhat chemical-tasting.  Did not enjoy.   . Filet mignon ($6.95) 21 day dry aged chunks of filet mignon.  Incredibly tender and delicious, although they really needed some salt or dipping sauce.   .  Everything was tasty and fun but rather expensive and my husband and I spent the next two days in the restroom (SORRY TMI) so either they served us some questionable food or we are just pansies that can't handle their food.

As gyu Kaku regulars my bf and I love their HH and the food. We stopped on a sat afternoon on a road trip from Southern California and decided this was a good spot to refuel and have dinner. There was 1 older gentleman as our waiter, serving 4 tables (we were one of them). Our meat took much longer than we have ever had to wait..and it was HH portions. We were first served our veggies- corn and spinach. Consumed that and our meat was still not served. Finally our meat arrived. Just one 6 slices of garlic steak. Our next 2 orders did not arrive until let's put it this way- the grill was already burnt and charred.  Those next two orders of meat were hard to even flip over, again, obviously because the grill was burnt and charred! We alerted our waiter, asking if we can change grill, and he just lowered the temperature of the grill. That was pretty annoying, esp since we are regulars at this place and our waiters change our the grill even before we have to ask. To be honest, after sitting in the car for a road trip for 4 hours and not having the normal practice standards of this establishment was quite annoying!

Brought my mom in for the experience but the grill ended up being messed up and only half of it was hot to cook anything. It took forever for our meats to not even cook evenly. Waitress was well aware that that our stove wasn't working, was nice enough to offer to switch us tables until she found a solution of taking the inside piece of the grill off so that it was just the bare flame. Again, it worked for a bit but it was only a small flame on one side of the grill. There was no point to move tables at that point since we've already eaten most of our meats. For the price that you pay for the meats here, you should be able to enjoy every piece, unlike AYCE kbbq where you just force eat every meat in sight. Imagine eating a soggy piece of beef with no char at all or even having a meat take 5 minutes to even get to medium rare when it's supposed to take 2 minutes or less. The flame was so low that it took the whole visit for our broccoli to cook and by that time our cheese fondue had evaporated. Annoyed at the experience and will not be coming back again.

I tried to Kalbi,  New York Steak, and the filet mignon.  All cooked perfectly (because I grilled it duh)  The sides were kind of A mixed between American and Korean dishes.

Its japanese barbecue I can tell you that, but it aint that good. Place is dirty too. Its unnoticeable, but its there. The food there is expensive and extremely unsatisfying. Service isnt good either.  Ill start off what matters to me: food because we all love it. The meat is barely okay and priced at a plate of 6 pieces of tuna sashimi from Las Vegas. Its just not good. I got a decent variety of things there that I cant remember the names of and all I know it wasnt good.  The service seemed like a joke. I waved a dozen times and even spoke up to the waiters with common phrases like  excuse me  which escalated to  hey, man cmon , but nothing came up after 10 minutes. After 10 minutes of stuggling to get attention from a waiter thats walking up in down with nothing in his hand everytime, he made eye contact with me as I raised my tired hand like an attaenna reaching for the heavens. EYE CONTACT WITH ME WAVING AT HIM. Even then I got no service. 5 minutes later I got their attention after leaning out of my booth raising my hand.  The environment is dim, so thats nice and relaxing, but looks can be deceiving. I was just sitting there forcing myself into thinking the expensive meat I had ordered was good and I noticed someone cleaning a table. Nothing to look at really, but as I eat my bbq I catch something in my peripheral vision. The person cleans the bottom the table first and uses the same rag, without any rinsing, to clean the top. The place has tabletop grills, so the bottom is naturally going to be dirtier than the top. Then I drop a peice of over priced meat on the table and was forced into throwing it away after seeing such a thing. Finally, they had music playing. Not any other music, but music youd hear from the first two DDRS. I think I even heard Butterfly play. Its humorous for a place that tries to be elegant with dim lighting and a lot of partitions.  As I sip my cup of refreshing water, I gazed upon something I wish I hadnt noticed. There was dirt floating to the top of my water.  Oh. Just don't get water here then  is what I thought, but then I looked more closely into the cup. What i thought made my drink filthy was the ice. I almost puked thinking of the idea of literally everyone in the place with ice in their drinks having a chance of getting ill from a restaurants carelessness. So I decided to get a drink without ice, but woah... dirt was still there. So it mustve been the dishes being carelessly cleaned. I genuinely wonder how clean the back of the house is now.  Pros: they sure know how to hide dirt with dim lighting, and a neat enterance.  Cons: dirty place, bad service, and mediocre food.  Advice: bring your dance pants to get jiggy with the music, reach out of your booth to get someones attention, and try to inspect your cup or plates for any filth.  Im not much of a complainer at all, but I feel like Ashton Kutcher was waiting for me to leave so he can pop out telling me I got Punkd as he points to various plants claiming there was a camera in it.

They also offer some decent deals during happy hour; plus they have pre fixe dinner combos that seem like they would be a good option for some: ranging from $55, $66, $77.77 and in addition to 20% off those set prices during happy hour. Happy hour is daily 5-6:30pm & 9-close.  We prefer selecting our few favorites from the menu so we went the a la carte route. Here's our favorites of the evening:  Garlic herb Filet mignon $7.95 - it was tender and grilled nicely on the tabletop grill.  Bacon asparagus $4.95 - bacon makes everything better.  Spicy pork $3.95 - classic Korean style spicy pork - mild, but cooked well on the grill and a great cheap meat dish to get your fill.  Angus ribs $4.95 - tender, juicy and seasoned well.  Miso $1.95 - traditional style, comforting, came out piping hot, and a plus it's not watered down!  Spicy tuna volcano $5.95 - it's packed up with a load of crispy fried rice, but if you eat it carefully, you can reserve some of that extra crispy rice and enjoy it with your grilled meats. I highly recommend that!  Beef tongue $7.95 - very tender and you can't go wrong! I love it.  Scallion sauce $1 - order this sauce. Order lots of it!!! The beef tongue and the rest of the grilled meats paired perfectly with this sauce.  Crunchy garlic sauce $1 - an oily bomb, but don't fret, the crispy charred garlic and spice bits are actually really tasty with the grilled meats- so scoop away!  Rice $1.95 - we really didn't need to order the rice, but one order was more than enough to share between 2 adults (just make sure you took my tip about the spicy tuna volcano's crispy rice above and you'd be set for success!)   Pass on these: Toro beef $3.95 - dried out, chewy  Yakishabu $3.95 - dried out, very chewy Corn butter $2.95 - skip! Canned corn and not special in any way Garlic mushroom $2.95 - it was also very basic, so it's worth passing on, but if you're a mushroom lover like us, it may be worth a try   What made this place just OK to me, was their sauces. The sauce makes or breaks Japanese BBQ and theirs were lacking authenticity. They offer 3 tabletop sauces: ponzu, sweet soy, and spicy, which are are mediocre and could use some extra love. They each tasted basic as if they were purchased bottled from the asian section at the grocery store. Leaves a lot to be desired, you feel me? Well, if I had to choose a favorite it would definitely be the spicy one. Had a nice tang and slight sweetness to it; not spicy in the slightest.

Recently though, came to have dinner with my mom on 5/3/15, and was seated at a table with an obnoxious party next to us separated by one of their dividers. Two blonde chicks were loud, irritating, and wholly inappropriate (they were grabbing at each other's underwear).

They talked to each table and spent time to actually have a conversation weather that be in relation to the restaurant or of just random topics, they made everyone laugh and assured no one left disappointed- Even the staff seemed to be happy with Managers who were(at the time): Karsten, and Shayna-Marie. Servers were quick with refills, knowledgable with menu, and did not wait long to have our food out and even explained proper cook times as well as sanitation advice.   Great food should you choose the right marinade for your meat, along with the right choice of appetizers/sides ect. togo with it.

The service, the quality of the meat and the overall experience were always top-notch. The prices were good too.  So when I found out they were opening a Gyu-Kaku here in Vegas I was pretty stoked. The Korean BBQ places are a good substitute but not the same. I've been a few times since the opening and have always found the food to be good and the service is on point too. I usually make reservations to be safe but I've never had to wait more than a couple of minutes when I just walk in for dinner.  For whiskey fans they have a good selection of Japanese whiskys at the bar and the prices are good too. Bartender told me that their price on Hibiki is the lowest in the valley. I can't verify that but it was low enough for me to throw back a couple of glasses before dinner without thinking twice.  Gyu-Kaku doesn't do AYCE in Vegas (I don't think they do it in CA either) but they have some great meal plans that will bring out enough meat and veggies to where you will be full when you are done.

I tried three drinks, including the mint apple, one with blue curacao and lychee (delicious!) and a raspberry one (a little tart for me but still good). It's probably one of the cheapest places to drink since the cocktails are $3-$5 during happy hour. Can't beat that!  And the food, as always, was delish.  Their calamari and cheese wontons are must haves.

For the side veggies, broccoli and mushroom medley which are served with butter wrapped in tin foil to grill. The kimchee was pretty standard.   For the meat selections, I ordered the Japanese sausages served with whole grain mustard for dipping which were pretty good. Also Kalbi short ribs, filet mignon, yaki-shabu and the spicy pork were delicious. The garlic shrimp was way too salty, too much garlic salt!

Super awesome bright entrance!   We walk in....pretty setting. Totally wanted to eat on the floor tables.   We get a booth and we were game. I was looking forward to coming here, but after I tried getting a few people's attention and them just looking away acting like I don't exist, i got a bit annoyed. I get it, our table isn't there's, but when my hands in your face and I say excuse me, at least acknowledge it. It took a good 15-20 mins for someone to ask if we've been helped. It just sucks it took someone to wail there hands around like those blow up guys in front of car dealerships to get their attention.  We got Andrew, and he was phenomenal. Great customer service. He told us what the menus about, but since we waited so long, we already knew what we wanted. Get a la carte! No point on getting the combo. Too expensive, and you might not get everything you may want to try.   The meat was OK, but not to die for. Small portion for each meat you order. They range from $5-$8. Not unless you get the Kobe, then that's about $20. We also got a couple appetizers. The garlic chicken and the calamari. Again, not to die for. Also, those were the worlds smallest fried calamari I've ever had from any restaurants I've ever been in.   Crunchy garlic sauce ppl were raging about...ehh.   The real reason I gave this 3 stars, which I think I'm being generous, is because from the corner of my eye I saw one of the ladies cleaning the table top with a dirty rag. I saw her wipe the grill from underneath and saw just dust and black muck on the rag. She then folds the rag, which is thin, and wipes the tables down with it. Then the booth and chairs. Soooo, ew. At least wipe the table top first, yanno?   Oh! And that playlist they played, I swear all the songs were from the 90's. They got that DDR music playing and made me wanna play it. Hah!

My favorite items on their menu are the duck breast and Japanese pork sausages. I'm not a huge fan of their beef items because they put some sort of sauce on them. I prefer the beef plain for grilling. I would suggest skipping the course menus and just getting exactly what you want a-la-carte. The course meals, for me, had too many items I wouldn't normally order. There's plenty of seating and the space reminds me of a mainstream yakiniku(grilled meat) restaurant in Tokyo.

I SUGGEST getting a meal plan then adding more sides or meat, it's a better deal.  I've been here many time but finally found the time to review this place. Gyu-Kaku's meat selection is great and the prices aren't too bad. I like Japanese BBQ because the grills and vents are different from Korean BBQ. When you leave gyu-kaku you won't leave smelling like oily meats. Happy hour deals are awesome!  SERVICE Their service was wonderful, they are knowledgable on the items on the menu. They check if you're doing well with the food and change your grill when needed. The servers also tell you how much time is needed to cook your meat and vegetables.   FOOD Good quality meat but portions not great. My favorite is beef tongue and it comes with small portions unfortunately. They offer spicy, sweet soy, and ponzu sauce. The ponzu sauce goes well with most of the meats (for my preference). Ponzu is citrusy and it's refreshing. The sweet soy seems familiar to Maggie's soy sauce but sweeter. The spicy is a mix of garlic and spices.

Growing up in Hawaii where we have many yakiniku places, I've yet to have tried one here in Las Vegas.  I gave this place a 3 star review - I normally don't give such low scores but this restaurant really needs to fine tune their customer service and wait staff skills.  The beginning of our evening was a rough start, but Lily and Anthony did their best to make sure we left with smiles on our faces.  When we entered in the place there was no one to greet us at the host station, so we waited...  I wandered around and it seemed there were only two or three people actually working. This was at 6pm, usual time for dinner, I reached out to one of the employees and we were seated immediately.  We sat and perused the menu and had random conversation, during which time we noticed another table was being seated.  While we waited for our server we noticed the new table that was seated was having their drinks delivered to their table yet no one has even bothered to come to our table to get our drink order...and we're a pretty thirsty bunch!  Irritated, one of my coworkers ask a worker to please take our drink order pointing out another table was seated way after we had already been sat.  Again, not a good start. We ordered everything, drinks and food. [Thank you Anthony who let us know he wasn't a server but took our order anyways.]  Our waitress Lily, as pleasant as she was, started delivering food and some of our drinks. It should've been drinks first and not random food dish items at the same time. What happens there is, my coworkers received their starter dish and no drinks while I received my drinks and no starters. This causes a very awkward and unpleasant experience.  Overall, the food was good. Nothing spectacular, the gyoza is of the pre-made family - I hate that in any Asian restaurant I go to, and I can tell frozen from a fresh handmade dumpling.  The meats were delicious, the poké was good that we order two dishes of it.   This place may have a good chance if they tidied up the experience and fine tuned their waitstaff' customer service.

I realized why which i'll get to later in the review.  Setting: In a fairly large and quiet plaza by the vietnamese market and near the smokin crawfish restaurant. When you see this place you almost get the feeling why something that looks so nice be located here? Bright white lights and modern decor make it out to be a high class establishment so taking a date here would definitely give the impression of quality.   Choosing your food: You can go a la carte or choose the set meals they offer. Personally I think choosing the set is your best bet for the first time and choosing a la carte the second visit when you know which meats are right for you.   Meats: They offer several cuts of meat and prepared with different types of marinades which is a big problem for me. All of the meat is in some type of sauce and seasoning which overburdens the meat and ruins its true flavors. Yeah I know some meats are suppose to be marinated (kalbi, bulgogi, etc) but all of their meats seem to be soaking in sauce. I think we can all agree that marbled meat is the best meat. The beef items that we got on the meat lovers seemed pretty tough and chewy which is a big disappointment.   Happy Hour: All day monday and wednesday is pretty sweet! A good amount of the items on the menu are about $1 some $2 off. A mug of sapporo during the summer happy hour was only $1.50.   Overall: I think it's a cool place to go for a nice evening of drinking, grilling, and chatting with a group of people, but all the meat being marinated and pretty tough fails to want me to come again for food.", "Date": "2016-09-02", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Clint", "ReviewID": "Xj0VnDV3A3Si5N1eCYCNnA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "There's some decent barbecue here.

It's better to order a la carte instead of going with the meal deals, in my opinion, and skip stuff you may not really want like salad, soup and edamame. Proteins like the harm miso skirt steak and kale short rib don't take long to cook but can benefit from leaving them on the grill to get a little crispy around the edges.

Don't walk in expecting to become super full unless you have a small stomach or are ready to shell out some money! I think around $20-25 per person would be good to adequately fill someone up. I always /have/ to get a bowl of rice in order to help fill me up when I usually don't get one,  For the appetizers, my favorites are the Ahi Tuna Poke, Spicy Tuna Volcano, & Wakame Seaweed Salad. It's been a while since I've had the Ahi Tuna and the Spicy Tuna, but I remember that I definitely enjoyed those the most. Out of all of the meats I've tried, the Toro Beef & the Harami Miso Skirt Steak are definitely my favorites. The Harami definitely has the most flavor out of the ones I've tried. Honestly, all the meats are packed with a lot of flavor; however, I remember the New York Steak not being too special for me. If I had to suggest meats for first timers, get the Harami, Toro Beef, Bistro Hanger Steak, & Filet Mignon.  The price is a little too high for me with the portions that are given for each item, but the quality is definitely there. They also provide sweet soy, spicy, and ponzu sauces for your meat, but you don't really need it since you don't have to worry about the meat not having any flavor.  I can't see myself going to Gyu-Kaku unless it's during Happy Hour since the price/portion ratio seems a little off to me.

Everything we had on the table cooked for such a long time. I was so mad, to top it off the garlic noodle served on that day was bland.   After the meal I asked a different server if our grill was faulty (usually they change the burnt grills at least two times whenever we dine here).  We finished and the grill top wasn't even burnt. He said,  yeah this booth specifically had trouble heating.   The fact that we could've relocated to a different table when you knew that the one we were sitting at was faulty.

I like all different kinds of food. I had never done this style of table-top grilling before, and so decided to try it out.   I started out with a  Southern Mai Tai .  I should have read the menu a bit closer, because it is actually nothing at all like a Mai Tai. It tasted like cool aid with booze. (The  Southern  was Southern Comfort. Not a fan.)  We ordered several plates from beef to veggies. When they arrived, I asked the server for her recommendation on cook times. She casually listed them off,  30 seconds each side for the scallops, 45 seconds total for the beef...  Sadly, should could not have been more wrong. Either she was terribly misinformed or the grill was awfully cool.   The scallops took about five minutes to become opaque. The beef took several minutes - even though the slices were very thin.  Folks here talk about the great prices. I suppose it depends on what you order. Four dollars for four stalks of asparagus? I'd say that's a bit steep. ...and then you have to cook it.   ... and it is all cooked on a smoke-free gas grill - which adds no flavor at all. I love smokey flavors - especially in a 'grill' or 'barbeque' meal.  Give me a cast-iron skillet and a campfire any day.  Spices were modest to the point of being absent. Conversely, the sauces on the table were overpowering. Not recommended.  The Bibimbop was fine. The salmon was also fine once it cooked - but again, I can do better at home.  Good company and a friendly server made this a good hang.

Service: When we first discovered Gyu-Kaku, the service was prompt, attentive ad courteous.  Fast forward 3-4 months later, we waited for seats in a half empty restaurant.  Our meats were not served at the same time.  As in we went through 6 different meats and then the 7th showed up.  This was after we ate the first 6.  And this was just my husband and I dining.  Not to mention the disappearing soda refill that appeared 10 minutes later. Not happy since he was now a grumpy lunch date.  Food Taste: We love the taste of the food here. Simple. Easy. Delicious. It helps when you're the chef! I haven't purchased any pre-cooked items from the kitchen.  Food Quality: I have to admit that Gyu-Kaku is highly consistent with their cuts of meat and seasonings. Tender Filet Mignon! Beefy Angus Beef Ribs. Chicken seasoned impeccably.    Price: Happy Hour is a steal!  And there are two time periods 5-6:30 and after 9pm.

The  spicy tuna volcano  (AKA spicy tuna crispy rice, $4 for 4 pieces during HH) was not as good as others in town, but the shrimp ponzu tacos were crispy and adventurous.  As for the meats: choose 3/person and add a bowl of the GARLIC RICE to share. I love that it's served in stone bowl to crisp up and tossed tableside. Definitely get the TONGUE WITH SCALLION SAUCE and the GARLIC SHRIMP ($4 for 4 shrimp, currently on special, regularly $7). If you don't like garlic and onions, maybe don't bother because those were the best dishes.  Other solid options were the spicy gochugang pork belly, bistro hangar steak, toro beef, and basil chicken- all good but not great, smaller portions than other similar style restaurants for similar prices.

We wanted to be excited. Perhaps, I wanted to love it and was overly excited to try somewhere new? Well, whichever it was...it was anticlimatic for me. My husband's review,  it wasn't so bad . They offered internal organs, of course he'll have such of an opinion.   We came in on a Tuesday not too long after they opened. Immediately greeted...check. Seated...check. I was completely excited to look over their menu, especially since we happen to arrive during Happy Hour. For some reason I still can't figure out, their happy hour menu wasn't as impressive. I suppose it was because the food itself wasn't.   ME:  Fusion edamame (garlic seasoned edamame) Spicy Tuna Volcano (crispy rice with spicy tuna on top) Beef tacos (won ton wrapper fried into a taco shape with bulgogi squeezed in) Miso Butterfish (butterfish in miso sauce with a pepper wrapped in foil to simply toss onto the grill)  HUSBAND: Tako wasabi  Liver (waiter said it was pork liver) Beef Toro Spicy Tuna Volcano Miso Butterfish  US: 2 Kirin beer  There was nothing spicy or even tuna about this dish. The crispy rice seemed to have more.flavor than the spicy tuna. To jazz it up I made it rain with a bottle of some sauce they have on the table labeled as spicy. But that wasn't spicy at all.   I do love they offer sweet potatoe FRIES. Having some kind of finger food for a 9months old to grasp and keep occupied is an immediate thumber-upper from me.  Miso Butterfish was alright. The sauce it steams in is very light in taste, which is a good thing for such a fish.  You get a small piece of fish, thankfully, it wasn't a small and thin piece.  Nothing spectacular. Since I do love eating fish, I still appreciated it.   The beef tacos weren't anything spectacular either. Maybe if they slid in 2 more pcs I wouldve said they were deeelish! Just wasnt enough bite for me to thoroughly assess. A little expensive for what you get happy hour or not. Man, I'm starting to think I came in way too hungry.   Can't review on the liver, I don't eat that stuff. Husband said twas alright. He did note that the Tako wasabi was his favorite and thought twas pretty good. So if you are into the raw stuff, that just may be your deal.  The beef Toro to me didn't look too fresh...freshly frozen...freshly defrosted frozen...freshly flashed frozen? Whichever...just didn't have that nice color to the meat the way I'm accustomed to seeing at Gangnam. It was marinated in something but upon eating it, I couldn't even taste it out.   Prices were alright considering it was happy hour. I think I was overly excited in my head so perhaps I was expecting more. I would probably come again just to give it another shot. Maybe during a time when they didnt just open...maybe the food needed time to marinate longer?   The best part about our meal was our 1.99 kirin beer, my fusion edamame (which was a small bowl for almost 4bucks), and my husband's Tako (small bowl.for almost 4 bucks). We spent 55 bucks, which I walked out wishing we had just went to an AYCE sushi for even less.   I enjoyed the vibe of the restaurant, and it being well ventilated. There were a couple times our waiter lagged in service. We were nearly done eating by the time he brought our beer out. I suppose since this was noon on a weekday, we had nowhere to go...we didn't really care much. Sometimes just laying back and not having the urgency for anything is soothing to the nerves. Aside from that, overall, service was great and super friendly.  Again, I'd have to come back.. maybe less hungry too. Sometimes hunger can change your palate for sure. But for now, I don't feel like I'm missing out on life if I never did return.   Definitely kid and stroller friendly!

First thing I noticed right when I walked in was that they have a full bar here. From what I remember, the Gyus I've been to in LA served just beer and sake. This would be a great place to come and watch a game while sippin on an Old Fashioned or havin a couple beers and some finger food.   Menu hasn't changed much. They still have happy hour all day except from 6PM-8PM. Their lunch sets are great. Rice, salad, miso soup, and two types of selected meats for just $10 is a great deal, and the lunch sets are available from 12PM-4PM. They still have the big sets if you wanna bring a large group and get down and rowdy. I feel like they go overboard with the marinade sometimes, but I'll just ask for the meats plain next time. The sukiyaki bibimbap is as good as I remember it to be.  Vegas has definitely upped its BBQ game, bringing in Gyu-kaku and an abundance of other Korean bbq spots. I've been to Gyu-kaku so many times in SoCal that I feel like I've been Gyu-Kaku'd out.

Interior was nicely decorated with a fusion of traditional and modern Japanese elements throughout.  Music, on the other hand, can be overbearing as EDM blast through the speakers.  Nonetheless, ambiance is perfect for a date night or dinner with a group of friends.  Haven't really considered of going back to any KBBQ joints since dining at this restaurant for the first time!  Consider it some sort of awakening due to the array of items one can enjoy in such great quality.  No AYCE here but they do offer different full course dinners priced at $55, $66 and $77 that can easily feed 2-4 people.  They also have Happy Hour specials from 1700-1830 and 2100-closing with several discounted items from the menu.  One thing I'd like to point out is how awesome their grills are.  Small vents actually surround the cooking area which makes the smoke dissipate before it can even engulf guests so they don't end up smelling like grilled meat afterwards.  We usually opt for their meat lover's course which is a great way to sample different cuts of meat in various marinades.  The meal starts out with miso soup and house salad as well cheese wontons and garlic fried chicken.  The spread is then followed by the main entree comprised with six different meat items.  To top it all off, s'mores to end the dinner; grill comes off so guests can toast marshmallows straight on the heat.  Overall, Gyu-Kaku is definitely the better alternative to KBBQ...better yet, a great replacement if I must say.  Top notch food quality and superb customer service.

Not smoky/smelly for a yakiniku place - no changing table in the restroom.(4) value: recommend coming in for lunch on Wednesday (all day happy hour) as the lunch combinations are the things to get. 10% locals discount can be used with coupons offered through their app. (3.5 starred review)  Since Opentable.com now only offers rewards at limited restaurants in Vegas, we are more likely to hit this place more often (can be redeemed here and Buca Di beppo....I frankly prefer here).  Lunch is way better pricing than dinner so we hit them up for their lunch sets. I usually get their Meat lover's set for $10.95 which comes with 4 types of meat at 2oz each, a small salad, gyoza, soup and rice. It's a good portion of food and quite filling. They also have a create your own options are well at $9.95 for 2 BBQ items and $12.95 for 3 items which comes with soup, salad and rice. They also have non-grilled lunch sets like to the hamburger steak or bibimbap bowl for less than $13.  The meats are the highlights here.  The quality here is pretty good.The marinated meats are slightly on the sweeter side and very tender. Cooking over the grill is nice due to the great ventilation system (i.e. not smelly or too smokey).   The miso soup is pretty standard. The salad is largely made of daikon and kind of heavy on the mayo. Gyoza also ho-hum and I probably would not order it unless it was in a set.  For dessert, they have Lady M green tea crepe cake brought in... probably from LA. Ours was served with ice cream even though the signs in the restaurant says that it doesn't. (Maybe it's just me but I don't know what all the fuss is about.) They also have macaroon ice cream sandwiches from Brick (it's an LA thing) which I haven't tried but am pretty intrigued.  Service is good and fast generally. Ambience is modern with loud dance music playing. As for bringing kids here, I guess kids and grills don't mix well - hence the lack of changing tables in the bathroom. Just saying.  The value here is when you apply the discounts here on top of coming in for lunch. Locals get 10% off, dinner sets for 2 are 20% off on Saturday and Sunday.

We were informed that Monday's were happy hour and we each got delicious drinks. We ordered some appetizers. Although we didn't need to. Our meal for 2 fed all three of us easily. I ordered the cabbage salad. It was light and delicious. I liked the sauce they used. We also ordered some calamari. It was ok. I didn't care for the breading or the sauce that came with it.  We ordered the  meats  dinner for 2 I believe. It came with Miso soup, a salad, a ton of meat, and dessert. We ordered extra sides of spinach, broccoli, and shrimp. Our server was very sweet. With each dish he brought out, he told us how to cook it and for how long. The cool thing is you can vary your cook time depending on your taste. I like my red meat a little more rare so I cooked it for less time.   The only meat I didn't care for, was the pesto chicken. The garlic shrimp was particularly good.

I would like to go back the next time I'm in town.", "Date": "2015-11-16", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Katherine", "ReviewID": "vozEidCzUerVEOjKOhT0Zw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I've been hearing people rave about this place in Cali and couldn't wait for it to open!  Gyu-Kaku welcomes you with a grand entry way lit with lights, it definitely doesn't feel like I'm still in Vegas while walking in.  We were seated right away and our server explained the menu to us and suggested ordering off their course menus ($55-$77).  We opted for a la carte because we thought we'd save more money and be able to eat what we wanted, but our bill came out to $60 anyway.    We started off with the Asian Sangria in Apple.  It's made with Hana Sake, fruits, mandarin, orange, mint and sprite.  The sangria was fruity, refreshing, and delicious!  If you're looking for something to sip on that doesn't burn your throat, this is the winner!   Spicy Tuna Volcano: a block of rice that's fried with spicy tuna on top.  Although it's a best seller, I wouldn't order it again.  The rice was too fried and hard to chew. I've seen it executed better at ayce sushi.  Our server recommended 2 plates of meat and 2 plates of vegetables per person and an appetizer to be full.  I initially thought it was a lot of food, but I didn't realize how small the portions would be.    We ordered the Bistro Hanger Steak, Duck, and Angus Beef Ribs with the sauces that were recommended for each on the menu.  When we got our meats, I couldn't believe how fresh they looked, each plate came with 5-6 pieces of meat, so don't expect to get ayce full. It's more about the quality than quantity here.  I also enjoyed the 3 different sauces on the table that you could dip your meats in!  They also have additional sauces you can pay for to enhance the flavor of the meats, we decided to go with the Crunchy Garlic Sauce.  It's crunchy garlic in red chili oil, but with all the sauces at the table, I didn't find it necessary.  Everything had so much flavor already so no need to pay extra.    For vegetables, we got the Mushroom Medley, which came with Enoki, King Oyster, and Garlic Mushroom and Spinach Garlic.  Both were good additions to the meat.  They come in foil and you steam it on your grill alongside with the meat.     Rice isn't included in a la carte, so we ordered 2 bowls at $1.95 each.    I love how you don't smell like bbq afterwards and the service is beyond amazing!  I'll definitely be back to try their course menu and their HH menu which is from 5-6 pm and 10 pm-12 am.  Just be mindful that you're gonna have to pay a little more than you're used to, to get full.", "Date": "2014-10-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Katie", "ReviewID": "14PNZov0Z5LPPjwQO-Y7KQ", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Food was decent.  Service was okay til we were finished n waited FOREVER for the checks.  The waitress overcharged one of my friends by $23.  Luckily they get texts from their bank and noticed before we left.  My bf and I split the Meat Lovers which comes w/6 kinds of meat, salad, miso soup, rice (which we had to ask for halfway through our meal), cheese wontons (they were good but just a dab of cheese..not what we expected) and garlic fried chicken for $55.  I'd rather go to KBBQ n get AYCE for $5 more per person.  The sides here are extra..$5 for onions?  Yea right!  Portions aren't that big....got maybe 5-6 small pieces of meat for each dish.

We were so excited to try this place out!  The entrance to this perceived Japanese   BBQ place is pretty amazing with its door framed lights, pretty befitting for it's placement in Las Vegas.   However I would be stretching it by saying it should be categorized as a Japanese BBQ restaurant. There was definitely a DIY BBQ pit in the center of the table, which is always the expectation but the menu was not what we expected. The quality of the meats were good but very thick cuts for BBQ beefs and the lean meats. Also everything came pre-marinaded, which is something definitely not Japanese like plus the marinades were all very sweet for my taste. There were also lots of Korean dishes that also were on the menu, I felt this place was more of a Korean Japanese inspired BBQ restaurant and really should be categorized that way.   Overall the service was great, quality of food good, happy hour is very reasonable, lots of speciality Asian inspired cocktails but undeniable not Japanese BBQ, it really missed it's mark by claiming itself as one.", "Date": "2015-01-31", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "AJ", "ReviewID": "5v_tkM3zYAU6gW_3LL-2GQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "A modern Japanese restaurant.

Didn't really think it'd be enough for the both of us, but I ended up getting a food coma as if I had all you can eat kbbq. Starting from the appetizers, everything was so flavorful. You end up wondering just how good the next course will be. Photos are attached, but tbh, I was too excited to eat that I did not take as many as I had wanted to in the beginning.  As for service, I believe I counted around 5 that came to us, asking if we needed anything in the most polite manner.   The interior was beautiful, extracting older Japanese themes with a modern touch. My experience here seems very worthy of the 5 star rating I've given. I would note that the price is higher than your average casual dinner, but it is worth both the experience and the food.", "Date": "2014-12-23", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Scott", "ReviewID": "Ve2vogMjycCaErO2GvYztw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "This place is amazing!!!! I love the friendly greeting as soon as you walk in. The waiting area is nice, just in case you have to wait. ( sometimes they get busy)    First off head down for Happy hour, Monday & Wednesday is all day! What crazy right, well its so worth it. Tuesday&Thursday-Sunday is 12pm -6:30pm and 9pm-12:30am. During these times hit up the appetizers and sides for the best deal.    Now on the BBQ meat and seafood section just about the same great selection.  Hirami Miso and the Kalbi short rib are a must but don't be afraid to get the Angus beef rib. This might be the best kept secret on the menu! The mushrooms are a must the garlic mushroom is my favorite...    If this is your first time, start with one of the Value BBQ course for 2. These will give you a great sample of what they have to offer. Just choose what works best you and your party. The best part is after your meal the dessert is they pull off the grill and bring you S'mores.     Each time i come here and get great service and they bring out the food really fast, I mean you cook it yourself?  The side dishes are on point as well so be sure to try it all.
