Started 8/20/2011 (5 of 365)  I was pleasantly suprised by how flavorful and yummy everything we ordered was!  My friend and I came here over the weekend at around 3pm; so no one was in the restaurant.  We ordered: Pad See Ew Beef, Garlic Short Ribs, and Papaya Salad.  The salad was refreshing, the short ribs had a great crispy texture on it and wasn't too salty; just the right amount of garlic flavor, and the Pad See Ew was one of the best I've ever tasted!  It was full of flavor, had an abundance of egg which I love, and you get to choose whether you want american or Chinese broccoli.  Awesome!  The only downside was they didn't have any mango at the time we were there; and it's in season!  Not good.  I would have given it 5 stars if they had it!

The food is OK, and the portion is usually generous. However, I give the restaurant only two stars based on my last two experiences with them. One time I ordered some lunch specials to go including a beef Pad Thai. When I started to eat I immediately noticed the beef was spoiled and tasted disgusting. It's not just not fresh it's literally spoiled. So I threw the entire box away. The second time I placed the order online for pickup at about 7:45 pm. When I arrived the restaurant at 8:10 they appeared to forget about my order. I waited in the lobby and expected my order to be ready in 10 mins as the restaurant was only 1/3 full. However, I waited until almost 9 PM! They gave me a free Thai tea for my wait and I guess that's why I hesitate to give them a 1 star.", "Date": "2016-09-01", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jessica", "ReviewID": "8CvfMIvMG9tpK3F_6uWdaA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "This place is delicious!!

We were seated quick...the staff and Chef (see below) were great and attentive.  Ordered:  Yellow Curry Fettuccine Alfredo...I know! Fettuccine Alfredo in a Thai place?!? Thats what made me want to try it and it didnt disappoint. Though I had to order a side of steamed rice to help with the spice, cus no i didnt have an option of choosing a spice level. But, I would order it again.  Divine Scallops....4 scallops on the plate. God, they melted like butter in my mouth...but again. It was too spicy for my like. So I ate some rice with them. Lol it helps!   BBQ Chicken....it was about 3-4 pieces of chicken, comes with its own rice. What can I say? Its a classic. It was great.   For Dessert: We werent going to order any however the Chef happened to be taking a breather while we were having dinner and after a good 15-20 minute conversation about work and life, to our surprise he sent us some dessert, on the house! It was.....  Banana dipped in tempura and deep fried, on the plate came strawberry sauce and on the side a large scoop of fresh coconut ice cream.

First off, Panna Thai Restaurant looks a bit more upscale than your average Thai joint, which I think reflects in the price as well.  We walked in to a relatively empty restaurant on a weekday.  As the waiter brought us to our table, he immediately asked if we had any coupons (before we even sat down).  We did not, but apparently they do have a lot floating around and are a bit restrictive about how they are used.  I think they are also on restaurant.com too.  Lunch specials are available everyday from 11 am to 4 pm.  They all include a fried wonton, fresh salad, steamed rice, and soup of the day.  (You can substitute fried rice or brown rice for $1 more.)    Started off with miso soup.  Interesting choice.   I went for the Yellow Curry Lunch Special with Tofu  Thai yellow curry and Thai herbs served with Jasmine rice.  ($6.95).   Fried tofu and potatoes were the main components of my dish.  Raw bell peppers decorated the top.  I wished they cooked the veggies with the curry though.  The fried wonton had peas and carrots in it - a bit different than what you normally find inside one of those things.  The biggest problem I had was with the rice.  It was mushy - too much water in the cooker!  It's never a good sign when the rice gets messed up!   The Husband tried out their Garlic Short Ribs Lunch Special  Deep fried short ribs sauteed with garlic and black pepper sauce served with Jasmine rice.  ($6.95)  It was a tasty dish and lots of flavor, but then again it's deep fried and it sounds like it would be tasty.  Overall, we found Panna Thai to be just an okay experience.  There are definitely a few other Thai restaurants in the neighborhood that has a foot up on selection, taste, and price.", "Date": "2010-12-03", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Cookie", "ReviewID": "BC2PGobrwEu4zR3HWlYuQg", "Overall": "1", "Content": "This place has new owners and the food is now terrible.

I am a huge tea fan and I really could have knocked back 2 before my meal arrived. For my appetizer, I ordered the summer rolls and they were delicious. I absolutely love the taste of mint with the tangy peanut sauce. My main course consisted of the yellow curry with potatoes, coconut milk, and tofu. The curry had great flavor and even though I ordered it spicy, the peppers were not overbearing. If you are not really into spice, you can order no spice.   The only slight negative was our server appeared to be working a large amount of tables by herself, so she was rushing and some of the plates had a rough  landing  on our table.

This place does it well. Very much comparable to our favourite Thai place which is just a little further from home - Archi's on Rainbow.  The first time we came, I ordered the lunch special - both of us agreed that the soup that came with it was so tasty! I had the Pad Thai and he had the tofu Panang Curry. Both delicious!!

Since I had to round it, 4 star it is.  The three of us ordered one appetizer, one salad, and two entrees.  Satay Combo - two beef and two chicken skewers grilled to perfection!  I'd say that Panna Thai delivered the juiciest beef Satay in town!  Yum-wun-sen (the silver noodle salad) - there were only 4 shrimps in this salad and no any other seafood.  I'd say this is seasoned to appeal to the locals since it did taste kind of   americanized.   BBQ Spare Rib - Fork tender and falls right off the bone!  The sweet BBQ sauce wasn't just poured on, it was completely absorbed by the meat itself.  Sweety Duck -  I have to give this two thumbs up.  I'd say we eat duck pretty often since we visit the Cantonese restaurants in town all the time.  The Sweety Duck is up there with the tops, if not, even better!   The decor and atmosphere are WAY better than the Noodle House 2 that's only one block away.

The only reason I decided to eat here was because I received a special coupon from Restaurant.com -- it was not a coupon I purchased but a promotion Walgreens was running and I got a $25.00 gift certificate. During my lunch break, I met my boyfriend here and immediately saw an unprofessional sign which said they are no longer accepting the Restaurant.com coupon. I was instantly disappointed and I spoke to the waittress and said I had no idea it was no longer accepted and no where on the certificate does it say management may refuse to accept. Her manager cut in and told me she was no longer accepting the coupon. I said I didn't realize that but is there anything you can honor? She replied in a snooty attitude that she can't accept the coupon and it is not her fault and I can receive my money back from Restaurant.com. I told her I didn't purchase the coupon and so there's no money to be redeemed except for at this restaurant. I asked for her manager and she said the owner was not working today and I asked for his card so I can email him and she said she wasn't allowed to give out his contact information. I asked when he would be in so I can ask him about the coupon and she said he doesn't come in everyday and she has no idea when he'll be here. Throughout the whole time she was be very rude and pointing in my face and I told her that because of her lack of resourcefulness and inability to be polite, I could not eat here so she right away told me she can give me a coupon for $15 and I decided to take it and order some food.

Ok, I gave it 4 tries. This time it really did it.   I would give three stars for food. Here is why: I don't think it's anything great, but it's not too bad either. Although yesterday my husband refused to finish any of the dishes and my 3 year old is literally throwing up as I write this. Last night he had fried rice and soup (she hadn't eaten anything else for dinner - very slim chance of a coincidence).  All four times I've been there, it takes 40 minutes to an hour + to get done. And we are usually  fast  eaters. We sit down, we know what we want, we eat, and we're out. We go out every day and don't have time to sit around and talk like some people do.  Ok, I can understand that also, but when it takes 10 minutes between asking for a check and actually getting one there is something wrong here. My husband had already left by then as my 3 year old had enough of sitting there that long. Good thing I paid with cash or I wouldn't be able to wait for another 10 minutes for them to run a card.

Not sure if they hired new folks but they were just rude.  My family and I a total of 6 of us with two little ones went in and the service was super poor.  There was only 2 other people in the restaurant.   When we went to order we just asked to have a chicken breast for my daughter and they said no whole meal...they were so focused on serviing whole plates they couldn't accomadate.  I even told them to charge us the full price but just a chicken breast is what I needed but they said no that they couldn't do it.  We asked for a side of broccoli and carrots and they said no.  It was ridiculous.  At that point I didn't care if they charged me $20 bucks for broccoli that is what we needed but they couldn't do it.  Finally my husband went to talk to the gentleman behind the counter and asked for the manager and he was very rude and said no manager here and there was nothing he could do.  My husband said we would leave so we all got up and went next door to the sushi place where they always treat us great.    The gentleman tried to make excuses saying it wasn't his fault and he didn't serve us and he was busy with the two other people in the restaurant.  They still charged us for food they never brought us and we were so frustrated that we gave them the money and left.

It seems as though most of the  casual  eaters rate the food at these establishments pretty high, while those with a tongue for Thai are a little more honest.  I'd like to think of myself as the latter.  My friends and I were greeted warmly and seated promptly as soon as we entered Panna Thai.  The earth-toned interior was decorated nicely with Thai accents as jazz music filled our ears and provided a relaxing atmosphere for good conversation.  Arriving about an hour before closing time, all servers still did their best to be friendly and attentive.    We shared Tom Yum Soup, choosing to go with the highest spicy level.  The large size was perfect for three or four people to share.  Medium level spicy had just the right amount of bite without being too overwhelming, and we were already sweating after a few minutes -- the mark of good tom yum.  Sinuses were cleared in no time.  It didn't matter that we never got the extra napkins we requested; we were too busy enjoying the great flavor and awesome start to the meal.  Next came the Spicy Crab Noodle and Spicy Fish Cha Cha.  I usually like to try the spicy fish dishes in every Thai restaurant I visit, so the Spicy Fish Cha Cha was a logical choice.  Choosing  spicy  on the mild-medium-spicy scale for both dishes did not disappoint, as the extra kick only enhanced the tremendous flavor.  The portions were fairly generous, and the remaining fish survived our appetites and made it to the take-home box .  The noodles were not so lucky.  Any time I end up overeating to the point of near-food coma, the food is just that damn good.

Beef Salad was the best item in my order.  As another reviewer mentioned, the beef was nicely smokey, and it was okay quality meat, not gristly.  The salad is mostly meat, with light lettuce and some tomatoes and cucumbers.  The dressing is mostly lime juice, which I like.  A good low calorie fairly-healthy choice.  I would have liked cucumber slices that were a bit larger.  Chicken Fried Rice was kind of weird, there were clumps that were really sweet (maybe it was sweetened eggs?), but mostly it was really bizarrely bland.  Tons of onions.  Not much chicken or tomatoes.  I would not get this again, myself.  Green Milk Boba was overpriced, the cup was small styrofoam (12-16oz if there wasn't any ice), 50% ice at least, and barely any boba ($1 upcharge).  The boba were super overcooked to the point they had melted down small.  For $4.50 I could have a monster-size boba somewhere else.

My boyfriend likes this dish, but I am not fan of red/green peppers, so I just sneak a bite or two of just the meat. Pad Thai = Sweeter than other places, but always tasty. Pineapple Fried Rice = Comes with both Shrimp and Chicken which I like. I often ask for it to have a bit extra spice, but I think I like it better original.

To start with, we both had Thai iced teas that were fantastic and refilled before they were halfway empty. We shared a bowl of Tom Kha Gha, which was the best I've ever had.  For entrees, we had the Red Curry with Chicken and Sweety Duck, both of which were fantastic.  The duck was moist with a nice crispy skin and honey glaze, served with steamed broccoli.  The curry had a generous amount of meat and the veggies were fresh and not overcooked.    Dessert was the house specialty: Mango with Sticky Rice.  Excellent, though it's seasonal, subject to ripe mangos, so take advantage in the springtime! Homemade Coconut Ice Cream is also on the menu, though we didn't get to try it because we were stuffed.  As mentioned in other reviews, the portion size is generous.  Neither my wife nor I were able to finish our entrees and it was packed up with extra rice to take home.

It was a rainy week this week in Vegas and after cooking something at home and it not turning out just right I called Panna.   I ordered the crab wontons and pork pad see ew. I have been on a pork kick lately so that was the reason instead of going traditional with the beef. I was really eager to try the crab wontons as I saw that it was made with real crab. Sure enough it was as delish as other Yelpers had said it was and I even told my husband he HAD to try it. The consensus in our household was that it was pretty great. The pork pad see ew was good but I'm a carbs person. The pork to noodle ratio was about 2:1 so I felt like I was eating a lot of meat. Overall the flavor was good I just didn't like the overbearing meat but if you are a meat eater than this is definitely for you. I have to say I felt like I did get my money's worth in regards to both items.   The next day I wanted to try the BBQ pork noodles. It's BBQ pork noodle soup and I really really really enjoyed the pork. It was tender and there was plenty (which in this case I appreciated). Yes, I know I'm picky but I felt that the pork to egg noodle ratio was just perfect. I also ordered the spicy basil pork. Now that dish was just ok...definitely not my favorite place to order it from as I missed the cucumbers that do come with it at other Thai places. Overall, I def enjoyed this place. They do get busy though because the second night even though we ordered it at 7:30 pm it still was a 20-30 minute pick up time.

Unfortunately, last time that we ate here, my girlfriend paid for the bill with her credit card and left a generous cash tip. The staff then decided to take an additional tip from her credit card. This is straight-up theft. Unauthorized charges on an individual's credit card is a crime. Furthermore, it shows that the staff is not communicating.

Papaya salad - spice level 4 but papaya was really soggy with the sauce and wasn't sliced the authentic way, which really changes the texture.  Vietnamese egg rolls - the neon orange sauce was way too sweet, no spice at all. Not home made  Sticky rice - even though it's only a $2 item it's what I look forward to almost the most.

The curry was delicious. I ordered a mild but it came with a kick. Not sure if they got it wrong, or my tolerance is very low. It was creamy and very coconutty. The chicken was also nice and tender. I didn't really care for the dumplings. They were good, but they had an off taste that I couldn't quite figure out. The dipping sauce that came with the dumplings was a bit too strong in flavor. The tasty ginger with shrimp was my favorite. It had just the right amount of ginger and spices and the shrimp (peeled) was perfectly cooked. Their Thai tea is also very good (pretty generous with the cream, which I like).  If you're ordering through Yelp Eat24, the entrees come with rice. The menu doesn't state that.
