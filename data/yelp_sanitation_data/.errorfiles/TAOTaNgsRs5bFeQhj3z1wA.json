They have a guy outside advertising $5 pizza (14 ). When you go in and buy one the guy at the register punches $5 then guesstimates the tax (puts $5.50 total, should be $5.40) then you check your credit card statement and you get charged $6. I'm guessing if they do that with just one item they do it all the time, watch out for these crooks.   Pizza is not that great... I rather get a yummy one @ Jesse's Pizza or something.

Again beware, seems to me as thou they charge what ever the hell they want to charge, & if your not keying in the items correctly in the cash register, tells me your scamming your customers & taxes, business, ect. Something, some how it appears!

I mean just look at my profile and you'll see. But I do feel inclined to share my dining experience this time.   *sigh* where do I start ? Oh yes, from the bathroom , were I've been vomiting for the last 10-15 minutes. That's the wings fault. Listen I knew these non chain pizzerias definitely pull their frozen wings out of a bag, but jeezus christ. Were they from last year?? I mean you couldn't bite through the SKIN! Way to oily , greasy, I literally feel sick again just talking about them. No human being should be subject to what I have just eaten, Christ help your esophagus.   Now; the pizza. Your a pizzeria. Dude you had one job.ONE job !! How can you serve people that thing, and accept money for it?! Don't you feel bad? Showed up cold,undercooked, and the fkn cheese was it's own plastic layer completely seperate from the bread! Will post picture to explain. You can't serve this kind of product !!!!! It literally was the worst thing I HAVE EVER! Eaten. I'm ashamed and embarrassed , I only hope these people read these reviews and up they're quality because we don't need another place serving garbage in this neighborhood.

I only order a handful of things.  Manhattan Calzone (VERY HUGE!) 10  meat express Gyro Hot wings  This is the only pizza place I like bc it has flavor. Every topping contributes to every flavorful bite. Something I can't get in a commercial chain. The only thing is THEY SAY ground beef is apart of the ingredients but they never put it in there. (I'm glad), so I usually say,  No ground beef, add tomatoes . Well.....he charges me extra for that. Beef cost waaaay more than a few chopped tomatoes! Also, if you pay attention,  they kinda make up their own prices on that register. I've saved my receipts, ordered the same thing and they always differ by atleast 50cents. I still like their food. Plus the cook always checks me out. That's usually when my bill is less.

I've worked in a little pizza place similar to this one... (Food was a little bit tastier, but that's not the reason for the one star rating.) I mentioned working at a pizza place because I know how people can be and how much it sucks to make a mistake. But Im also aware as to how easy it is to just smile and be nice to people regardless if a mistake was made or if they were rude or kind.... Well, there is this older guy that works the register, and he has the worst attitude- any other time I've put my order in it's been two large pizzas one cheese one pepperoni, two 2liters and two ranches for roughly $12/$13... And regardless if the order is right and the transaction goes smooth- this guy still has the worst attitude. Well tonight I walk up to the shop to get my order and it's $1 cheaper than usual, and I also get only one pizza handed to me.... So I told him that my roommate had ordered two pizzas... He tells me no he only ordered the one. I then apologize to him and suggest that maybe it was a misunderstanding and to give me a moment to make sure- I called my roommate, he assures me two pizzas were ordered, as per usual. I tell the man yes sir two pizzas were ordered; one cheese and one pepperoni- he then tells me again, no just one pizza was ordered and that the guy ordered,  a pizza with cheese and pepperoni ..... Now usually most pizzas come with cheese as a given, or if I wasn't sure I would have kindly asked the customer to repeat what they had said - (where I worked we read back the order at the end of the call anyway, just to make sure it was what they ordered)... He maintains that one pizza was ordered... I asked him if I could please just have the other pizza..... So while telling me that most people that order from them  they ask for a pizza with cheese and pepperoni  he then tells me it's going to be a 7 minute wait, which I'm fine with because fresh food is the best, but then he charges me -on top of the original $11.50- another $5.50 for the  extra pizza ...... I ended up apologizing for the misunderstanding- he made no apologies or attempt to make it better...  Now I'm not sure if there is a mistake fee the customer has to pay or we just got charged extra for the extra awesome attitude- but this sucks and I wish I would have caught it before I walked home and my roommate pointed it out to me. I know the difference is only a couple bucks, but it makes a difference when you're trying to watch your money... The attitude was just the icing on the cake I guess... $17 for mediocre food and extra wait time.... I don't understand?", "Date": "2014-06-10", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
