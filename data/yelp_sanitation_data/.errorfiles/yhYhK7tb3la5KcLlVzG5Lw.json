THE SETUP  Honestly, who wants to spend $50 on cover (for guys) to dance?  But I put it into perspective:  I may be with a group of friends who are taking this moment of a couple of hours to play craps or Black Jack.  Most of them lose considerably more than a couple hundred dollars in THAT endeavor.  I at least get to dance to some jamming tunes and even meet some really nice people & socialize the rest of the night.  So you do the math....  DJ EXTRAORDINAIRE  It's been fun in the past because my buddy DJ Ernan (originally from Sacramento, and where I'm based now) has done gigs here and when lucky enough to align my schedule with his, he has gotten me guestlist privileges, so that's a plus as well.  PHYSICAL PLANT  It's a beautiful dance floor and a nice physical layout of bar-to-dance-floor ratios.  It kind of reminds of the old Barcode club we had in Sacramento before it was demolished (*sigh*).  THE LOWDOWN  LAX Nightclub is a decent - albeit not my favorite - dance stop in Vegas.  If I can make the cost and timing work for me, then there's a chance I will enjoy myself without breaking the bank.  ;)", "Date": "2013-08-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "John", "ReviewID": "Z-lqsyhGb49YhykIvwAN5w", "Overall": "3", "Content": "As much as I want to love LAX, as it is my usual nightclub of choice, I have a hard time bumping it up higher than 3 stars. Then again its hard to bump any nightclub in Vegas up higher than 3 stars when you can barely move or dance in any of them unless you are in the VIP areas. I have been to LAX a number of times since it opened, including the night it opened because it was on my birthday. Maybe that is why I still go? I feel I been with them from the start? Or it could just be because I know a doorman and a VIP Host and I don't have to wait in any lines when I go. However, I am not a fan of Pure Management as I feel they have some of the worst door guys and managers. These guys just happen to be an exception. I used to know a few security guards there but most have moved on. It was always nice to go and see familiar faces, but now they are just mean faces. The dance floor at LAX was small on opening night but gradually got smaller as time went on. Its really hard to dance when you can't move. It's more like swaying back and forth and side to side than dancing. They gave more and more room to the VIP areas and then cram everyone else in. Constantly bumping into other people and having drinks spilled on you. Drinks are outrageously expensive and I don't like the fact that if I want to go dance I have to be worried that my drink will get knocked out of my hand. That's a quick $12 on the ground. Positives: -Love the decor and atmosphere of this place. The colors and lighting are great and the furniture in VIP is really nice as well. They have 3 bars that while they can sometimes be tough to get to, they are actually easier than some other places. -NOIR BAR: a smaller, exclusive lounge tucked away inside LAX with elevator access guarded by security or a back door entrance on the Mandalay Place valet side of Luxor. A must see if you can get in. I prefer to hang out here if LAX is too crazy. -The DJ's at LAX are usually really good. No complaints there for the most part. -Special performances: They have live music performances every once in a while here and they are really fun. Saw N*E*R*D here and it was incredible. Crowd surfing and moshing at a nightclub was insane. -Beautiful cocktail servers: always a plus.

We got on their VIP list through a local promoter that we typically use with hopes that we would be able to get in for free easily. Although the VIP line seemed to be longer than the general admission line, we got in pretty quickly.  What bugged me about the line was that the door woman at the end of the line was unhelpful and rude.  She gave me an attitude when I asked her the simple question of which line to go in.  I felt like I was bothering her, and I immediately could understand why this place is so poorly rated on Yelp.  Once we got inside, I was surprised to see how packed it was for a Wednesday night.  It has a really strange setup with a bar on each side and the packed dance floor in between.  The music selection was not the greatest, and the sound system was okay.  The club just seemed very outdated and due for a renovation and upgrade.  The most appealing thing about LAX was that through the promoter that we used to get in ladies got free vodka drinks until 12AM.  I was here with my wife and a female friend, and they were able to repeatedly go back to the bar and get drinks without a hassle.  It made the experience at LAX that much better that we didn't have to spend hoards of money on drinks, and it is the main reason I bumped up my review of LAX to three stars.  LAX wouldn't be my first choice of a nightclub to check out when in Las Vegas, but it was an okay experience.  Free drinks definitely lured us in, but I wish they had more to keep us coming back.

It's hard for me to give a Las Vegas club under 3 stars.  All the clubs in Vegas are so extravagant and over the top with such great music, that even if I didn't like it that much it still deserves at least 3 stars for the effort and millions of dollars spent designing it.    When we came here, we didn't have to deal with any line sitch because my best friend's boyfriend is a chef at American Company Bistro next door, so we were escorted right in, thankfully.  The line was extremely long, and probably would have been a nightmare...not that dealing with lines in Vegas is my forte anyhow.  Anyways, into the club and down the red carpet staircase we went.  The interior is deep red, with luscious chandeliers and numerous side rooms.  It was smaller than I expected- you can see the entirety of the club as soon as you walk in the door.    I will say this: don't bother coming here if you're not going to get a table.  Its very similar to Pure in the sense that if you don't have a place to sit, you're shuffled around and around in circles like a herd of cattle.  Pure Management Group has developed a trend when designing their clubs.  But, with a table it is pretty awesome.  The couches are comfortable, and the table spaces are ample.  But, it still doesnt have shit on Tryst or BodyEnglish...my two faves.  It takes a lot to outdo a 100ft waterfall over the dance floor.  Ps.

Oddly enough we had almost no wait in line - maybe about ten minutes max.  Our names were supposedly on the VIP list but the bouncer looked us up and down and without even glancing at his clipboard, let us through.  Thank god we didn't pay cover because as others here have pointed out, VIP really isn't VIP, it just means you get into the club first or a little earlier than everyone else.  Once you get out of line and into the eye-watering neo-Gothic club (wtf they expect drunk people to not biff it in those dark hallways and going down those crazy stairs?), you realize that your VIP status didn't do much for you.  At that point the club wasn't terribly packed (oh, just you wait an hour) so we made our way with ease to the bar, where a snotty looking lady/bartender provided us with our $34 vodka Red Bulls.  Already feeling let down by the lackluster  VIP  and the even-stiff-for-Vegas drink prices, we decided to give one last ditch effort: do several shots of tequila and hit the dance floor.  This time we had a good looking guy serve our drinks, and for four shots of Patron we (shockingly) paid only $24.  Hmmm...  Well-fortified with booze, we forced our way onto the dance floor which was now packed. But, no two-stepping for these gals. A nice mix of 80's music was playing - our specialty - and we made it very clear that if you stepped within our four-foot radius you risked hair in the mouth or fist in the eye.  Long story short, we were invited to join a bachelor party over the red ropes...  This was the beginning of what I like to call Vegas: The Worst Hangover of my Life. (No, really.  We even went to the airport seven hours early so I could get my ass on a plane back to SeaTac so I could continue my vomiting in my OWN bathroom.)

It's one of the newest clubs in Vegas  but I don't think it's one of the best.   Good points: - Music was always changing and was pretty good and consistent - Alki is normal. Not overly priced or cheap. Average size and price for Vegas - Good fun crowd. Everyone just wanted to be seen and have fun.  - Lots of VIP sections/rooms  Bad points: - Took us 1.5 hours to get inside!!!! The lines weren't even lines! Everyone just stood anywhere and waved money at the bouncer to get them inside. Ridiculous! At least have proper lines people! - As I can recall, there was just 1 big dance floor and tons of VIP sections and small rooms.I guess if you don't have VIP you won't be sitting down all night or have space to dance.    Overall, I think this place is very overrated! I rather party it up at Tao or Pure. More rooms with each of their own music, more places to walk around, and nicer scenery and environment. The lines may be long at Tao and Pure but at least it's more organized!  And as for VIP, for some odd reason they stamped me with VIP and I have no idea how or why I got it. I just followed my friends and they walked right into a VIP room and got stamped. Soon, the whole room was crowded with people. So how strict are they with this VIP rooms? I'm not sure!

The LAX is completely indoor so there is no outdoor seating or any free seating for that matter. The lighting is actually really bad, it's ridiculously dark so you can hardly make out any faces. Good luck  finding  a good looking person to dance with, might have to be doing some guess-n-checks.   The dance floor itself was really big and nice, I also loved how the DJ was seated high above everyone so you could easily see them. The staff was super friendly and nice and was always helpful and would answer my endless questions always with a smile! :)  There is also guess what... COAT CHECK...whaaat. I've been to a lot of clubs and this is the first one with a proper coat check, oh maaan! That was nice. All clubs need this, it's so convenient especially in the Winter.   I had a vodka and cranberry with the house vodka which did not settle well so I don't recommend their house liquors, I thought a high end club would have high end house drinks but owell. Live and learn.   The bathroom was very clean and beautiful. I loved the strong lighting and long mirrors so I could fix myself and it was even bright enough to fix my makeup.  The decor was gorgeous. Mainly dark, romantic, and gothic - the large curtains, the black railings, and red couches were all very stunning.   The DJ definitely did very well, he mixed smoothly and played some old school hip hop as well as modern. Nice mixing all around.   The crowd was definitely in their early twenties to late thirties, not a lot of people younger.

At one point I attempted to relieve my aching feet by taking my shoes off in the corner while I finished a drink, but was then asked by another security guard to put them back on (the girls on stage had no shoes!)  No sympathy from that guy though.  This could all be anticipated, but wouldn't have rubbed me such the wrong way if the club had been 1) bigger, and 2) cooler, better decorated, or more unique.

My gf and I were in Vegas last weekend for a fun girls trip. We decided to go to LAX on Saturday night because the hotel gave us passes to get in free before midnight. We got there about 10:30pm, got in free and got free vodka drinks until midnight. It wasn't nasty well vodka either, it was Skyy vodka. So that was a pretty good deal. The dance floor was small and awkward, like a hallway between all the VIP booths. I feel like if more people can fit into the VIP area than the  regular people  area, that's not very VIP. The music was pretty 90's but good 90's so whatever. So my friend and I are dancing and having a good time when out of nowhere a bouncer pulls me out and asks for my ID. The only thing I could think was that maybe he didn't think I was 21? So he keeps my ID and tells me to follow him and then I thought maybe he thinks my ID is fake? Luckily my friend followed me and then suddenly were out in the front of the club and I realized they were kicking me out! The bouncer said I was being kicked out for  swaying  too much. Now, I know I'm a white girl, but I was trying to dance, and apparently  swaying  is inappropriate dancing? I started laughing and joking with my friend about how dumb they were being and how I was clearly not too drunk to be in their precious club. (And I know this because I remember everything that happened. If I were too drunk, I feel there'd be fuzzy details.) There were also 2 cops standing right there laughing along with me so obviously they didn't think my level of inebriation was something to be concerned about. They gave me back my ID and we walked back to our room, making sure to tell everyone we met along the way that this club sucks.   In conclusion, I would never go back here. BUT if you're a girl you get in free and get free Skyy vodka drinks before midnight so that's pretty cool. Just make sure you don't  sway  on the dancefloor!!

I highly suggest staying at the Luxor hotel if you plan on hitting this club up, especially if there is a special event going on.

As far as the club goes, the dance floor is really small and you have to fight for a spot.  Once you have enough drinks in you, this will of little significance, especially if you have other friends making room for you to dance.  It was really easy to buy a drink and the bars were not that crowded at all.  I had a really great time but it was mostly because of the intoxicated state.

Granted, I was in Las Vegas for a little over the weekend, with all the things I crammed into those 4 days; the most memorable was definitely the memories I gathered in this club. Granted, this club was the first club I ever went to and I got in for free with a  girl bracelet  so that was definitely a giant bonus for me. On top of this, free drinks!?   I ended up with a booth and bottle service. To be honest, I was really skeptical at first because it was really intimidating at first; the red lights, the rope that separated the VIP section from the dance floor and the bouncers. At the side of the booths, the workers were super friendly, really catered to their customers and inviting.  After drinks were brought to me, I found myself at the awkward level where I didn't really know what to do. But as soon as the music started playing, things were going on really well. This is really the haven for 90s babies, the in-house DJ mixes the music really well and the nostalgia flows directly into you.  The booths are super comfy, workers are super friendly and cleanliness is at the top of their list. The moment a drink is spilled, a guy comes sashaying by to clean it up. The bathroom here is super clean, as well. On top of that, while it's super dark, the bouncers and such are so kind they use the flashlights to shine the way for you without taking away from the ambience of the club. It's super loud but not because of the people, it's really the music -it flows through the entire club collectively. People do not leave the dance floor because this club is that amazing.

I was there for a bachelor party and staying at the Luxor, and with 1/2 our party passed out and lacking proper dress shoes, the other half of us came to LAX to check out the scene a bit past midnight on last Saturday night.  There wasn't much of a line, and the bouncer was surprisingly nice.  We were waiting at the entrance and they bouncer tried to charge us $50/head to get in.  I told him, look, I was at Surrender last night which is a much better club (with a well-known DJ) and we paid around $40 each for that.  The bouncer immediately brought down the price to $25/each, which wasn't too bad considering I'd done well in the casino that day.  I could hear loud hip-hop and top 40 coming from the club and asked who the DJ was. He was like  Tiesto or someone, I dunno.   Yea, that's not Tiesto, my friend.  Anyways.  Behind us in the line was a separate queue for some people in some kind of Club Crawl (if you are in a club crawl or package that takes you here ... just don't go.)  They looked miserable and the  tour guide  was going apeshit on the bouncer that we somehow got in before her group of 40+ wasted people.  We get inside and it's more top 40 and hiphop.  The DJ wasn't even mixing, just switching from song to song with a fade in between.  However, the dancefloor was still packed ... with sketchy drunk dudes.  I'm not one to judge, but Surrender was about about 60/40 girls/guys - most guys respectful in dress shirts and jackets, girls were hot as hell and there to party.  This place was at least 80% gross dudes and the girls that were there - they were disgusting too.  It was also hotter than hell in there.  And the $13 drinks there were a travesty - very little alcohol, for they extra dollar at the better clubs they make you a stiff drink.  Made a couple rounds around the club and left laughing at the club, and had a better time at the bar across the way drinking with the Bret Michaels impersonator using our free drink coupons.  Really, there's no reason to come here unless it's too late to go anywhere else - even then, better to call it a night or hit one of the casino bars than to come here.

Pros - VIP service is great our friend had it and was nice enough to not have us chip in for bottle service. We walked right in the club not having to wait,  the security guards are nice. A group of girls can actually get in without having to wait, A group of guys can actually get in without slipping money or VIP, but you would have to wait in a long line (probably two hour wait). The club looks nicer and an improvement from RA. They added another level. If you have VIP passes, you still have to wait in line, you just pay half off the cover.  Cons - the music is absolutely terrible. I am one for hearing good music, but  i think i heard the same song every hour.  They played journey about four times (uuhh )They need to have good variety. The dancefloor is so small and it is also a walkway to the otherside of the bar. Plus, it was crowded. The club is really stuffy and I walked out of there smelling like cigarettes and cigars. There is only one main room (unless you have VIP)  My advice is that make sure you go when there is a good dj, otherwise the music just plain sucks. If you get VIP request the table at a designated area (close the dancefloor, balcony, or private room) or else you will get a table in a sucky area where you feel claustrophobic because the ceiling is so close to your head. From talking to other people who had bottle service, it is really expensive compared to other vegas clubs.

Blame the girl that I was holding up who couldn't even walk or stand straight!  The  celebrities  of the evening were Nick La Gay and Vanessa  Hoochie  Manillo. It was a Saturday night... you would think that better celebs would be there?!?! I ran into Paris Hilton at PURE on a SUNDAY NIGHT!  And I spent $50 on 5 bottles of water. Not including tip.

You go around the Volcano and immediately go down a sweeping staircase right into the dance floor. Ummm couldn't we have cut the stairs out all together and just made a walk way right into the club? Poor planning.  If they had inverted the club's dance floor, it would be like Vanity, which has a great layout. No, instead, the put the dancefloor right where the entrance is, so the dancefloor is packed with people snaking through to get to the bar or other side of the room. Stupid. A dance floor should be used for dancing, not as a highway to get to the rest of the areas in the club.  The place was so incredibly packed with gross-os that it was difficult to move. Some guy, while we were walking through, came up from behind and kissed Jen on the cheek. She never even saw him. Weird.

I called the night before and left a message on machine that picked up that I was going to be in town and would love to get on the guest list, plus one if I could.  When I hung up, I thought I would NEVER hear back from them, but the next day, I got a text from someone that gave me instructions on when to show up and what to do when I got there.  It was really easy and we got right in.  This guy was amazing!  I won't name him by name because I'm not sure if he would want me to or not, but he was so incredibly helpful.  He texted me to make sure I was in.  He set it up so that I could go back to a lounge.  He texted to make sure I was having a good time.  I mean- this guys was GREAT!    Every staff member and bouncer was super friendly and helpful and trying to make sure my wife and I had a great time.  The reviews I read about these guys are weird when I think back, because I had such a different experience.  There wasn't too many people there at first, so we went up to the bar to get some drinks.  I was drinking wine and it was about $12 every time I got a glass of house Cabernet. Bar tenders were great.     Eventually the place filled up and we moved out to the dance floor.  The music was perfect (Which is totally a matter of taste). But it was hip hop, top 40, popular stuff from off the radio.  Justin Timberlake, Taylor Swift, Some Rap, some hip hop... a little Michael Jackson sprinkled in.    There were all kinds of beautiful people in there- especially my wife  :)  She looked hot that night :)  Anyway- we had a great time.    The next day, I asked a bar tender in the bar right outside LAX why she thought LAX got such a bad rap from reviews and she said that it might have been reviews from before a recent remodel.  Also, I suppose it probably has to do with the number of people there.  Every place can be not fun if there are more people than the place can hold.     So, I say- go check it out!

Vegas on Labor Day Weekend, that is.  And after some serious crowd maneuvering, my BFFs and I headed into opening night at the LAX  nightclub in Luxor, hosted by none other than, OMG, Miss Britney Spears.  And with hot DJ AM (one of the club's celebrity investors) spinning, it was bound to be a good party.  Besides the fact that the club was too crowded too breathe, it has definitely made its way onto my list of favorite nighttime spots in Vegas.  The ambiance is truly impressive.  The decor is simple and untainted (like Britney's love for her kids).  Dark crimson curtains and mini spotlights set the stage, with beautiful chandeliers throughout the space, made of dark metal and bright candlelights.  Decorative metal balcony rails across the parameter of the club add richness to the interior.  With over 26,000 ft. of space, there are several reservable tables and hidden VIP spots across the club, including impressively placed balcony seating areas on the upper level that oversee the rest of the club, main dance floor and stage.  Multiple bars (with friendly bartenders) are fairly accessible, especially given the size of the crowd.  Drinks were $11-$14 each, which though expensive, is on par with prices at most hot Vegas venues.  Hats off to Pure Management Group on the grand opening.

Our bouncer was nice, security is really really high at this place. getting around is extremely hard.   second time to LAX: it was our last night in vegas so we wanted to go party. another club Rain or Pure one of the two had a corporate party going on full of suit and ties, so we opted for LAX since a promoter was  hooking  us up. we had about 20 people so we got the upstairs vip area, right next to the bathroom. we ordered 3 bottles and some beer and extra stuff. it came to be a little of $3!! this was fine considering it was 20 people ($150 per person). we got 1-2 waitresses mixing our drinks, cleaning, etc. but most of the time, we found ourselves mixing the drinks ourselves after the 3rd-4th rounds. i would pay that price again to avoid the crowd this place has. its totally packed!!! it takes you forever to get to the bar, and from the dance floor to the bathroom would take you another 10 minutes! our security, again, was top notched! the DJ was really good, some of the best i've heard.   decor is pretty decent, bathrooms are spacious (for guys). but i think the layout is what makes the club small. they have 2 staircases-one on each side. and bouncers will PHYSICALLY move you if you are blocking the stairs or standing on them.  the VIP areas surround the small dance floor.   overall, both nights were VIP, so we had no trouble walking right to the front of the line...it makes you feel  special  and the others look at you and think,  who are these people  lol... the lines are deep!!! over 100 people deep!", "Date": "2009-05-07", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "T.", "ReviewID": "90pkG5oCMQxeH8PUwn4B2w", "Overall": "2", "Content": "3 stars for the layout.  0 stars for the music.  1 star for no cover being a Luxor guest.  -2 stars for no Britney or Paris cameos (-1 each).", "Date": "2009-12-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "K", "ReviewID": "0Om85CUjS-5d3l4yG6Rupg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "One of the nicest staffs of any club in Vegas.

So I gave this place two stars for those who want to feel special and get a table.  You can stop reading this review and go to this place if that's what you're looking for.  If you want to dance, here's the 411.  We stayed at the Mandalay Bay and were looking for a Hip Hop club.  There wasn't one there so we heard Luxor had one.  The music sounded good from the outside so I didn't mind paying $50 for me and $30 for the wife to get in.  But once we got in I realized I made a mistake.  I guess it's because I'm a Californian but I would like to think I know what a good club is and this isn't one.  The main floor is roped off to give those who pay for a table 10 extra feet of room while leaving the cheapies (like me) with no room to dance.  This left a very narrow path down the middle of the club which is meant to serve as the minuscule dance floor and walkway.  The layout could be more conducive to dancing but since this club wants to focus on bottle service don't bother coming here if you just want to dance.  And the music: what I thought was good hip hop on the outside turned out to be poorly mixed music.  The DJ kept having a lull from one song to the next leaving an awkward pause between tracks.  This caused the crowd to stand around in between songs because he couldn't mix the music correctly.  Anyways... If you want to pay extra money to make yourself feel special then come here.

We decided to check out LAX since we heard decent reviews about the place.  We went on a Saturday night and it was packed....not sure if it made a difference that there had been a boxing match that night at the Luxor.    We were placed on the guest list courtesy of a friend but as a group of ladies, I'm sure we could have gotten in either way.  The only problem with trying to get in off the guest list is that there is no organized line so you have to push your way to the front to find a promoter who will let you in.  We were able to get in after doing this for about 15 minutes.  Normal cover is $40...these are the times it pays to be a woman! :)  The venue is decent size with a smaller rectangular dance floor.  I would recommend table service since the club is set up for that with tables all around the dance floor and also on the balconies surrounding the dance floor.  One compliant is that there is no designated walkway through the club so to get to the other side you basically have to walk through the already crowded dance floor.  The music was great - DJ Hollywood was playing that night with a great mix of top 40's with some oldies mixed in.  The crowd seemed older - early 30's with a 2.5 to 1 ratio for men to women.  As usual there were random men hitting on my friends and I but isn't that typical for a Vegas club? ;)  All in all a decent place (much bigger than the LAX in LA) with good music but a somewhat smaller dance floor.", "Date": "2008-04-15", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ariel", "ReviewID": "H2Y7VUqdSxXlnP5DNhzAMA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "-1 because it's not very flashy or Vegas- like at all. kinda dingy-er then your usual popular Vegas club.   heard from a Friend this place was really good and it was a wed. night so we figured lets give it a try.   right away- not even up to the door yet a handsome door guy walks up to us asks how many we have with us [ group of 4 girls] and literally walks up up to the club, past the door, through the crowd, up the stairs into the VIP area- gets us all a drink made pronto by the waitress introduced us to some people and then came back like every 15 min to make sure we were all good and having a blast. Damn that's what i call service!  The people we met we actually ended up knowing through 6 degrees of separation so it was fun but i can see how a lot of people would be thrown off by being offered to VIP guests as a hot slab of meat but just because your being offered doesn't mean you have to do anything about it except enjoy their bottles for free. ha ha   I LOVE LOVE LOVE the fact that the VIP is off the floor and raised up [ about 4-7 steps?] and that it is separated into 2 sides with the DJ booth in the middle.

I get that they want to push bottle service- but when they can't fill up those areas it makes NO sense to have them still roped off plus an extra 10ft all around as well- there was literally more roped off empty space than there was space for regular patrons to walk and dance.

I'm not in agreement, but I can see the point of view of some of these people, and I think what it comes down to is what you're looking for when you go clubbing in Vegas.  Now in fairness, LAX is not as 'pretty' as other places, like 'Surrender' or 'Pure.' It isn't going to win any points for ambiance, for sure. It's an older club and an older hotel and it looks it. So, those looking for 'fancy' won't find it here. Personally though, the key for me when it comes to clubbing is good music, a decent crowd, and enough room to dance.  Like most Vegas clubs, my girls and I got in free, which was nice.   The crowd is relaxed and casual. Most of the time when I go out in Vegas I'm in a dress and heels. Here I wore jeans and didn't feel underdressed by any means. It's not the kind of place where you need that 'Vegas' dress. Some on here have said the people at LAX are 'ghetto' and I suppose in comparison with XS and more upscale clubs, LAX could be, by comparison, considered 'ghetto' - but I'm guessing it's people who've never been anywhere NEAR the ghetto who are labeling this place as that. I've been to truly GHETTO clubs in my life and this place wasn't really ghetto. The crowd was fine. Didn't see any guys I wanted to dance with, but that's not a necessity for me to have a good time in a club.  What IS a necessity for me in a club is good music and this place DELIVERED. I went with my friends, all of whom grew up through the late-80s to late-90s and we were LOVING the music!! Getting all nostalgic, dancing to songs I haven't heard in a while, yet we ALL still knew ALL the lyrics. I can imagine the 20-year-olds in the club that night were probably hating on all the 'old' stuff the DJ was playing, but the 30-year-olds in there were definitely feeling it. Music I can dance to? Love it. Also a plus is that this place wasn't jam-packed. I actually had room to dance!! Most of the  popular  places on the Strip are so full you can hardly move an inch.  All-in-all: It may not be anything fancy or ultra-special, but when with my friends, our most enjoyable night out in a club was at LAX.

We rented a suite in the West Tower at The Luxor for the weekend and on Saturday evening we reserved a table at this club, LAX.   One of their representatives approached us as we were dining at the café downstairs offering us a deal for a table that night and it was a two-for-one bottle deal, which we took advantage of. The deal was that we would get a bottle for free, however we would still be obligated to pay the service and tax on the second bottle, which we happily agreed to. Since there were 13 of us all together, 7 girls, 6 guys, the total bill came out to about $760.03.   Our waitress's name was Christina. When we arrived, we were kindly helped and checked at the door and escorted to our table. We were seated for about 15-20 minutes before our set-up was completed. Christina had brought over the tab and went over it all with my friend. He decided to upgrade our bottles to Hennessey and Grey Goose for an additional $110.00 fee. Another 10 - 15 minutes later, Christina finally brought our bottles to the table. When she began pouring drinks, she started with the Hennessey. She peeled off the wrapper and poured drinks. However, when she brought the Grey Goose bottle (which most of us were drinking) the bottle came to the table WITHOUT the wrapper on it. All she had to do was uncork the bottle. I was a bartender for two years and I know what the bottle looks like packaged out of the box. There is a blue wrapper that needs to be peeled off before the cork is removable. There was no wrapper when she brought it to the table. After the server had poured the first round of shots, I began serving the drinks, as there were so many people with us. We finished the bottle of Grey Goose within the first hour we were there and no one had gotten drunk. The vodka was heavily diluted and every one of us that drank it noticed it after not having felt any effects of the liquor, whatsoever.   I do not recommend coming to this club, as the other people posting are also right about the table situation... the whole top floor was EMPTY, no one was up there. But all the small booths on the bottom were over crowded and almost all filled. With the price you pay, you'd expect to be put upstairs in a bigger more spacious table. IMO, of course.

There are A LOT of tables and roped off sections. Only about 5 were booked and the other 50 were empty. Almost sad. The dance floor is a 6-8 foot walkway from one bar to the other and just a terrible set up all around. The music was horrendous! They were playing Flo Ridas  Sugar  which was great 3 years ago. It felt like an amateur DJ was at the wheels.  The drink was full of juice and such a blatant rip-off, I gave it back to the bartender. Club bartenders seem to forget that cups change size, so proportions should be adjusted. You can't pour 8 oz of juice and a shot and expect the drink to be the same.

The bouncer was a heavyset, dark Asian male with frizzy, unkempt hair.  I asked him if I could keep my eyedrops at the front with the staff while I headed inside and pick it up on my way out.   NO.    I need my eyedrops, I can't throw this away because the smoke in Las Vegas dries my eyes out.

We showed up around 11:20 to the most disorganized, ridiculous entry  line  I've ever seen. No one  knew where to go and the bouncers were completely unhelpful.  We texted our promoter for help and came up with nothing. He texted back a few times before blowing us off. He was extremely rude. If you are considering going to this club, reconsider.  But if you decide to go, do NOT use the promoter named Joshua Huggins. I'm not sure if he's incompetent or just doesn't know what's going on, but either way he is extremely rude.  I shouldn't say this because it's not very nice, but I think it's important to note that all the people who were standing in line to get in just.... were not attractive at all.

Our group got in right away because one of the bouncers pulled us up front (my friend assumed it was because we had a young group) Drinks: A little pricey though not sure if that is the standard fare ($15 for a Tic-Tac), not sure about table service Music: Music was alright.  DJ forced the mixes a little bit sometimes.  Some songs are fine the way they are. Crowd: Crowd was a little older than we had anticipated but definitely still young. Environment: Definitely has a dark gothic kinda feel as a lot of people have said.  Way too much of the club is dedicated to VIP booths and table service so very small dance floor.  Dance floor are is roped off so more like a long alley from one end of the club to the other.

Also, I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $30 to get into a club (reviewer Mai K. points out that this is the 'after midnight' cover charge for the ladies).  My first time at LAX was Nicky Hilton's bday party in 2007, & everyone was talking about the Hilton sisters back then. Naturally, everyone assumed that Paris would be there, & so the place was a sardine can. I remember asking 1 of the bouncers if Paris was in there. He said,  I think I just saw her walk right back in . I believed him 100%. I remember seeing maybe a few blonds in the VIP section - either everyone wanted to look like Paris back then, or a few of them were hired/invited to be mistaken for Paris. Nobody can really tell in a dark club, & we never saw Paris/Nicky that night. I dunno, maybe we came in late.  The VIP area, if I'm not mistaken, is the stage/area surrounding the stage. There are reserved seats near the back & on the upper level, & there are people making sure random people don't sit here. I'm not sure how much it costs to reserve these seats, but it's a  b  to be wearing clubbing shoes & not be able to sit down anywhere. It is what it is.   I went back a couple of times in 2011 to see some group - can't even remember their name - but I missed them. LAX was basically the same.

I thought it was a lot more beautiful than HAZE, but not up to par with XS. I would consider it in the same area as Vanity at Hard Rock. It has pretty staircases and a lot of detailing.   My girlfriends were planning my bachelorette party. Not so experienced with Vegas, they decided we should go to LAX. Mainly because my girlfriend was able to get us free bottle service and a table there. That is actually really hard to get, at any club on a weekend. I was a little hesistant at first because I like XS, but a free table is a free table. Plus we could always head out to the other clubs if this one wasn't happening.   We got there right when it opened. Checked in. Got in quickly. Got seated at this corner booth in the upper corner with a great view of the dancefloor. The drinks came out and we started to get comfortable.  Now initially it took the other club go-ers FOREVER to relax and party. God, the dance floor looked like a line at Disneyland. No one was really dancing or moving. It started gettings better after an hour or two and some alcohol consumption.   Anyways, the security guards there could not have been nicer, and cuter. :P We were moved to another table because another group was willing to pay 2000 grand for the booth. We were moved into the quieter room that you go through before the danceroom. It sucked at first, but we just consumed as much alcohol as possible and kept going back to the dancefloor. Now this is when the security guards got really nice. Since I was the bachelorette and with a lot of pretty girls, they came back to us and told us they are trying to move us back into the main room. 15 minutes later, we had another corner booth and right by the dance floor. I'm sure they could tell that we were the best bachelorette party there. :P   LESSON LEARNED? Just because this club is average doesn't mean that you will be having less fun than if you were at other trendier, new clubs. Anywhere can be have the best party if you have the right people with you, and that's exactly what happened for me and my girls. I honestly have not had so much fun in a club before.

For the record, having been to big clubs around the country, I've grown out of this stage of my life. Onto the review.  LAX is located inside of Luxor.  Walking up, there didn't appear to be any system that resembled a proper line.  Fortunately, I signed up on the guest list, so we stepped up to the VIP entrance.  The guy screening the list found my name, but said I only signed up for 1 person.  This is completely false and I hate this type of shadyness. So he said he'd take care of me, but someone would have to pay entry.  So even though I signed up, I still ended up paying a cover because of course they let my girlfriend in for free, but I had to pay 30 dollars. Yup. BS already. On the upside we only waited 5 minutes, which was really nice and made the gf happy.  Anyway, the layout and decor of this place is pretty damn cool.  It's very gothy and dark. The sound and light systems are fantastic. Yup. That's about all I got for the good.  Like some of the other reviewers said, this place is stupid packed. Now being a hot club, I sort of expected it.  However, we couldn't even dance without jackasses slamming into us.  And that's what it was like across the entire floor.  The music was passable for the first 30 minutes we were there and then it switched over to nothing but rap. No dance music, just hip hop. Imagine a few hundred people wedged into one area all grinding on each other. It was disgusting.  On top of that, there was no good path through the crowd so people were trying to move back and forth through that crowd all night.  Drinks. Yeah, well, they were outrageous. My cocktail ran 18 dollars.  It also took 20 minutes to get while maneuvering in crowds that weren't unlike those that were on the dance floor.  Restrooms? I have no idea. I had one cocktail and didn't dare venture to find the restroom.  And like Yasmin said, the friggin security is ridiculous.  They pretty much ring the whole dance floor.  While I didn't feel like there would be a fight (I was getting close to swinging at one guy who almost knocked my drink out of my hand twice, but only came close) I did get that feeling like I was in prison.  The VIP bottle service seems like the way to go here. But I'm not stupid or rich enough to drop $550 with tip to hang out at a place where we had no room to enjoy ourselves.  So bottom line, $30 cover + $22 cocktail with tip + douche central + poor management = I will not be coming back here.

My girlfriend and i were approached by a guy in the lobby offering us free VIP entry into the club. We were going to the LUXOR for a nice steak dinner and to enjoy one of the shows. We told the guy that our show did not get out until midnite and her said that he would hold our names until 1am.  after a good dinner and great show, we approached the entrance to LAX. The customer service was non-existant. The people working at the door dont even acknowledge people trying to get. after being ignored by the blond lady with the notepad, we finally got another guy to check for our names on the list.  We got past the first set of ropes and the bouncer refused to let my girlfriend in the club despite her having a valid Illinois license and her military id. They passed her ids along without even acknowledging out questions or explaining their actions. They could not give us a valid reason for not accepting the id, even when we contacted the hotel manager who verified her valid id.  Hotel security had her sign her name to verify her signature for no apparent reason before turning us away. What a bunch of idiots. The hotel manager was the only voice of reason and she even contacted the manager at the club Mark Han who couldn't explain it either but still would not let us in. Ridiculous!  We have gone to many other places on the strip and have never had any issues and are ofter approached while visiting hotels by hotel personnel soliciting us to come to their clubs so this was unbelievable.  My only guess is this place descriminates against me as a minority or military personnel or who knows what. They told the hotel manager that they didnt want our business. They ruined a great night for us and I would recommend going to many of the other clubs that appreciate your business. LAX gets a fail. This place SUX.

Pros: I got in for free with 3 free vodka based drinks from 1030 - midnight. Music was fun, lot's of variety from latin, pop, hip hop, good diversity. No wait to get in. Everyone working was very nice. I also liked that it wasn't all just young people, there were all age groups in there.... I like a place that's friendly to everyone.   Cons: It's on the less popular end of the strip so it's less lively. Dress code not enforced at all. I thought it was bizarre that the young man in front of me who tried to get into the club wasn't allowed in because he was wearing a t-shirt & not a button up but when I went inside I noticed there were tons of women wearing loose jeans & sneakers like they were going to their neighborhood target. Sooooo women get in for free with complimentary drinks & don't have to dress accordingly but a man who is willing to pay $20 can't come in just because he's wearing a shirt? Weirddddd. I just feel like if you're going to enforce dress code do it for all especially when you're losing money not allowing the one guy willing to pay to come in when the club wasn't packed at all the entire night.    The thing I disliked the most was that unless you are paying for bottle service there is NOWHERE to sit & if you try to take your shoes off in the corner away from everyone & rest your feet a worker will tell you (kindly, because like I said the workers were well mannered & props to them for that) to keep one shoe on at least. I made an effort that night, wore heels & a nice dress but I'm not encouraged to do so again if I can't find a place to rest for a few minutes. I can manage heels for a pretty long time but 3 hours straight is asking too much. My only choice was to go to the restroom when there was no one waiting & chill on the toilet only to get the door slammed open by the towel lady who probably thought I was dying in the bathroom stall.   I had a decent enough time there & considering the ladies deal they have, I may visit this club again when I have my girlfriends in town. However I'd opt for dressy, flat shoes because it's not worth getting all dolled up only to suffer while everyone else is having fun in converse sneakers.", "Date": "2015-11-10", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "PhJf-Kv69QCqDRhK_eW8JA", "Overall": "2", "Content": "This new  hot  Vegas club isn't that  hot .

IT was pretty cool, because we got in for free (we stayed @ Luxor) the doormen tried to not let my guy cousin in for free, but we had guest listed, and he was with 3 girls, so they let him by. The entrance is really pretty, but its also very dark. And they have this weird padded thing @ the end of the hall that takes up the whole room almost. I guess the effect is nice because the lighting is a different color, but whatever. I really like how you enter the main club though, there is this huge stair case and it's beautiful. Unfortunately it isn't very well lit, so we stuck to the sides and held onto the hand rail.   It was really easy to get a drink and they were made pretty well. I kept going back to the same bartender, and tipped well every time, so we got a round and a few shots free (it always pays to be nice).   The music was good, but there was *no*room*to*dance* the dance floor is really small and narrow, and there is all this seating behind it that was roped off and UNUSED!!!

After the forty-some-odd minute ordeal of waiting in the one of the most disorganized VIP herds (... yes,  herd , there was NO semblance of a line there, whatsoever), finally getting into LAX is underwhelming.  The interior design of the club is rather non-descript (if a little boring); black walls, black floors, black bartops, a rafter of candles over the DJ booth, a large projected  LAX  spanning half the height of the room...  Book-end'd by bars, the first floor simply a long floorspace, with VIP/bottleservice booths along one length (under the second floor balconys) and two tiers of VIP booths running along the other length (bi-sected by the DJ booth).  The actual dancing space for non-VIPs is a roped-off area down the center of the room (maybe MAYBE 30' wide by 100-or-so' long).  Upstairs, accessible by ballroom-esque stairs on either side of the room, four (or six?) VIP rooms overlooking the first floor run the length of one side of the room, opposite the DJ.  A large nonVIP balcony (the best spot in the club) provides a great vantage point and also remains roomy enough for people who actually like to dance rather than move side-to-side in cramped quarters.  I recall one bar upstairs (crowded as all get-out!), but there may have been one at the other end as well.  The music was a mixed bag... DJ Vice(?) out of Southern California does a eclectic set of music, playing everything from radio grade hip-hop to house to throwback mash-ups, visiting every genre a little too often.

Avoid this club and the douchebags that run it like the plague. There is a Fat bald bouncer out front who thinks because he has a clipboard and an earpiece in his ear that he is curing cancer... Hate to tell him, but he's not. I am a drummer and I have played way better places than this clown is the glorified doorman at. I am attaching a copy of a letter I wrote to a promoter who I sponsored a party at this dump with. The names have been changed to protect the innocent.   Grab a beverage, light up a stogie, and recline the Lazy Boy... this one is good.  *** Warning - Explicit Language***      Hello Adam,  As you already know and heard from people, I was completely humiliated and made a fool in front of over 200 people at the party we sponsored Saturday night at LAX/Luxor.   Upon arrival with three others attending with me I spot Pete G behind the rope by the entrance. I know from past parties I see him, he gets us through the line.  I walk up to Pete and say Hi, and I was immediately berated by a bald Bouncer who in front of everyone screams  No fuckin' way is he coming in with that Jersey on!  He was referring to my $300 Authentic Black Desean Jackson Philly Eagles Jersey. I turned to him and said bro I sponsored this party $3000.00 it cost me.  I Don't Give A Fuck  he says. I turn to Pete and was like what is this guy's deal. The bouncer then commented that he didn't like my $130.00 Columbia Dark Grey boots.  Pete now moved us to another section and claimed he would take care of this... As we moved I see the guy pointing at his wrist and telling another bouncer that I need to cover up my Eagles Tattoo.   The guys was over the line from the get go. Pete asked If I had another shirt to put on over the jersey. My buddy had happened to have a button down shirt on top of another shirt and offered to let me wear that. The Bouncer interjected no that's his shirt I know that's his shirt not yours. I look at Pete and was like what the fuck is this guy's problem? Pete said there's a gift shop right next door can you go buy a T shirt? I said fine, I'll buy a shirt. I went next door bought a black shirt with jewels and sequins on it because it was the only shirt that would fit over my arms... Long Sleeve so it covers my tattoo. Another bouncer approaches me and politely asks please keep the shirt on in the club and not to just take it off after entry and wear the jersey I said no problem.  As I was answering I see the guy pointing at my Boots again! I said you know what fuck this. I unbuttoned the shirt, returned it at the gift shop and called it a day.    The kicker is one guy I was with had New balance Sneaks on... they were ok, and a guy in my booth early that day spilled Cranberry Juice all over himself and was staying in another hotel, I lent him a $12 White Miller light shirt that I wear to wash my car on the weekend, and he was let in with that very shirt! Not sure what was up that guy's crawl, but I truly did not deserve that kind of treatment on a night in which I had just been alerted that I won an AVN award, and spent $3000.00 on sponsoring a party.  It was totally unprovoked and uncalled for. There are two ways you talk to people, and somebody needs to teach that guy the difference. Just because your standing in front of a club with and earpiece and a clipboard doesn't mean that you're curing cancer. I didn't get his name, but he really shouldn't have a job there.

It's pretty dark in there, but you can still manage to see who's watching you. They could manage to move the VIP ropes back some more on both sides. This would create more dance floor room for all the people crammed there. There is also no where to sit unless you buy bottles. So if standing is an issue to you, bypass this one. We saw a lady with her shoes off. Poor thing!! As dark as it is in there, one of the a-hole bouncers shined his light on her and told her she had to put them back on. Oh yeah, since you're enclosed in the building,  it can get kind of hot... So bring a sweat tag and wear lots of deodorant!! Another thing I didn't really care for was the smoking.

Contrary to what some of the other reviewers mentioned, I really only saw mostly good looking people here.  A little heavy on the testosterone, but plenty of (attractive, young) females, as well.   I mostly stick to shots (can't go wrong with those, really), so I can't say whether the drinks are  good ...and I didn't actually pay for any of mine, so I don't even know what drink prices are like here.  I remember feeling a little frustrated when trying to find the restroom (all the way to the back), but the shots could've had something to do with that.

What was really funny was that when we were in line to get in to Pure the night after LAX, I heard a few songs, and I was like,  Wow, isn't that what we heard last night?   When we finally walked in, guess who was DJing.... the same damn DJ from LAX playing the SAME DAMN MUSIC in the SAME ORDER!!  How lazy are DJs these days?  This fool acted like he was mixing, but really he was just playing a damn iTunes playlist off his MacBook.    Okay, enough with my complaining.  The one good thing was that my girlfriends and I really did have fun dancing here.  The dance floor is pretty small, but we got there early enough to save ourselves a little spot.  We would have fun dancing anywhere, though!

We were walking through the casino lobby at the Luxor  trying to figure out where the club was when a security guy stopped us and asked us if we were going to LAX.  I don't know what his first clue could've been, since we were all dressed to the 9's in our best push up bras...Anyway, he gave us bracelets and told us to go  straight to the VIP area to be let in.  I don't know why we didn't turn and run when we saw roughly 400-500 people waiting to get in.  We walked straight up to the burly bouncer said we were on a list, showed our bracelets and walked in much to the dismay of the other 500 people behind us...Believe me people, I would've had a better time in line waiting to get in.  You walk up the stairs and around some cylinder looking thing and back down the stairs.  No dance floor to speak of just a walk way which after thinking about it now is like the conveyer belt at the grocery store--the guys look at all the meat going by and pick the freshest cuts---after my 4  heels were starting to kill my feet, I started to look around for a place to plop my butt down.  The bouncer said that,  you have to be invited to sit down   Are you kidding me??  Never one to listen to rules, I lifted the rope and sat down.  Luckily the guy I plopped down next too didn't kick me out, but instead offered me a drink.    The music is ok, but there is no room to dance.  The space is filled with newly minted 21 year olds, groping their way through the floor and a whole lot of people high off their butts.

It was a little scary when their bouncers outside started asking my drunk homie a whole bunch of questions, but it was mainly to make sure that he was over 21 and didn't have alcohol poisoning...at least I think that's why they did that. They were cool about it though, so it was all good.  The interior of the club was nothing special. As a few other reviewers have noted, that dance floor is tiny, narrow, and packed. Being on that dance floor was like being stuck in a can with very sexy sardines.

The staircase is kind of a nice touch, but as some of you have probably learned from experience, drunk folks and staircases aren't exactly a good mix.

Luckily we happened to get into the VIP section which I would recommend to anyone who plans on coming here and their need to sit down is a major priority.  All in all, this place knows the right music to play in a club atmosphere. We go to nightclubs to DANCE, drink and have a good time.

And if there's anything I learned about 'VIP' passes easily acquired are not truly 'VIP' but merely what everyone else is doing. Either which way we ended up killing some time in the wrong line after seeing the girls go in we were then told that the 'VIP' line to wait in was around the corner. Another drink and another wait and finally we get in.   WHEN IN VEGAS - GET A BOTTLE.   Otherwise after waiting in a much smaller line... There were a lot of stairs leading to and from the main floor to the second floor that over looked the organic miasma that was the dance floor. The bar was hard to get to but easier to actually get a drink. All in all I have come to the conclusion that it was not so bad, and not so good. It was packed, it was hot, large portions were roped off for tables but we found great seats off to the side for all to get trashed at and make moves at and easy to look at and laugh at from.

My boyfriend and I only decided to show up here because we were staying at Excalibur and were given a  free admission for two before 12 am.  coupon. We showed up at 12, but had to wait in a line and didn't get in until 12:15. Okay, so I was hoping they would honor the coupon anyway, but figured they would at least give us some kind of discounted rate. Well, the woman working the  cash box  or whatever it is just looked at us and said,  no, i'm not taking those anymore and it's $90 for the both of you. $60 for him, $30 for you.   WHAT?!!!!!  I have been to and partied in Vegas a myriad of times and never, NEVER has some club, especially of the likes of LAfreakingX had the audacity to charge such outrageous prices for entrance. I stopped my boyfriend from handing over his credit card, asked her to repeat herself, responded with,  hell to the no,  performed an About Face and started to make our way out. One of the bouncer/security guard dudes caught my reaction and our attempt to leave and stopped us trying to figure out why we were so disgusted. In hopes to keep our business, he offered to slash the cost in half. Just like that. In a snap, from $90 to $45. In retrospect, any place that obviously inflates their admission like that shouldn't have received any of our business, but since we were there already, we decided to take the offer.  Mistake.   Underwhelmed. The dance floor is small and ridiculously cramped. The club does offer some space, but the majority of it was roped off for  VIP  or  Bottle Service  that no one seemed to take advantage of. Probably because this place sucks major bolas. So you have a super cramped dance floor, and empty space you can't even use. Drink prices were ridiculous. $28 for two drinks. What kind of crack are they smoking? I may have been able to overlook all of this if the one key factor in a great club existed: Great Music. Negative on this as well. The music here was hours of the same Auto-Tuned hip hop crap that sounds like one constant stream of yuckiness. There were the occasional Biggie or Jay-Z hits sprinkled in. Enough for me to shake it for a minute or two, but then back to the same old crap. It's funny how much more your feet hurt in heels when you're busy not having a good time or not enjoying the music.

Yes, it is not one of the newer  super  clubs here in Vegas (ex: XS, Tryst, Marquee, etc), but it still serves its purpose.  I have been here quite a few times and ALWAYS have fun.  I've also brought out of town friends here and they've had a blast as well.  I guess we are easy to please?  *shrugs*  99% of the clubs here are cramped when you don't have a table.  That's the benefit of shelling out the dough (or having good connections) to have a VIP table.  So stop complaining about it!  What is it you are expecting when you get a wristband, along with 1000 other people?  I'll tell you what you should expect: to wait in a very looooong line and to have to stand around once you get inside.  I've been here general admission and with a table.  I've never had a problem getting a drink or with any staff member being rude to me.  I've also not noticed anything memorable about the bathroom being soooo far away or small.  Must be all of you getting there early and having too many of the  free  drinks with your wristbands who spend all of your time in the restroom!  Now, about the music - it's actually why I like this place!  Most of the clubs here play crap (IMO).  I am not in to fist pumping, dubstep or whatever.  I like hip hop, and I always hear it when I am at LAX.  Also, there is a semi-hidden entrance to Savile Row from inside LAX, and when we've been there, we are always walked in for after hours, where the party keeps going until the wee hours.

They talk about them all the time and you have seen a couple photos but really can't tell what they look like? You however are really excited to meet them and see what the hype has been about. Then you meet them. Yea.  That's what LAX is like to me. This place was easily my most disappointing Vegas club that I have been to. I don't want to discourage you from going here entirely as it might be your speed but really if this is left off of your trip plans you aren't missing that much.   I had heard about LAX even before I had touched down in Vegas as a place to go. I think its one of the more recognizable names in clubs in Vegas for that reason. When we went to LAX there was a performance by Fabolous who seems to haunt my Vegas adventures by showing up when I don't want him to. Before he came out though it was a regular club night with dancing on the main dancefloor for about 3 hours. But really the thing about LAX is nothing really stands out. It feels like a club I would find in San Antonio or San Francisco. There is nothing about it that screams Vegas. The décor is pretty awful and old school. The dancefloor was crowded and there were just so many people standing around. Whether on the outside or near the VIP it was just a ton of people standing around looking at each other. It felt like the club just hadn't started yet for some reason.   The crowd that was there that night was ROUGH. Like this was the first Vegas club that I have seen someone get into a fight. Usually I love Vegas because everyone is having such a good time celebrating something that no one cares or has time for a fight but people showed up here looking to start shit and people were getting pushed for no reason it was a little ridiculous. It wasn't worth the cover charge or the long long walk it takes to get down to the Luxor. Seriously the location is awful unless you are staying in the MGM, Luxor or Excalibur. You have to commit your night to that end of the strip then find  a way to get back to your place midstrip or the other end. There are just so many better clubs midstrip that it feels like a waste being stuck down here all night.   Honestly it's a testament that in the over ten times I have been to Vegas to club in the past four year that LAX was on the first trip but never even mentioned again as an option to go to again. That is pretty much the sentiment most people have about the place that I have talked to as well. It's fun but its not really fun enough to go back to. Its worth it if you are down that way or just have never tried it but have grown tired of your usual spots. But if I wanted to feel like I was in the LA club I would stay in California.", "Date": "2015-03-30", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Rhia", "ReviewID": "338oR74h6FcMkz7RA4BN7Q", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Saturday night's plan was to head to XS. I think homegirl and I should have stuck to it, despite the extremely long line it had. Then again, we saved ourselves a $70 cover charge by heading back to our HQ at Luxor. Debating on whether or not to meet  with our other friend or party, I said,  To hell with it. I wanna party!  A guy had stopped us earlier asking if we were going to LAX anyways, so we approached him while he was still at the lobby entrance and got bracelets to get in for free. The line, excuse me lines, weren't as hectic as the ones for Privé on Friday. We were in there in about 15 minutes. Once I was down the stairs, I remembered my main con with this club: the dance floor. It's packed and people will find a way to get through it. No, they won't care if you're with anyone, they'll still do it. Fortunately, it didn't bother me since  1) I didn't have to pay to get in. 2) The music wasn't bad. 3)The long island I got from the bar was good. & 4) Some random guy in the vip area above the floor was throwing out several handfuls of dollar bills like it was nothing. Luckily homegirl and I were at a spot where majority of the money landed. I made an easy $10 and she got enough to cover the bar tip and pay for coat check. Sah-weet! We could have stayed longer, but my feet weren't having it. This is the only Vegas club that I've been to twice. Okay, been there done that.

There is a pathway where a constant flow of people were interrupting my sweet moves.   The Saturday night DJ was just okay. He played a pretty good array of music but the mix was choppy and had more than a couple awkward pauses.   For guys staying at Luxor or Excalibur, there is a coupon in the booklet given at check-in for two people to get in free to LAX before midnight. This is sweet since the cover charge for guys is $30 or more each usually. Get in line by at least 11 p.m. to make it in before midnight though. Snails pace, remember?

It was PACKED inside and as we tried to maneuver to the bar, a bouncer invited us to a table.  A group of gentlemen who did not use their table to be gropey (nor did our group of females use them for alcohol) had us come over for a place to dance, talk, and have a few drinks.  Then we walked around and made friends with a girl at the upstairs area of tables who was waiting for her group of guy friends and invited us to hang out with her in the meantime.  Her table view was GORGEOUS and we had a great time dancing over the balcony with the stranger.

First off, if you don't have bottle service, don't go to this club, the club is set up for about 90% tables/bottle service. So Ladies DO NOT go to this cub if you just want to get your dance on and a couple of drinks. The only thing I really loved about the club is the sexy sleek decor of the club. Here's my experience with LAX:  I went to Vegas a few weeks ago for a friend's 30th birthday. There was a group of about 20-30 of us, and we already had bottle service set up the week before we came, had a list of all our people etc so when we got there it wouldn't be an issue.   The entire group arrived at 10:30 ready to go to our  ultra vip  section. We got to the club and the outside was packed with people, we ended up waiting about 25 minutes to even get inside the club. From my experience in Vegas. most clubs walk you right in if you have bottle service, especially if you are giving them business with 30 people in the group.   We finally got inside the club, and our bottle service wasn't even set up!  So there we were 30 of us ready to party and had to wait another 15 minutes for everything to be set up...and the club considered it  ULTRA VIP?   They title the seperate sections upstairs ultra VIP, and while they were cool, I suggest getting a table on the dance floor level to be near all the action. My friends and I went down to dance a couple of times, and the dance floor is super small and too packed to even want to try and get in there. If you try to dance on the side or anywhere other then the middle of the dance floor, security will ask you for a wrist band to go anywhere! Now i've partied at a lot of places with high end celebs etc, and when you are considered  ULTRA  VIP, I think you should get a wristband for all access/ anywhere in the club!  So all in all, I had an awesome time, but it was because of the people I was with, it had nothing to do with the rest of the club.   Ohh, and the LUXOR will try to get you with saying your key cards will work as free access, but I don't think it's worth it, plus the LUXOR is not one of my favorite hotels.", "Date": "2008-04-13", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Lyndsey", "ReviewID": "aBcK1QqIQn7xA3Lx1u47Zg", "Overall": "3", "Content": "I agree with other reviews that the layout of the club is not working in its favor.

First off I need to say Luxor is one of the least *fancy* hotels in Vegas, and it's almost always the cheapest on the strip, so I wasn't expecting 5 star service/luxury. Me and my group of 4 girls went right when it was opening at about 10:30 because we knew it would be crowded (celebrity performance that night). I had put my name on the guest list online, so I asked and go in to the guest list  mob  I'd say this was the most unpleasant part of the night. I worked my way up to the front, being pushed and shoved. I don't understand why they don't have a formal line like they do for the  regular line . Would have taken 2 seconds to set up some ropes. Finally got to the bouncer and I told him I'm on the list and I have 4 girls, so he looked me up and we waited a minute or two (while they let in some better looking girls ahha) then ID's were checked, and we went to the pay area. I showed some random VIP cards and my room keys, and they let us in free. (my guess is you would get in free if you are a hot chick also). I'd also say pretty much forget going unless you have a LOT of girls in your group, they don't want guys at all.   We went straight to the bathroom which was fine, then went to dance, it wasn't very full at this point. The dance floor is tiny. The pictures do it no justice, it's very little and narrow. I went to stand near the barricade so I could be close to the performance when it started. The security was pretty anal. I had a water and the guy got mad at me, but said just put it away... (I don't drink).  But understandable. After a few hours, spilled drinks were causing people to slip and fall on the floor, security would just pick up the barricades.. not clean up the mess... which was annoying, but not too bad. After the performance at about 1 am the dance floor was SO FULL you couldn't barely move, so we decided to leave. It wasn't fun anymore at that point.   Looks like table service would be nice here! Sound is fantastic, the music was strange, they were spinning like early 2000's hip hop.. haha. Hit Em Up Style? it's 2010 ahha.  The artist I like was spinning after he performed but like I said it was so uncomfortable we left after about 20 minutes.   My advice would be go early, leave early, bring TONS of girls if you are a guy, put yourself on the guestlist on facebook or twitter or whatever, and remember it's very small!

LAX nightclub was in our hotel and that night there was a notorious DJ scheduled to perform so we figured we'd check it out and hear the music we all love. Unfortunately, that excitement was short lived.   We were on a guest list which granted us free admission to the club, however we still did wait in line for a longer time than hoped for. While in line, we started realizing that the standards for the club were pretty low. Some of the people that were getting in the club were dressed for the grocery store rather than a Las Vegas club, and the arguing bunch next to us heated up and a fight nearly broke out but security finally ended that. Even still, we brushed it off and kept our hopes high that maybe it was better once inside.   The layout of LAX is impressive with tasteful red leather furnishings and stylish chandeliers. The entrance to the dance floor is grand and you feel like royalty (if royalty wore sexy dresses or hip club wear) as you ascend down the stairs, which are reminiscent to the staircase at the Royal Ball in  Cinderella.  The enthusiasm stops at the bottom of the staircase. The floor was over crowded with people and by the time we squirmed over to the bar across the way, frustration started to settle in. In the midst of your lowered spirits, the bartender explains there is no free water and the tiniest bottle of water is $8. Fine.   The music was hip-hop but was outdated but was still good music to dance to. We thought maybe the DJ was warming up while everyone waited for the star DJ that was coming. It feels like what made this experience a bad one for us was just the crowd that was patronizing the club that night. We were hoping for a bit more sophistication and class but the people there were just the opposite.  The club was appealing and the music was okay... it may just not have been our scene.

LAX is one of the older clubs on the Strip and the decor shows. The sound system isn't that great either. Club layout consists of two floors. Table locations upstairs looks nice, but they are far away from the main dance floor. The main floor is a little on the smaller side, so it gets insanely packed in here.  So why would you come here? Bottle service is a little cheaper. Lower minimums and bottle prices, so if you're on a budget but still want to set up bottle service for your occasion, LAX may be a good choice. If you are anti-EDM, this is also a viable option because they play open format/hip-hop. DJ played alot of Drake, 2Chainz, A$AP Rocky, etc.  FInal thoughts? I wouldn't pay cover to come in here. Another thing to keep in mind is that the Luxor is a little far away from the central Strip. If I was venturing down at this end, I would rather visit Hakkasan at the MGM or the Light at the Mandalay Bay.

The music is exactly what you would want it to be at a dance club- songs that you recognize that are easy to dance to.    Now to the bad...  Yes, drinks are incredibly expensive.  Here is what I recommend- Drink before you go in.  There is a Fat Tuesdays right upstairs and numerous bars around the Luxor.  Avoid the lines at the bar by showing up tipsy.  It will give you more time to dance with all the hotties on the dance floor.    Avoid the line by going during the week.  This is Vegas, the clubs are going to be hopping regardless of the day of the week.  Club representatives will often stand by the front doors of the Luxor in the evenings during the week trying to get people to go to the club.  If you ask, they will put you on the VIP list and you will get in for free.  I went on a Thursday- There were plenty of people in the club but I didn't wait or pay.  On a Saturday, you will stand in a line and pay up to $30 to get in.  Girls- Don't bring a purse!  The club is crowded and it will just end up getting in the way.  There is no place to put it safely.  Either bring just a wristlette or make your man carry your ID and lipstick.  Also, wear your flip-flops.

Like seriously, I'm surprised that the fire marshall didn't come shut the place down. On the plus side, at least you don't have to worry about moving your feet when you dance because there is NO room to move your feet. It was also incredibly hot inside and IMO the only place where you should see people sweating is at the gym. Combine all this with people drinking, smoking and wearing cheap Forever 21 nylon on the dance floor and it's a disaster just waiting to happen.

Before, when it was still called 'Ra' it was crowded, it was fun, and there was always someone new to meet.   My girls and I unknowingly planned our trip to Las Vegas for Memorial Day weekend. I say unknowingly because I know better than to go to Las Vegas during a holiday weekend. Too many people (I just don't do big crowds), too many drunks, and clubs become too expensive. However, it wasn't my birthday and that weekend worked so we went.   We hit LAX the last night of our stay in Vegas (Sunday night). We got scammed by some dude selling club passes on the strip (in front of Caesar's, don't give him your money) so we knew it would a rough night of clubbing ahead of us. We decided to just go for it and headed to the Luxor. We weren't on a list, we didn't have passes, we were doing it 'the regular way' which I haven't done since I first started clubbing (about 10 years ago). We expected the cover to be insane, especially when we discovered that Ginuwine was performing (don't judge me, I still love Ginuwine). We were told that the cover was $20, but we could expect to pay more by the time we got to the door. Totally understandable, this is Vegas, the goal is to make money.  We got to the door in record time (less than an hour of waiting in line, score!), and we only paid $30 to get in. I look at this as a bargain because it was a holiday weekend, other clubs were charging much more and there was a performance that night.  The only real problem we had was that the club was so packed. It was really hard to finish my drink without spilling it on myself (thanks to the thousands of people milling back and forth bumping in to me). After Ginuwine performed a lot of people left so it was easier to dance. Easier, not easy. It was still super packed, no real dancing could be done and getting off the dance floor was very tricky.

I don't think the DJ was aware that it's 2008 because I only  heard one song from this year.  I hate when I go to a club to dance and the music disappoints.  Return of the Mack  was hot when it came out in '96, but it's '08 and the song is not old enough to be a throwback.  The decor is cool, the club is cool looking, but it's really small.  The ceilings are extremely high so that opens it up a bit. But, there is no dedicated dance floor.  Essentially the narrow walkway doubles as dance floor and you have to fight for space to walk and dance and inevitably some drunk idiot will fall or spill their drink on you.    There is however, tons of space for people who buy bottle service.  The majority of the club was roped off for VIP and bottle-service purchasing patrons.    It was pretty easy to get in, the line moved quickly and the bouncers did a good job of keeping it orderly.  If you get a free VIP pass, you save half off of the cover charge.

Now, I did spend New Year's Eve here with the Black Eyed Peas so I knew it was going to be crowded - but it was PACKED. The fire marshall would've died. We were the first ones in and staked out a fantastic spot on the balcony. It got so crowded they closed off the steps, and people were pushing and shoving so hard that I was afraid I was going to fall over the railing. They allowed people to smoke which was stupid, especially with such a huge crowd. I was purposely burnt by some girl trying to get my  spot.  After a 40-year-old man felt me up and the club security standing next to me did nothing, I lost it. It was about 12:30, I saw the BEP lip-sync three songs, I was done. I got out just before I had a major panic attack. When we did get outside, they had stopped the line of people from entering, which sucks. They basically spent $125 to be there for NYE, only to be left outside because it was oversold. If that was me I woulda been pissed (and trust me, they were!). The bottle service areas were really nice, especially the ones across from the balcony which we got in. If it's a possibility, I recommend bottle service here - you're guaranteed a MUCH better time, since you won't get crushed.  The club itself is gorgeous, and I was happy I had about 30 minutes in there with just my two girlfriends to explore it by ourselves. I would never pay to get in here, but as a girl I don't think that'll ever be an issue. To me, experiencing Vegas on NYE the year I turned 21 was a great time, and worth what I paid, but I don't think I'd come back to this club unless I'd seen everywhere else first or purchased bottle service. It was impossible to get a drink, and the wayyyyy dangerous over-capacity and carelessness of the security were all huge turnoffs.   The only reason we paid was because it was a special ticketed event. Otherwise, I agree - if you pay to get in places in Vegas, especially if you're a girl, you're either dumb or, as Mariangeles put it, can't hustle!

We got there after 10 pm and were able to skip the line and the cover charge (they have a Ladies Line). Once inside we were offered seating in the VIP area which was amazing! They even let us dance up on a platform. Unfortunately, that fairy tale ended when someone actually purchased the table, but it was fun while it lasted. The staff in and around the VIP area were very cool and accommodating even though we hadn't paid to be there.  The bartender mixed a nice strong Patron margarita, and I didn't think $14 was too bad a price for that considering Bud Lights were $10. I'll pay the extra $4 and get top shelf liquor, thanks. The DJ played really good music; kind of a top 40/hip hop/dance mash-up. The only thing was, like others have said, he would switch songs too soon and there were a few times the whole club stopped dancing because there wasn't a good beat going. Side note: the music was extremely loud. It took a good hour after we left for my ears to stop ringing. Not a complaint, just a comment. The bouncers outside the VIP area weren't quite so cool, and them waving their little flashlights around got annoying (major power trip). All in all, this was a better club experience than I've had in the past, although that is probably because in the past I've always had guys with me and this time I was with a group of ladies.

However, if you do it right, you'll have some fun.  The cover for ladies is free before midnight.  This place gets packed FAST and it's probably because the dance floor is tiny because the table service gets a lot of room which I am guessing is about 85% of the place and it was a Friday when I went. And since it gets pretty crowded, it can be annoying getting from point A to point B without bumping into someone or getting bumped. It is also VERY dark when it comes to lighting.  Drinks are pretty pricey and can attack your wallet/account, not sure about cover for guys and girls, but there is a way to avoid this, and that way is to buy a VIP pass online for $50 which let's you in earlier/cuts the line, admission included AND an open bar from 10:30-12:30; so obviously come early if you want free drinks without paying taxes. I recommend drinking at least 3 to get your entire VIP pass worth it. Sometimes the drinks are STRONG and then there are times when they're enjoyable. The bartenders were pretty friendly, no complaints. The music was predominately hip hop ranging from 90s-today with a little bit of EDM which is a little different than majority of the strip. Sometimes the mashups between songs were horrible but then there were the good ones. I had a great time since I took advantage of the online deal and you might too if you do the same because paying a high price for drinks *cough* Hakkasan *cough* can be depressing for poor college kids like myself haha. So why three stars? Because it's not quite up to par with the rest of the strip's nightclubs but the VIP ticket was a money saver plus I was kicked out of the club for dancing all crazy with friends (pretty much our group was getting low and sometimes all fours), instead I was just told by a laughing security guard that all of us needed to calm down haha", "Date": "2014-01-13", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Charmayne", "ReviewID": "WcPUtdj5Gaa5hdJyoYF08w", "Overall": "1", "Content": "3 consecutive shots within 15 minutes + never ending strobe lights = out of body experience.

I showed up on a Wed. night and was on a promoter's guestlist, so I was told my gf and I would get free admission. To be honest, I wasn't really expecting to get in for free, but I figured I'd try anyway.  Arrival: We went on a Wed night, close to 10 pm, but the bouncer at the door told us to come back in about 30 mins. Stupidly, we left and went to play some table games. When we returned, there was a mob of people waiting on line.  As with most clubs, there were multiple lines, and it's important to know the distinctions between them:  - all girls line: self explanatory. If you're with a group of girls, show up here and get in (for free I believe). - bottle service line: again, a very fast moving line. Just show up here (all the way on the right) and tell them you want a bottle, and go right in. - general admission: the longest line, but it at least moved. if you want to pay full price, then get on here and get inside in about 10-20 mins - guestlist line: if you sign up to be on a promoter's guestlist, you get put on this line. the line wasn't particularly long, but it barely moved at all. (This even though our promoter showed up at the front of the line and we talked with him, and he asked the bouncers to let us in sooner).  Anyway, we waited on line for close to an hour before we finally got in - thankfully at no charge for either of us.  Inside:   you walk downstairs into the main area, basically a narrow dance floor with a bar on the outer edge. There was also a cash only bar by the bathrooms that had no line, so we got beers there instead.  $8 miller lights (didn't ask about mixed drinks, but I'm assuming they were in the $15 range). The dance floor was packed, but we found a little niche in the middle that we set up shop in.   There was a huge screen inside that showed random upcoming events and celebrities.  The outer edge of the dance floor was surrounded by the table area, as well as another area farther up. We didn't really venture too far though.  Music / crowd  Decent music, as good as you'd expect at any club. Nothing really stood out, though. As far as the crowd, again it looked no different than any club in NYC.  Summary:  LAX was decent, but it didn't stand out in any way. I've been to lounges back home (like Lana in Hoboken) that were almost identical, but without the need to wait an hour on line. If you can get comped admission (either by getting on a guestlist or by being a hotel guest), then it might be worth checking out early in the evening.

Already kinda drunk in line, I wondered why the ef it was taking so long to get in, considering I was grouped with the other girls in the group.

I think they paid the bouncer. Moving along...  I remember going up these flight of stairs (not fun in 4 inch heels) and going down another flight of stairs (again kinda scary in my heels). I observed the surroundings in the club and to be quiet honest, I wasn't really surprised.  The club is designed in a weird way...it's like a rectangular club. In order to get drinks you have to pass through the  dancefloor  which sucked because people kept pushing. Thank god I was like 5'11 that night or else I would've been stepped on.  VIP looked nice and two of the girls were lucky enough to hustle their way up there and I could have gone, but didn't want the boyfriend to get angry hahaha.  Enough of my babbling. LAX was okay.

I always heard about LAX since this is supposedly the club that Paris, the cast of Hills, etc. like to go to. The club inside was just ok. Yeah, it's nice, but  it wasn't anything very Vegas-esque. One small dance floor on the bottom, with about 50% of the bottom floor dedicated to VIP tables. And the second floor has balconies, etc. which is pretty cool.  One good thing about this club was that the drinks weren't too expensive, compared to other clubs in Vegas.

Overall, my girlfriends came here on our own for a girl's night out and had a lot of fun. They played a good mix of different types of music - lots of oldies and new stuff. All of the music played was fun, upbeat, and something you would want to dance to (unlike other clubs that play music that makes you stop and think WTF?)

I'm glad I didn't have to pay cover, danced with some cute guys, but I would never go back.", "Date": "2008-04-29", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Sheri", "ReviewID": "ycbrINxxTyJMEIc5PJpKgQ", "Overall": "2", "Content": "too crowded.  i do believe we reached the maximum capacity that evening -- quadrupled it at that.  we were like sardines crammed in a can on the dance floor.  the music sucked.  a dj has to know what party music to play to get the crowd hyphed.  i never have understood this crunk hip hop stuff, nor will i ever.  and really, a place that needs a dj to yell at the crowd to wave their bills in the air is just plain out ridiculous.  PROS: __ -calling the hotline got us in for free after midnight -bartender made stiff drinks -the place was really nice...i liked the dark brown color scheme.. very sultry.", "Date": "2007-12-21", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Mariela", "ReviewID": "Xu9ZZdXu4dd0P-RZznN3lg", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Great music, gets very crowded, but awesome atmosphere. make sure you get there before midnight if you're on the list.", "Date": "2013-01-16", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Faith", "ReviewID": "LgIuzQ_tjDI2gXj_ZJKKdQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Had an amazing time!!! Got in for free so that was the first plus. Love the layout and the way the VIP rooms are like individual balconies. The music was great and the people were too.  One complaint... SO many people kept dropping their drinks. If a dance floor is super packed, DON'T bring your drink onto the floor! Come on people!", "Date": "2010-11-09", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
