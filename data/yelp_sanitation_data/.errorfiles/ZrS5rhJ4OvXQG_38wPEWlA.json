A solid 3.5. It wasn't always the best, but it's conveniently located across from UNLV, and it did a good enough job of satisfying your boba cravings.  The last few times I've been here, though, I've noticed a steady downgrade in quality. There was a lot of hit and miss items on the menu beforehand, and the drinks were obviously made with powder. But now, even favorites that I have always ordered didn't taste very good. The almond milk teas and Hokkaido I ordered on my last three visits tasted like straight up water, and the boba was (gasp!) not chewy, but tough and hard and disappointing.   All those visits were at night, so maybe it's just the night shift that's slacking? Or the boba has been sitting too long? And on my last visit, I used a stamp card, so maybe I shouldn't complain because it was free.  I guess I just expected there would be better quality control and the loyalty card, would uh, reward you for your loyalty with something that doesn't taste like water.  Overall, I probably won't be back anytime soon. Considering the disappointing experiences, I'm in no rush to try and fill out another stamp card. Plus one star for the cute decor, but minus three for the terrible boba.", "Date": "2016-10-21", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Brittney-Ashley", "ReviewID": "44gBzT-3B5vuOTYNnEG2fQ", "Overall": "1", "Content": "I got a strawberry milk tea w/ mini boba that tasted horrible and my boyfriend got a tarocado w/ mini boba which was good but the boba was hard.   So I came back in the store with my drink and told the cashier if I could buy another drink since I wasn't satisfied with mine. I ordered the second drink a tarocado w/ regular boba. The guy at the counter got our order wrong and put mini boba instead of regular. My boyfriend goes to the counter tells the guy  my order is wrong, could you fix it?  The other employee then tells us after we bought the drink we didn't have to buy another drink and that could of just switched the drinks out. We asked for the refund and he said he couldn't bc it's already in the system and he didn't want to remake the drink?

Originally, set to open in the fall, Chewy Boba Company has only been open for less than a month. I can honestly say that Chewy Boba Company is tied for the #2 spot on my favorite boba places in town!  Whatever you do, do not underestimate the macarons here because it is primarily a boba shop and they are not made in house.  The macarons are provided by the popular Macaron Cafe in NYC.  At $2.25 a piece or 6 for $12, I would probably get 6 next time. The macarons were made well, chewy, but good. The fillings were awesome and the overall taste is superb. The quality actually surpassed Bottega Louie in DTLA. What?! Shocker right? The creme brûlée macaron was my favorite of the two I ordered. The creamy filling was divine and I enjoyed the bits of caramelized sugar. The candy apple macaron had an good overall apple flavor, but nothing really stood out.   Straight up, tea and milk teas are not this boba shop's forte. They do offer unique drinks and flavor combos that you do not normally see at other boba shops.  This is the only other place in town, besides TapEx to offer mini boba and it's damn good here.   Tarocado - a must try. A perfect blend of taro and avocado with each flavor still prominent and a super smooth consistency. At times, it is a bit sweet. I would recommend less sweet next time.   California dreaming - strawberry, mango, peach slushy.  Matcha green tea slush with red bean topping - reminded me of halo halo! The matcha flavor was good, but the red bean over powered this drink. For a topping, I expected the red bean to be mostly at the bottom, but it looked and tasted blended with the matcha green tea slush. I still prefer KFT's version.   Hazelnut milk tea - love this with mini boba. The only other place that has this combo is TapEx and I am glad that Chewy Boba Company offers this because their service is so much better!   The interior is wow! I love the accents of reclaimed wood, white walls, and graffiti art. Overall, very clean and modern.

I ordered a Thai tea slush. Wasn't really that good. Order two macaroons, those were good. It's pretty expensive here though.  I came here on a recommendation and won't be back. I could try other flavors, but I think Thai tea and milk tea should be on point, they're like the staple of boba. If that isn't good I assume the rest to be lacking.", "Date": "2016-06-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jessica", "ReviewID": "hBoBWT43hCBFgAHesr0Vhw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Heard from some of friends about this place and my boyfriends hates anything boba and chewy but I'm complete opposite. We decide to try something new beside the traditional Thai Tea and I must say the popping pearls and the different flavored are to die for.  Customer service is amazing and  would totally be back here again", "Date": "2016-02-21", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Olga", "ReviewID": "4loL5veWQhlWA-NFUqE-6A", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Great new boba tea place!

Probably the most closest to the sea salt by 85 dregrees i've tried so far. It will be my fav boba place from now on. Great customer service and cozy environment as well. My boyfriend and his mom also tried the avocado & taro milk tea and they loved it. Would definitely recommend with friends and family.", "Date": "2016-06-09", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
