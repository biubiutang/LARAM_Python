The food is great, this is the only Pho place close by and that is somewhat decent. Rare Steak Pho is really delicious when I don't want to drive across time for my favorite place.  The service here is usually awful. I've waited for half an hour for a to go order when I have had people come after me get their order quicker.  I have never dined in, but from the look and the wait I witnessed it wasn't all that great. One time they had a woman who seemed almost completely new trying to work the register by herself and taking 8 minutes to ring up an order, she had to grab a cook's help to finish it out.  The regular guy I see that takes orders can be a bit rude. I've been placed on hold for over ten minutes with him to then have to call back.  I have also ordered to go some Pho and Fried Rice, literally he said 'not a problem, we are out of pho since over half an hour.' How is this not a problem?  I also always order my Pho without bean sprouts, he has questioned me as if why I would ever do such a thing and then time after time there are always bean sprouts.  But yet I keep coming back because it is close and pretty good food.

So, if you're considering going here, but hesitant because of the reviews, I challenge you to try it. You won't regret it.   With that being said, as I pulled up to Jasmine Express, I was a little worried because of the cigar store next door. When I tried Viet Bistro at Tenaya and Lake Mead, it was disgusting because of the cigar smell. But anyways, as I walked in, I was greeted immediately. I ordered a milk tea boba and redeemed my free eggrolls coupon for my Yelp check-in to start. Very prompt service. My boyfriend and I both ordered Pho, as he was not feeling well. I got the rare steak pho. It was absolutely amazing. The flavor was incredible.   I have ZERO complaints about this place. I will definitely be back, sooner rather than later.

Today, the looks and taste of it is totally different. The salt and pepper shrimp that is supposed to be fantastic was very very oily and soggy. The Vietnamese spring roll with shrimp was smelly and yucky, ended up not eating it. The Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce was so over cooked and it was floating in its sauce. The fried rice was dark brown, it was overloaded with soy sauce.  I  complain about it but they did not even offer to exchange it or make a new one. Not even an apology for this AWEFUL meal.

I start off with a lychee green tea no boba. I did not want to fill up on boba. The lychee green tea was delicious! They have lunch specials that end at 4 pm. We got there at 3:30. Just in time. I decided on chicken tempura with fried rice. The chicken tempura was good. Chicken dipped in tempura batter. So juicy and crunchy at the same time. It came with the dipping sauce which tasted like soy sauce. So good. The fried rice was good with some pieces of egg and lots of soy sauce which made the rice tasty. I love some good fried rice!

You can get Chow Mein, Pad Thai, or Pho.   My wife shared a bowl of beef pho with my youngest son. My oldest son got the pork vermicelli bowl. I got the lunch special which came with hot or iced tea, eggflower soup, an eggroll, fried rice, and entr√©e of your choice from a list. I chose sweet n sour pork.   The beef pho was good. Since we ordered it plain, for my youngest, it was just like chicken noodle soup but with beef instead. The vermicelli was ok. Nothing to rave about. Now my lunch special was pretty good. They give you a nice bowl of eggflower soup. I chose iced tea for my drink. I think it was jasmine. It was very strong. If you refer to my pic, the fried rice that came with my sweet n sour pork was very good. The eggroll I think was a combination pork and vegetable. I would say it was a good deal for 6 bucks.  Service was ok. We were taken care of by one server. Even though the place was a bit busy, we got our food in a timely manner. It just took a while to get our refills a couple times.  Some random info: 2 free eggrolls on check in. Free wifi. Password is express7. Lunch specials are everyday from 11 am to 4 pm. Don't forget about the various boba drinks you can order. Apparently a lot of people come here just for those drinks! When we were eating our meal, at least 4 people came in just for those drinks alone! So it must be good. Next time we will try one.

No.  I sat down at one of their sticky and nasty table then they yelled out  you write review?

I am done with their trashy and unprofessional employees.   FOOD/DRINKS I don't know what their vegetable eggroll was made out of but it was inedible. Straight to trash.   Boba milk tea? or did they mistake this for sugar milk tea? perhaps they added a whole bag of sugar in my 24oz milk tea because I didn't write a review? Either way, I could not drink this. I went home, dumped half of the milk tea, added water and I was finally able to drink this. Took a sip then went straight to trash.  Boba was a disgusting mush and had absolutely no flavor or chew.

Whenever I'd have a craving for pho or boba this would be MY spot to go. Especially since it is closer to my house than having to drive all the way to China Town.   I came here a couple days ago with my family. My dad likes their duck here so we tried calling a half hour in advance to place an order. My mom was put on hold for a few minutes but the entire conversation we could hear between the man and his customer. She ended up hanging up and we couldn't connect back with the restaurant for at least 20 mins. By that time we had already arrived in front of the restaurant. We ordered the food via phone still. We did a little food shopping because we were told our food would be about a 20 min wait. Once time had passed and we sat at our table, we actually had to wait about another 20 mins for our food. We had ordered half a duck, Hong Kong noodles w/chicken, General Tso's chicken and a Special Combination Pho, and only water for each of us. We were never asked if we wanted refills on our water once we had first sat down and other than when our meals were given to us he never came back to check on us. I don't understand why it would take so long. Other times I've been here my food would be out 10-15 mins after ordering. I wonder where the the waiter Eddie is? He was always great with his customer service and was always very attentive. Now the people here don't even say hi or greet you. The food wasn't very hot when brought to us but it was good.   I came back to this restaurant today because I've been on this teriyaki chicken bowl or bbq beef feen for awhile so I thought why not try the special that they advertise on the window. The combo includes teriyaki chicken with veggies, rice, crab rangoons and a milk tea. I ordered that and made the milk tea a honey dew. I wish he had asked if I wanted to replace the regular milk tea with honey dew when I ordered cuz it was an extra $3.75. So I got a milk tea with the meal and an extra Honey Dew milk tea. I thought I could choose the flavor for some reason, my mistake. I ordered chicken fried rice also because it's Monday and it's on special. I've always liked their chicken fried rice anyway. I ordered for take out. It took 10 mins for my two drinks to be brought out to me and half an hour to get my food. Mind you it was only two items. He didn't even say anything when he gave me my food. No... Have a nice day  or Thank You!  Disappointing.   The bowl itself was ok, chicken was a bit salty. A lot of rice, not enough chicken, veggies or sauce. I personally don't like my teriyaki bowls to be drenched in sauce anyway but this needed a bit more to it. The fried rice was good as usual though. The Honeydew milk tea tasted a little weird but that might be because I'm not used to it but the regular milk tea was good.   I'm not usually disappointed but the food quality has gone down some and the customer service isn't what it used to be.   I'm not going to say I won't be dining here but I'm not going to go here as my first choice anymore.", "Date": "2015-05-11", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Avery", "ReviewID": "eEYg_cArUMQ74LHwqk3k9g", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I stumbled upon this location when my gf was under the weather and needed some hot pho to help her feel better. Its a small hole-in-the-wall place right in between Vons and Subway. As I entered in I was greeted by the only server there, Chris. As I was going through the menu for take-out (which is really nice because most of the dishes have pictures) I was noticing Chris' customer service and he was well knowledgeable and very customer friendly. I ordered the Plain noodle pho, Pan fry beef vermicelli, and special combo rice plate which came with 3 eggrolls, shrimp, and grilled pork. Now before I tell you how bomb the food was, I must pause for a little constructive criticism. If you plan on doing a take-out, call in AT LEAST 15-20 min before hand. I seriously waited for 30-35 minutes while sitting down with my back against the glass entrance wall where the waiting seats are with the Sun beaming on my back. A lady to the right of me that came in a little later than I asked me if I called in before or placed an order when I came in because she said she called in 20 min before and has been waiting for 45 MIN - AN HOUR. -which is ridiculous for any restaurant especially when there's very little ppl. Did I mention the sun is beaming down on our backs? I knew I should have gotten that thai tea...lol. The lady also said that the total ambiance of the place changed but the food was always good.

The Food was actually fresh! -Definitely something you want when ordering from an oriental/asian restaurant with all the seafood and vegetables they utilize.   Great/Fresh food.

The sweet n' sour chicken was good, but they should consider putting the sauce on the side when doing delivery. It was very soggy, so I ended up pulling off the outsides and just eating the middle.  The lo mein would've been good -- the chicken in it was white meat and cooked well - but the noodles were way overcooked (again, likely due to the delivery time), so they were mush. And I though it was a little bland.  The pork wontons I really liked. My boyfriend didn't like them as much because he really likes those kinds that are just a big fried noodle with a tiny dot of meat in the middle. These have more meat, but are still quite good, in my opinion.  The crab rangoon was... average. Cooked well, tasted fine. I'd order those again, but they weren't a stand-out, really.

They're a Vietnamese, Chinese, Thai fusion type of place which makes ordering off the menu for delivery a little trying at best. I ordered steamed pork buns and I had envisioned the flaky bbq pork buns I've had at dim sum. These are not those buns. They're a bit more pasty and chewy in texture. I was a bit disappointed in that.  Their shrimp spring rolls are quite fresh and vibrant served with a side of peanut sauce. I find it a refreshingly light fair for the hot Vegas summers. Their fried rice could use some more flavor although it is already dark brown from the soy sauce but needing a kick of some sort. My order of General's chicken was extremely mild but on the upside it was overly breaded. It was nice big bites of chicken with very little breading. I'll just have to ask for it a bit spicier than I had ordered.  JE's vegetable egg rolls were nice and crispy. Mongolian beef was a good portion and tender.

This was my 4th time eating here and quite possibly my last.   First, I ordered the speciality fried rice (The server described it as  the white fried rice and not the dark ) It came with chopped pork, chicken and whole shrimp. The shrimp had their intestinal tracks still intact. The chicken was really dry which makes me think they used old leftover pre cooked chicken. And the rice was hard and some pieces were crunchy. When fried rice gets stuck in my teeth, it's not good fried rice.   I also ordered the rare beef Pho. When the server brought the plate of Jalapenos, bean sprouts, and thai basil, the jalapenos were dry and rotting, the basil came wilted and had a lot of brown spots. I asked her to change it out and she did.   Usually whenever I get Pho, it comes steaming hot. Since I only saw little puff of steam, I knew I was in trouble. I went to stir it and the noodles on the bottom were still clumped together, and a small ice cube was in the noodles! I pulled it out and kept stirring the Pho to loosen the noodles. Usually when I get the rare beef, the soup cooks it because its so hot. Not this time... After I tasted it, I called the server over and asked her if she could warm it up in the microwave because it was luke warm. After 15 mins, the little old lady in the back came out with the Pho and said that if I order rare beef it will stay rare. I told her that was fine, but I didnt want cold soup.   When I got the Pho back, I could tell she just boiled the hell out of it because it was full of floaters from the cooked blood from the rare beef. It just looked disgusting. I couldnt eat it, and asked for my check. Instead of making things better, the server just gave me the check and I paid 25.00 for NOTHING. (I did drink my Thai tea)    There was a total lack of service. There was only one other person during my entire visit. Nobody ever really checked on my table. And it was hard to get the servers attention when I needed something.   I am really surprised at the quality of the food, because their sister restaurant Da Lat is outstanding.

To me their food tastes better than other offerings in the area. I like how Roger T. describes their menu as a mix between Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese. I gave four stars instead of five because when I went in to pick up my phone ordered food, the counter person chose to clear tables in an empty restaurant first and had me wait till he was done before ringing up my food which was sitting on the counter waiting for me.

Jasmine Express is an Asian fusion restaurant located off Ann & Camino Al Norte in the large Smith's shopping center. So why the update? Jasmine's vegetarian pho ($7.65) nursed me back to health (I may be exaggerating) when I was sick with a persistent cold. When I find myself eating solo for dinner, I get huge portions of take-out food with a 5-7 minute wait time here. Plus, how awesome is that Yelp check-in offer for two free egg rolls with any purchase? I love those vegetable egg rolls!   Most importantly, ever since I've discovered Boba and Thai Tea, Jasmine Express has been instrumental in catering to my addictions. They're open until 10PM most days, which is the latest Boba shop you'll find open around these parts. They have a huge drink menu with tons of choices and varieties. My husband and I have tried the Thai Tea ($3.75), Taro Smoothie ($.4.25), and Mocha Tea Smoothie ($4.25). That mocha tea was unbelievably good! I've been feigning to try their mint chocolate smoothie next.    Heads up though - customer service needs some major improvements. Just know that before coming in. They're not very knowledgeable on menu items and don't speak much. I wouldn't recommend dining in because service is slow and it tends to be very warm inside. It's very take it or leave it.

Ordered quite a variety so we could get a feel for the place, plus we were STARVING:  -Vegetable eggrolls- very greasy, not unusual for eggrolls so *shrug*  -salt and pepper wings- deep fried and super tiny, like pigeon-wing tiny. Nothing special about them whatsoever...and considering how long it took before we got our order, they were pretty stale on arrival  -hot and sour soup- it was so  gelatin-y  and didn't taste good. I ve had better at the walk-up places at mall food courts. I poured it out  -Pad Thai- just tasteless and dry  -Cashew Chicken- another  gelatin-y  dish. Nothing to  write home about  even if I write about it on Yelp :)   -BBQ fried rice- looked like it was cooked in a really dirty wok, and it didn't taste good either. Tasted like old grease with chunks of dried-up pork in it  We spent a good 50.00, but regretted it. Would've done better to just get up off the couch and drive to Panda, considering the poor quality JE gave us  I doubt seriously that I would eat there (or from there) again and, not to be mean, but I wouldn't tell anyone I know to eat there either.", "Date": "2012-11-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Daniela", "ReviewID": "p8lFMi_L-9MSMJIGZKX4MA", "Overall": "2", "Content": "It is ridiculous how long you have to wait for a chicken teriyaki bowl ...

I'm not big fan of Chinese food but this place changed my perception for the better. The lunch special that they have is really cheaper and you get a lot of bang for your buck. Depending on what main entr√©e you get it can range from $6.00 per plate to about $12.00, the meal includes soup of the day, the entr√©e, egg roll, and a huge helping of their amazing fried rice and the best part it actually comes with either iced/hot green tea with free refills. I personally like the basil chicken, it was large pieces of chicken as well as fresh vegetables.   I've tired many pho places and Jasmine Express has a legit broth which as you probably know with pho is a key element in the pho. I found it to be flavorful and I enjoyed every bite.", "Date": "2013-11-26", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ruben", "ReviewID": "VxoteKwLW4HIdNxhMjhgsg", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Meh. I've experienced better.  Here lies my meager attempt to find some good pho.  I can't go too long without some, and strangely enough, it seems to be a rarity near me.  They seem to specialize in Chinese food, but all I was interested in was the Vietnamese.  Hard to screw up pho for me.  All it needs is the right ingredients and just take a hot minute to get to me.  I'll probably blame the usual clientele for the limited pho selection, but I have also seen worse.  This is the first time I've seen tendon pho all by itself; usually it's along side tripe and other meats.  This could have been very disappointing as I don't typically see a lot of tendon in pho, but no, they were generous here.  On the other hand, for an establishment that prides itself on fresh ingredients (even says so on the menu), their condiments were far from such.  The lime, basil, and sprouts looked far older than I cared to guess.  I drowned them in the hot broth before I decided they might be unappetizing -- except the sprouts as they were just too far gone.  Maybe if they hadn't called so much attention to their ingredients, I would have been more lenient.  Noodles and broth were sufficient in quantity and quality.  Here's a little story: I had a tad too much sun earlier that day and was quite burnt.  I know: strange that I would want hot pho after being sunburnt, but I just had to have it.  They had the plus of being an all Asian staff; I almost prefer it when there was a language barrier to overcome -- typically a sign of authenticity.  And I found some of that with the waitress.  Now there was one exchange that I just wasn't understanding, but after a bit of back-and-forth, turns out she was asking me if I was drunk because of my red face.  While funny at the moment, it sadly once again made me think of what kind of clientele they have to put up with to require that kind of question.  At least she was nice about it.  Another interesting note was the television had a soccer game on in Spanish.  This was a first for me in an Asian establishment, and I'll have to be forgiven for asking about it.  Turns out the owner himself likes it and speaks it.  Supposedly the regulars expect nothing less.  It was these experiences more than the pho that might make me return.", "Date": "2012-04-23", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jason", "ReviewID": "IiSKdMcF9huLVFM1E1OJ_w", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Well Shucks.  I wanted to like the local Chinese joint, but I was underwhelmed two times.  I had the basil chicken.  It just didn't taste very good - I really can't explain it.  The fried rice was real dark with nothing in it.    I can't remember what I got the second time I went... I did see crickets crawling around the floor both times I was there.  This is basically your typical local Chinese restaurant.

My family and I have been coming to this place for years! It seems tho that the restaurant has either changed owners or cook. Today's visit was due to a certificate of $10 I got from restaurants. com. Food was bad last time I came (about a month ago) but I decided to give it another chance. Unfortunately it was worse this time. I Un-wrapped the utensils from the enclosed napkin and got a dirty used fork! My parents orded the Kao pao chicken and i ordered the chicken chow main.  When the food came, the rice was hard like it wasn't even cooked. When I asked for the bill and showed my  restaurants.com certificate for $10, they only creditedy bill for $9.19. When I questioned the amount the server said  Yea, everyone knows that.  Well NO. When you buy a certificate for a certain amount, you expect the business to credit the full advertised amount. Just a bad experience over all. I have I e more $10 certificate left and to be honest, I feel like throwing it away. No sense to going back for bad food And false advertising.", "Date": "2014-07-18", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Lei", "ReviewID": "sJRo13PnIqBJ9g0EUBE9Gw", "Overall": "1", "Content": "the food quality is not consistent. the wait is oh so looooonnnggg, every single time. once, i called in my order and gave them 45 minutes to prepare my food, and when i arrived at the restaurant, i waited another 20 minutes. and while i paid as soon as i got there, i was asked by staff if i had already paid before handing me my food. today will be the last time i set my foot here, because you made me wait again...oh jasmine express, you keep breaking my heart!", "Date": "2012-12-20", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
