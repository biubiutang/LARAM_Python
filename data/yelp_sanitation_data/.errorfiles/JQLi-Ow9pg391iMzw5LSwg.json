Their corned beef hash is the best in town.  It's homemade.  Their jams are also homemade and very yummy.  I've been going here for years and the owners are just the sweetest things.  It's a cozy family restaurant and you can taste the love in their corned beef and homemade jams.    I do agree with some of the other reviewers regarding service.  It's a hit or miss.  It really depends if they are busy or not.  But don't let it discourage you from going.  This is place is a total find.

Came here for breakfast on a Friday morning with my family.  Walked in and the place was busy.     Seat yourself  sign was up so that is what we did.  The counter was full of people watching the tv, the front room was busy and since we had a party of 7, we had no choice but to go to the adjacent room.  DISGUSTING...we walked into the room and noticed a man sitting at a table and no one else; and that could be because all the tables in that room were dirty except for two tables that we managed to move together to accommodate our party of 7.  I looked at the clock and it was 9:50 when we sat down.  My son asked if he could stand by the doorway to watch tv, so I let him.  10:10, no one has come to our table to take our order.  However, the one server did manage to yell at my child when she came into the room to delivery the food to the one man that was sitting at the table next to us.  Again, she walked out of the room without acknowledging us...taking our order or apologizing to my child.  So this restaurant has been here for 20 years?  Really???  Then maybe in those 20 years the owners of this restaurant would have learned that you NEED more than one server and perhaps hire someone to clean the tables as customers leave.    You do know that is a health violation right????

Because they were busy, it took a while for the server to come take our order and it took even longer for the food to come.  I got a typical breakfast with scrabbled eggs, bacon and toast.  The best part of the meal was home made jams.  They bring around a tray of several different selections and let you choose, but you get only one choice.   I got a mixed berry and it reminded me of the jams my grandmother had made, rich in color, berry flavor and texture was just right.

Luckily, I speak dry wit, so I found her hilarious!  The menu is simple here, not a huge selection which I don't mind sometimes.

The Roasted Turkey and Avocado Omelet was fluffy and filled with chunks of white meat. Sandwiched in the fold was a white cheese. I am not sure what it was, probably Swiss because it was mild. Besides the two ingredients listed above, three slices of avocado adorned the top. Other than that, it was a bare of anything else. This observation is not a criticism. It is more of a complement, the omelet needed nothing else. Due to how juicy and well seasoned the poultry was the egg dish did not fall flat. All omelets and hash dishes come with two side dishes. Healthy options include cottage cheese and fruit. I got the grits and wheat toast. The former was magnificent with a little butter. The latter had way too much butter. I wish I knew so I could order it dry. The ample amounts of butter made the toast soggy. The two jams I tried were ok. The mixed berry was loose and runny.

A variety of creamers are provided like french vanilla, hazelnut, and irish cream to name a few.  My brother and I split 3 dishes.  The Party Hash consisted of a nice variety of flavors.  The mixture of chicken, corned beef, ham and roast beef all worked well with the mixed veggies.  Some of the jalapeño slices had a real kick!  Fresh jalapeños are used so be warned if your tolerance for spicy food is low!  (4 stars)  The Corned Beef Hash was lacking in the meat department.  Not sure if this was an isolated incident or if that's normal, but the meat was definitely seasoned/cooked nicely!  This comes with your choice of eggs and I went with sunny side up!  Overall, not bad. (3.5 stars)  The Monte Cristo was my favorite dish above all!  The thin sliced ham and turkey is nice and juicy!  Gooey Swiss cheese... that speaks for itself.  This is served inside some sweet homemade bread (mmm... the hint of vanilla) which was fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside!  For any first timers out there, picture French Toast meets Grilled Cheese.  You can approach this beast in 2 ways.  The first way would be to drizzle syrup on top and attack it with a fork/knife.  The second way would be to grab a slice with your hand and dip it into the syrup.  Call me a savage, but the second way should be the only option allowed. (5 stars)  Both plates of hash came with a choice of sides:  Fresh Fruit - I chuckled when I was brought out strawberries and bananas.  Not what I expected when I placed my order, but no complaints here.  Wheat Toast - The homemade bread was delicious!  This was purposely ordered as an excuse to try out the homemade jelly!  Tried the pumpkin and jalapeño which were both fantastic!  So fantastic that I actually bought a jar of both flavors (yes it's made and sold there)!  Homefries - This side was recommended by the server.  I was expecting french fries, so I was slightly disappointed... wish the server or the menu had provided a description.  My best attempt at describing this dish would be  steamed potato meets hash brown.   Hopefully the picture provided along with this review will help that description.  They were good, but nothing special.  This was my first, but definitely not my last visit.  The staff was very attentive and kind.    P.S.

The wife and I stopped by, and the place was busy. After reading all the awesome reviews here, we were excited to try it....  And after trying it, I started looking for Gordon Ramsay or Robert Irvine to see if they were there trying to save the place.....  We sat ourselves, and within a minute or two, one of the bus boys came over to get our drink order, and he only made one mistake, so, forgivable. We waited about 15 minutes before our server stopped by to tell us she would be there in a few minutes......Ten minutes later she showed up. (unforgivable)  She took our order, we ordered the roast beef hash and the corned beef hash. One with home fries, the other with hash-browns. The order came with two eggs each. My wife ordered over easy, and I ordered over medium. Hers eggs were perfect, mine, the yolks were nearly hard.  Now let's talk about the potatoes, her hash-browns were not seasoned, were barely cooked, and were very greasy. My home-fries, were abysmal. They were still raw in places, and again, zero seasoning, and lots o grease.  Hash...the raison d'etre for this place...I have one word, disgusting. The roast beef....more like where's the beef? It looked and tasted like overcooked ground beef, not even the good stuff, no flavor other than grease, and again, I point out, over cooked.Where is the seasoning?  The Corned beef, people from the emerald isle would weep over how bad this was. It was DRIED OUT, and it looked and tasted like it was the last of what was left that was scraped together and dumped on a plate. No seasoning, and there was almost no meat in it at all.  At this point, our waitress came back and asked us how everything was and my wife told her it was horrible. Giving credit where credit is due, she did offer us the change to replace the food with something else. Here is where my wife once again proved she is smarter than I, she said no. I ordered a cheese burger. After the debacle with the hash-browns and home-fries, I declined french fries and asked for coleslaw.  About 15 minutes later, my burger arrived. It was cooked as ordered, but there is where the positivism ends. There was ZERO flavor or seasoning on the burger, and it was greasy as hell.The coleslaw was so sweet, I could only eat one bite.  After all was said and done, the only thing they charged me for was the burger and two cups of coffee. So I do give them credit for that, but the food was lousy and we won't be back.  Note: I did not mention the side of fruit my wife ordered that came with bruised strawberries.... Note II: When we arrived and we were waiting for our food, we noticed a lot of people leaving a lot of food behind, before trying to eat, we thought it was because of portion sizes, nope...Portion sizes are ok, food is just bad.", "Date": "2015-11-03", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Kyle", "ReviewID": "wLw-HI7KKS3MBayrtYYv1Q", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Service was a little slow.

Hidden away in a corner of the shopping mall near Decatur and Sahara, one would almost miss it if they weren't already trying to track it down.  As the restaurant is only open till 2pm, if you take too long to find it, you won't make it in time.  When we entered the restaurant, we found our table and the waitress dropped off the menu's without asking us if we'd like something to drink.  This would be understandable if it was slammed in the restaurant.  We were one of two or three tables occupied, however, so this with the fact that it took her another 10-15 minutes to return diminished our hopes of an enjoyable meal.  I am one to believe that a restaurant should not be entirely judged on one particular meal alone.  Much like Lotus of Siam, where it is said the Northern Menu is what the restaurant is best known for, the Hash here is supposed to be excellent.  I, however, am not a big fan of hash so I chose to not eat it (as well it was lunch).  The food that we did order (the Peasant Lunch was my choice) was decent but again, a bowl of chili, plain toast and a small cup of strawberries and banana's did not seem to be worth $6.99.  Between the two Hash House moniker's, I would recommend A-Go-Go.  Forget about the looks of either place...at A-Go-Go, the food is better all around (I don't have to limit myself to one particular type of food) and the portions are huge.  If I want a small, decently cooked home-made meal, I'll go to the 50's Diner on Jones near the 215 or Black Bear Diner on Jones and Tropicana.

Friend #1: Corned Beef Hash ($7.95) - served w/hash browns and an english muffin, this potatoey, oniony hash had crispy bits of meat in it.  It was not as meaty as we expected - they could stand to bump up the ratio of meat to potatoes & onions.  Biscuits & Gravy ($7.25) - served w/2 eggs and nicely crisped bacon, these b&gs were yummy!  Still crispy edged yet fluffy under the gravy.  To share: Blueberry Pancakes, short stack ($3.50) - super blueberry-y, not overly sweet, really good!  After the food came out, our efficient server brought a tray of house made jams and jellies for us.  They sparkled like multi-colored gems!

There were MANY empty tables yet the first thing our server told us was how busy it was. We looked around very confused, but whatever maybe they were short staffed.

Once we got the coffee I had to wait another 5 mins for the milk for the coffee. I finally gave up and went to the counter to get the milk. My server appeared to have forgotten.

Getting a refill on coffee was literally like pulling teeth. We noticed the two (yes only two) other tables that were occupied commenting on how long it was taking, that they were just going to leave and so on. We were hungry so we stayed. After waiting a significant time one of my friends asked our server if our food would be out soon. Honest to goodness she looked like she either didn't know what we were talking about or was put off by us asking. She replied,  Oh, I don't know. I will go see.  I am sorry...what?????  After she  went to go see  our food was brought out not 5 mins later. It wasn't super hot so maybe it had been sitting there...I don't know. Anyways, the food was just as good as I remembered.

Hash House a Go Go is another 2 miles up on Sahara, turn right when you start getting the smell of wasted food and rosemary branches from the ridiculously large servings they shovel at you there.  With that out of the way, this place is great.  I'm here almost every Sunday for breakfast.  This is the kind of place I would want to hang out if I lived in a small town.  It's almost out of place in the strip mall, and would seem a lot more at home on Main Street in some city famous for the world's largest collection of rubber bands, or the track team winning the class AA title for the last 4 years running.  None of the glasses, coffee mugs, forks, knives, plates...anything matches.  You can tell it's all a mishmash group of utensils and china that has been picked up when prices are good.  I think it's great.  The food is outstanding.  It's hard to decide many Sundays what the best thing to get is.  I usually stick with the Party Hash, which is a mix of the Corned Beef/Turkey/Roast Beef/something else Hash.  It's by far the best hash I've ever had.  I've been eating it on a regular basis for six years.  When I'm up for something different, the triple decker sandwiches never disappoint.    I won't go line by line of the menu, I'll just say.  I've been coming here forever and have never left disappointed.  Two of my favorites that would suggest to all first timers.  #1: The Sausage Patty.  The Homemade sausage is perfect.  For people like myself that don't enjoy sweets and would much rather follow up a steak dinner with another steak than a piece of chocolate cake, this is as close to heaven as you get.  Even if you just like sausage a little bit, get the sausage.  #2: Homemade Jelly.  She always does something special, but my favorite has been the Sangria Jelly.  At the same time she did Sangria there was a Tequila Sunrise Jelly as well.  Both were awesome, both will be missed.  The basics are always awesome as well, Strawberry is my go to jelly.  I would probably inject it into my vein, given the chance.  Get toast, just to try the jelly.  Short story:  This place is great.  The service is what I would expect out of a diner-like establishment.  Sometimes is gets a little busy with theafter church/baseball tournament crowd.  However, Darlene is always great, and always fun to talk to.  Same with Mary, the owner, always friendly and available to help.

It was pretty good.  Had a little bit of butter flavor, which I generally don't like, but the overall flavor of the omelet was decent.  The olives and jalapenos in there were very good.  I shared the omelet and was still full.  It came with a choice of 2 sides; I went with cottage cheese and hash browns. The hash browns were standard; I enjoyed them.  I thought the portions were pretty good.    The coffee was also decent.  It was good enough that I could drink it black.  There were also free refills on the coffee, which I certainly took advantage of.    They had several homemade sauces that I thought were notable.  The habanero sauce had a good flavor, and was kind of sweet and interesting.  The chipotle had a usual smoky flavor (I like the habanero sauce better).  They also had a really interesting spicy ketchup, but by the time I tried it I had so many hot sauces that my mouth was on fire, and I couldn't really notice the spiciness of the ketchup.  My friends ordered the corned beef hash and enjoyed it.  This place also has an impressive variety of homemade jam, desserts, and dog treats for sale.  I didn't get a chance to try all of it, but I thought it was rather neat.  I really like the cozy, quirky, homemade mom and pop feel here.

The entre was about $10.95, which is a great deal for breakfast - especially for two people. The portions are definitely large enough to share with a friend.

I'm a big fan of Benedicts so of course I was eager to try this.  The restaurant is situated in a plaza that doesn't seem populated much.  I actually passed it while trying to find it.  The place is outdated and we literally sat on a folding picnic table since there was 6 of us.  Not sure why they couldn't push 2 four seater tables together.  I ordered the lobster benne with hash browns on the side.  My son had a short stack.  My sister decided to try some salmon dish for the first time with a side of their special white toast.  Apparent their white toast melts in your mouth.  This place also makes their own jams.  The waitress came out with a tray full of the different jams (pineapple, jalapeño, watermelon, apricot, grape and strawberry).  You can try as many as you like.  The food eventually came out and I must say the presentation was visually appealing.  After a few bits in, it seemed to get bland.  I added pepper since I never add salt to my food.. But that didn't solve it. The hollandaise sauce was bland.  I slowly gravitated to the lobster only and left behind the biscuit and sauce.  The hash browns were ordinary.  I did try the white toast with the grape jam and that was delicious.  Overall, it's ok..

A fan of chopped I figure it'd be worth a try. As we entered on Friday at 1pm, we were surprised by the lack of crowd. Three table of patrons.  We read the sign after dumbly standing there for a minute or two without anyone greeting us and we seated ourselves. Looking around we saw many tables with dishes not bused. We sat. And sat. And sat. No one came to greet us. The one and only server finally came and took order from a nearby table. Did not acknowledge us. We are a table of 7... Luckily I had time on my hands so I read more reviews. On one of them a reviewer mentioned  the egg and I   nearby. We walked out without a goodbye.  We were famished. Luckily the egg and I seemed close by. Keep in mind this was a spur of the moment decision. Triggered by the lack of service at our original destination. We arrive at egg and was greeted by a smiley hostess. The place was crowded. We informed her we wouldn't mind two tables of four. She smiled and said she has just the space for us. They pushed two tables together and made us a space by the booths.  Service was prompt. Our waitress introduced herself as Jackie. The food was delicious.  bottom line is the reviews seem to give the food good remarks. However we were turned off by the lack of service and never made it to the food part.  Even if the food was five star worthy, the overall experience would have netted 3 stars at best. Being a small business owner myself, my constructive criticism for the owner would be to over staff part timers so short staffing does not ruin the reputation of the establishment.

Long story: Not knowing any better, I figured we would give Hash House a try given the 1 hr wait at the HHAGG. Big mistake.   Walking through the door, I get the feeling this is my kind of place--  homey, seat yourself, etc. (In reality, it was actually like stopping for breakfast at my ex-mother-in-law's house after I ran over her cat. But I really don't have an ex-mother-in-law nor did I run over her cat.)  But back to breakfast-- after we seat ourselves, we wait 5 minutes before we are handed menus. (Were we supposed to grab them ourselves, I wonder? Possible faux pas which I will own.) But I think the icy stare from the owner/waitress was unnecessary and you could have asked for our beverage order...or just greeted us...anything.   Coffee seems to take forever to arrive, and while we are waiting to order, I realize that the folks at two other tables have been/are still waiting for their food. (I thought folks were wrapping up their meal, but the fatigue on their faces was not from being overstuffed, it was from malnourishment.)  Now, based on other reviews, you might think that we were here on a particularly busy morning or something. Something, anything rational to explain the long wait for food. No, I think it has to do with a kitchen staff (actually I only saw 1 guy) who is not a short order cook. It looked like he was preparing 1 plate at a time...and slowly.  I order the corned beef hash, my wife picks the salmon and eggs. (She admitted she was delusional.) While the hash may be made to order, it was unremarkable. My wife's salmon was overcooked beyond recognition and yet, her eggs and home fries were cold. We tell our server and ask her to take it off the bill (because my wife will kill someone if she has to wait for something else to come out of the kitchen).   So we get the bill, and surprise, she didn't charge for the salmon. (Reflecting back, I did say that the salmon was overcooked and we didn't want it... I did not say that we don't want to pay for the cold eggs and home fries...what was I thinking.)  OK, so I realize this is your livelihood and you can't just give away food the same way you do at a buffet (or Denny's) but do you see how it might be a bit offensive to charge for the barely edible food on the plate that was not sent back? Like we go around sending food back so we can get a meal comped...   Lesson learned-- never eat here again. Even if the HHAGG has an hour wait.   P.S. I hear HHAGG has a second location in Imperial Palace...

Definitely a hole in the wall diner. Upon arriving, my partner and I noticed dishes piled high against the wall of the bar area, at the tables in the main room, and later, we discovered the same at every empty table in the second dining room that we were seated at. We waited for at least 5 minutes along side two other groups of people for someone to welcome us. I believe it was Mary herself who added us to a waiting list, and told us it would be about 10 minutes before they would be able to clean off a table for us. We watched as the waitstaff wandered around the dirty tables as in a state of confusion, and never saw a dedicated buser the entire time we were there. We had plenty of time to review the menu while waiting at the front, so when we were sat, we ordered everything immediate, in hopes to speed up the process. We were sitting among dirty tables the entire time , which made us feel uneasy, and our order took forever. The food was good, but not great, and with the dirty tables all around us, we didn't feel like we could enjoy our food.

Greatness! - Homemade Jams and Jellies (especially the Apple-Jalapeno), Biscuits & Gravy w/ Homemade Sausage Patty, Triple Decker Turkey Bacon Sourdough Sandwich Just OK - Party Hash (good with Tabasco and still better than  Hash House A Go Go ) Never Again -  Lamb Hash, Veggie Hash, Beef Barley Soup (really really bad...probably as good as canned)", "Date": "2011-06-14", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Rick", "ReviewID": "8GWvMF-vCeWTAk9wcBJC-Q", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Based on an all around review (not just the food), I only gave this amazing place 4 stars.   I'll start with the  not so awesome . The cleanliness of the dining area could be better and the bathroom wasn't that pleasant but the part that got me the most is the seating. It can be a little cramped.   THE FOOD!! I will definitely go to this spot many times for the food. Everything I tried (three dishes) was wonderful.   The main dishe I had was the Argentina eggs Benedict with mariscos (shrimp). The spices they use with the hollandaise sauce goes perfect with the poached eggs and shrimp. I will definitely get that again.   It is a little off the strip but worth the drive.

Four of my family members stormed into this place and sat right down at a table at 10:30am on a Saturday morning. Those of you who don't understand, this is kickass in itself because 10:30 is when hangovers are waking up last night's drunks, and church is getting out. It's a terrible time to try to find food.....  ANYWAY, we all loaded up on coffee and to my delight of my mother, they offered not only decaf and regular, but also BOLD coffee. Nicely done. Downfall....they do not have actual cream for the coffees, only the non-refrigerated half and halfs.  The coffee was great, and then they brought out a cocktail tray of jellies to try. The jalapeño jelly was my favorite, but they had hoards of variety, and they sell them. I forgot to get some on the way out, but they were worthwhile to buy.  I ordered the party hash. Corned beef, ham, jalapeños, bell peppers, and a ton of other stuff that I drowned in the habanero sauce (that's really sweeter than hot), and it was literally one of the best breakfasts that I've eaten......ever (and I'm a huge breakfast fan and frequenter.)  I'd absolutely love to head here again, and I'm pretty sure that I will next time I'm in town.  Fair warning, you guys only have a few more months until I return, so you'd better fix that creamer issue and find some hotter peppers, or you'll be hearing about it.

I often wondered what had become of this wonderful Hash House until I located it on yelp.  There is was...the geographical location had changed but not the delicious chow, I remembered from yesteryear.    The new location offers a much larger dining area with the same waitress from days gone by running around serving hungry eaters.  Be patient with her, the food is worth it, even if the same lady (owner, Mary, I think) is not slaving away on the griddle.  The name of the game is HASH.  There are multiple variations to try.  My favorite is the party hash....not the kind you might be thinking because it would illegal but the edible persuasion.  It's got a little bit of everything, corned beef, roast beef, ham, chicken jalapeños, with mushrooms, all scrambled together.  If your a fan of jelly, they have homemade jelly here.  All sorts of delicious flavors to choose from.  I like the jalapeño flavor is sweet and sassy.  After writing this I am filled with a warm fuzzy and I am going to throw down another star!

When he got back we were all surprised to see that we all didn't get sides!!!! Not one of us.  Now I understand that if it said sides are extra on the menu but no it says  comes with your choice or sides!!! And to make it even more  wtf  my sandwich and my buddies omelette are in one box!!!!! Really  Mary ?!?! So I called and  Mary  answered it ( the reason I put quotations on this is because she said she was Mary the owner but you never know). So I told her that we didn't get any sides.  She replied that's how we ordered it......yes Mary all 3 of us decided we all don't want sides so that we can keep our figures.....OH NO!!! We are hungry boys working morning till night!!! I told her no we ordered 2 fries and one hash.  Her response was,  no you didn't . I also told her that even both my main order and my buddies main order were in the same box. Her response,  that's how you wanted it . Yes of course Mary we wanted our food together so that we can recreate the scene from Lady and the Tramp!!!  So then she just cut me short and ask,  so what do you want ......Excuse me?!?! I told her well cutting your attitude to a customer would be nice.  To which she replied again,  that's how you wanted it, so what do you want?   After that I asked her for her name and she said,  Mary, the owner.  Well Mary the owner.  Thank you for no sides even though you gave us a bottle of ketchup!!!! And thank your for your gracious attitude Mary! You remind me of the character  Mom  from Futurama.

The place was half empty, which should tell you something. We sat ourselves per the sign and grabbed our own menus. After about five minutes someone finally realizes we exist and the waitress takes our order. She greeted us by saying she was glad we were ready because she had a table of fifteen to get to. Okay... well yeah we're ready, we've been sitting here staring at the tiny menu for five minutes. I order and ask what the hash browns are like.  They're shredded.   Okay, are they crispy though?   Yeah,  she says in a huff. My husband orders the waffle special. After a million years, our order comes. My bacon and eggs were okay, not great. The  crispy  hash browns were mostly mush and tasted ENTIRELY of grease. Like no other flavor was present than straight up grease. My husband's teaspoon of eggs and two strips of bacon were also mediocre/okay (I gave him a few of my five slices of bacon). However his waffle was flavorless, served with a tiny shot flavorless syrup. I tried his waffle and couldn't even believe how the slightest hint of waffle flavor disappeared within milliseconds and left me chewing on a wet sponge. At some point while we were eating we were surprised by the sudden appearance of our check on the corner of our table. How did it get there? Did it float in on the breeze? Our waitress was nowhere to be seen. Which was too bad for us because we would have liked more napkins, water, and flavorless syrup. Oh well. I finished my meal by eating my toast with some of the jams, the apple butter was probably the best apple butter I've ever had, truly a star of a jam. That is why I gave 1 star to this place. If you come here you should just buy a jar of jam and leave.   Finally, having never heard from our waitress again (someone nearby flagged her down for napkins which of course caused her to spin around and vanish into thin air), I got up and paid with the check that had been delivered to us by a ghost. To my surprise, there was our waitress talking to the cashier! She was passionately bitching about another customer to the cashier who seemed to try to politely ignore her. The cashier was friendly to me but in no way did I feel bad about leaving a minuscule tip to match the service.   Ignore the good reviews!

The juices come in a plastic bottle, so I am not so much a fan--I prefer fresh squeezed orange juice, or at least concentrate in a glass...

There were several flavors: watermelon, guava, pineapple, raspberry amd strawberry.   I would definitely come back again, if the wait was not as long. You can see that the servers were working really hard and they were always hustling. I would recommend for them to hire 1 or 2 more additional staff members. They definitely need the help.  Overall great food, but not for the person who is on the go, or in a time crunch.

About 10 minute minutes later she came over, put our drinks down in front of us and just looked at us with a pen and pad.  No suggestions, no  what are you having,  she just looked us.  I had to ask her if she was ready, to which she responded with a shrug, as if I was wasting her time.  Mind you there where only 3 other tables with people at them in the whole place.  I should have know at that point that a breakfast joint with 6 other people in it on a Saturday morning was not the place to be.  Food took about 10 minutes, the check was dropped with the food and the server never returned.  We sat there with empty glasses for the rest of the meal.  I had the corned beef hash, my friend had the roast beef hash.  Both were ok, not great by any means but not bad either.  I read a few other reviews that said the hash was great compared to the canned stuff they are used to.  That right there should tell you everything you need to know about the food.  Back to service, the next time I saw our server she went up to the bar counter where they had what looked like cinnamon buns in glass presentation cases.  She opened up the glass presentation cases, and squeezed the buns with her bare hands to check the freshness.  Well I would say after that I had enough.  I wanted to try the  homemade deserts  but no one ever came back to check on us or to see if we needed anything else.  Also, after seeing how the handle the food out front where everyone can see imagine what's going on behind closed doors in the kitchen.

What we ordered:  Raspberry cinnamon roll.  Very good.  Came our hot and had a nice chewy consistency.  Me:  Eggs Mary with grits and rye bread.  The food wasn't that hot considering it took so long to come out.  Rye bread was pretty good with their homemade jam but the jam wasn't that gourmet tasting.  Poached eggs were a bit rubbery.  Grits were a bit too thick and clumpy and luke warm.  Bacon was good though.  Son:  Eggs Mary.  They didn't bring out his sourdough toast but we couldn't be bothered to ask them for it.    Husband: Party hash.  I told him that I really wanted to try the hash as everyone on Yelp was raving on about how good it was which is why he ordered this.  Even before trying it or didn't look like anything that spectacular.  My husband said it wasn't that good but I still had to try it.  It was so so.  Not crispy and a bit bland but a lot of filling.  Disappointed as I was looking forward to good hash.   You would think the food would be hot as it took so long to cone out but it wasn't.

We tried Eggs & I first, but they had a wait time of 25 minutes. I think if we just would've waited there instead, we'd have been much happier.

According to the menu, the chicken is 'garlic-poached', but my husband didn't detect any garlic undertones. 2/5   SERVICE: A white-haired woman with glasses greeted us as we walked in and seated us immediately. She was awesome. An older lady with short brown hair and no personality is what doomed our visit. When taking our food orders she walked up to the table and just stood there, silent. Finally, she mumbled  Need a moment? . We gave her our orders and she scurried away. She didn't interact with us until she brought some food to the table, which wasn't ours. She took the plates away and said  Oh I thought these were yours . Eons later, our food comes. Not once did she return to check up on us or offer refills.

After the hype (which could barely be qualified as  hype,  maybe better described as mild promotion) it was a let-down.  Fresh fruit was some pitiful watermelon cuts and banana slices.  The jelly was VERY good (IMO the best thing about the place).  It was THE only aspect of our entire interaction that the server displayed any modicum of enthusiasm (not that I need some f*in Carrot-Top server, but she was definitely a downer).  In this though, she came to the table with a tray of jelly options and offered it to me for the toast.  It was impressive and delicious =D  Again, that really is the only good thing about the place.

They have friendly service.  It is a simple no fuss mom and pop joint.  Nice quiet place for breakfast.  I always get the corned beef hash.  I like the corned beef hash because it has to be homemade.  This is easily the best corned beef hash I have ever had in Vegas.  They usually do a good job on basting my egg too. The breakfast comes with plenty of food.

I know corned beef hash is an acquired taste but I love the stuff and this place does it best.  I also love all the homemade jams on thick whole wheat toast.   I've had the hotcakes several times as well and they are awesome!   This place is small and does get busy sometimes but have a little patience!  The owner is usually there is friendly and always checks up on my food.", "Date": "2014-09-23", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ken", "ReviewID": "w-R4bUds5VlVX1GlwReRNQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I come here often.
