I recommend ordering their tacos and lobster balls. My husband tried their broth and he really loved it, but it made him full. So if you're looking to experiment, order small items and share them. I really wish they had their own restaurant. I would go all the time. They're the main reason why I visit the Foodie Fest.", "Date": "2014-10-05", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Juddi", "ReviewID": "mEVd2beI-WHS35Sn42AiYA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "This Asian fusion cuisine is amazingly delicious! I've never tasted food like this before! The staff is extremely friendly, price is right and besides who would've thought pho on a food truck would be this delicious! Their food is made to order so it's always fresh. I would say I would give two thumbs up and my face planted in to their food!

The broth was perfect n I didn't even need to add any sauce to it. It was perfect just the way it is. Also tried the lobster balls which was delish. Tried the tuna poke nachos. I can eat those everyday!!! But my fave was the Bau Bun sandwich. O-M-Gee!! That was to die for. :) already craving them n cannot wait til I get to eat some more!!!

The tacos were fantastic, but I didn't feel the pho at all. A bit sweet, the noodles a bit too chewy, minimal lobster and chewy beef. For a $14 (I think) pho, I wasn't impressed. 3 stars thanks to the tacos.", "Date": "2013-10-21", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Rick", "ReviewID": "ZyB98o7pp3lxFtL2UYRIwQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I just tweeted: @LVHelpGro  @wadapho your brisket really is ridiculously #Pho-licious! https://www.facebook.com/rick.passo/posts/735566056470089 ... great meeting you @FirstFridayLV cc @FoodHubLasVegas  Really great ingredients, wonderfully conceived fusion dishes, creative marketing, good people, amazing & fun vibe.

I got two orders of Da Big Baoz ($2.75 ea.) and one Pho-licious Q Slider ($2.75) for lunch. The sirloin in the bao was slightly sweet but the sauce gave it a bit of a kick. Both had plenty of filling. My only gripe is that the buns were a little dried out. The slider was amazing. I loved the chewy pretzel roll and there was plenty of tender brisket falling out the sides and back with every bite.", "Date": "2013-09-22", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jordan", "ReviewID": "7v1d_6CcllEOkABZwVYHrw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "What can I say?

I'm so glad that I did. They know how to do Pho as well as some other Pho(n) stuff (get what I did there?). My hubby and I ordered the delish Pho soup which was the right amount of seasoning and beef flavor. I hate a tart Pho and Wa Da Pho's was perfect. We also ordered the chicken lettuce wrap, Baos, the tofu nachos (yummy) and my favorite of the evening- the Ahi Poki Nachos! They are out of this world. I would seriously follow this food truck to eat the Poki nachos everyday. The only thing I was disappointed about was that they ran out of the Lobster balls but I was there at the Foodie Festival on the last day 2 hours before the place was closing so I can't blame them on that. I'll just have to get them next time. I also liked that the truck was super sleek and the service was on point. I couldn't believe they just launched at the Foodie Fest. These people know what they are doing. They also are on punch card / frequent buyer app called Epoxy where if you download you can get punches for each meal you order and the 10th entree is free. Pretty sweet deal for great food!", "Date": "2013-04-30", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Autumn", "ReviewID": "NZdVAMnh-CLYwIkbLwCfDA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Try the Pho li cious Brisket Tacos!

So all morning I was all excited about going to Rollin Smoke BBQ for lunch and here pulls up the Wa Da Pho food truck outside my window at work. It was closer to walk to the food truck than my car. I had both Rollin Smoke BBQ and Wa Da Pho bookmarked for a while and wanted to try both equally as bad as the other. Talk about a food c-block, f-block.  Well since Wa Da Pho usually isn't out there, a regular food truck and occasionally a good food truck is parked there, I had to go for some. For lunch they have a  da pho box lunch special .  Choosing 2 of 5 items and a drink or a dessert and chips for about $9. I went off of the pictures on their food truck since everything looked good, didn't read the food descriptions usually the best way for me to do things.   The first item I chose was the  da lobsta ballz  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wa-da-pho-las-vegas?select=ggcqbQoGku7B-hmsjahGWg#ggcqbQoGku7B-hmsjahGWg I enjoyed most of it.  The outsides tasted very delicious. The insides however was meh, it tasted exactly like imitation lobster which is what the menu exactly said after I read it, lightly fried imitation lobster balls served with 'da' sauce spiced with their special blend of seasonings. I did no care for the insides because it was mushy like when you use too much water when you cook a pot of rice and try to salvage it. I know some people who like this kind of mushiness so maybe it suppose to be like this, which is fine.    The second item was the  pho-licious 'Q' slider  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wa-da-pho-las-vegas?select=ggcqbQoGku7B-hmsjahGWg#FPBIQcO1L4JkJRqleDeUKg it tasted like eating a pho in a slider with more. It was a pretzel slider bun with BBQ pho brisket, papaya slaw, cabbage, cilantro and their 'wa' sauce. It was good again but I didn't really enjoy the pho meat part maybe because I always dump sriracha and hoisin into my pho. I'd ask for more sauce next time or even some of that 'da' sauce from da lobsta ballz. The chips and cinna-bao dessert were enjoyable.  I sampled some of the  pho-licious 'Q' nachos and they were very good, nice sized but a little small for the price.  It was lightly fried wonton chips with pho 'Q' brisket (wow they actually call it that haha), cilantro, green onion, melted big eye swiss cheese topped off with a splash of 'da' sauce. Enjoyed them the most.  I'm a fan of their organization and effort in making things easy and standing out, logos on food boxes and containers, order numbering and receipt system, friendliness, etc. Follow them on Facebook and Twitter to know where they at.", "Date": "2013-08-05", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
