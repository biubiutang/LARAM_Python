Ever!  My wife and I do fried chicken maybe once a month and she asked me to try churchs.   This happened on 02/25/10  This location is small. You can see everything happening in the kitchen. I arrived about 8:30 and went to order. The kid working the register was sweating quite a lot. He also had bad larynghitis (could hardly talk) which happens when you are sick and your throat swells and presses on your vocal chords, it happens to me every winter.  So I order. He has problems hearing me and I am not a quiet person. He can't hear me. Guess his head cold has his ears congested.   After that I watch him go back into the kitchen (you can see everything) and right next to the chicken... AHH-CHOO! and he sneezes into his HAND and then wipes his NOSE in his shirt...!  I called the manager over and demanded my money back right away. She asked in Spanish to herself  oh, porque?  ( oh, why? ) and I answered  porque? Because your employee is sick and just sneezed and wiped his nose on his shirt! It's disgusting is why!   she answered with  well he's no touching the food...    I swear to God this really happened. Absolutely horrifying. I am calling the head office of this company this week and maybe even the Clark county health department.", "Date": "2010-02-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Rob", "ReviewID": "QVzP3yfBXihHwkhKX-P9zQ", "Overall": "3", "Content": "I came by this location right before closing time to order a bunch of fried chicken for my friends.

Definition of comfort food.  Ok so I am not a big fan of fast food, and though I looove chicken fingers I am kinda picky about em (no thanks KFC). But Church's is one of those exceptions.Their chicken fingers are awesome because they come in spicy and traditional yay! They are long and covered with yummy crispy batter. On top of that, they have of my all time favorite foods: cheese bombers. Deep fried cheese and jalapeno filled fritters mmm.  Yeah so if your on a diet jus stay far away.  Unfortunately for whatever, reason all the Church's in town (with the exception of rainbow/robindale location) are all extremely run down looking. I don't know why but it seems like the owners do not spend any money on upkeep.

I'm sorry you said ten minutes for spicy I order original and then you ran out and tell me ten minutes like 20 ago. Other people behind me getting chicken before me.

When in Chinatown, grab Asian food right? Ummmm....how's about some Church's?....as in Church's Fried Chicken?!?!? Yup, why not???  Having only recently discovered Church's, We stopped by this location to see if it was just as good as our last visit at another location. Got a 2 piece original meal with 2 sides and a drink for $5.99...Not bad for a chicken chain! You would have definitely spent double the amount at a soul food joint.  We had two different people help us, and they were both very courteous and helpful regardless of how slammed they were at the moment inside the restaurant AND drive thru! Church's always has a wait for fried chicken, and it was a 15 minute wait this time. I've never seen it this busy at Popeye's, Jolibee, or even at  Colonel Sanders' place! Always crispy, hot, and juicy, their chicken doesn't disappoint and neither do the biscuits...can't get softer, fluffy biscuits anywhere else...sides are okay but its all about the chicken, biscuits, and sweet tea here!   Next time you're in Chinatown and not feelin' Chinesey, Japanesey, Vietnamesey, or any other type of Asian persuasion, Go get yourself some fried chicken goodness from Church's!   ALOHA!!!

So why the two stars?  Service was WHACK. I know I'm not coming here to get fine dining service but damn, can a girl get some hot sauce and ketchup? My boyfriend and I came here and got 10pc bucket, some biscuits, and a side of coleslaw. When we had questions while ordering (prices, etc.), all the guy who took our order would do was point to the menu and shake his head. I swear, I did not hear his voice at all until he announced the total price.   Although we got the order pretty quickly, NOT ONLY did they not ask us if we wanted the chicken original or spicy, they also didn't ask if we wanted condiments, napkins, or even a fork for the coleslaw! They might as well should've left out the top and straw for my drink too! It took us at least 15 minutes to get it. I think these problems could have easily been avoided if there were a station set up already with that stuff, but then again the place is also pretty small.  If those biscuits weren't ON POINT, I would've given this place 1 star.

I prefer Church's over KFC and Popeye's. The biscuits here are amazing. They have a sweet glaze brushed over the tops of them. Best biscuits ever. Now for the star of the show, the chicken. You can choose spicy or regular flavored chicken. I always get spicy, because it's not very spicy. They always have a special going on and right now it's 2 pieces of chicken and 2 small sides for $2.99.   I was really hungry, so I ordered a combo with 3 pieces of chicken, a side (coleslaw), and a drink and it was just under $7. I waited about 5 minutes and my food came out. Everything was good. The chicken was crispy and hot. The slaw is mayo based and has a nice tang. I also like the jalapeño poppers and Mac and cheese. They have other offerings like chicken sandwiches and I think fried shrimp, but I haven't tried those items.   The downside is that this particular location is very small, and gets cramped quickly. When you walk through the front door, the counter is right there just a few feet away. Most of the time they are busy so it gets very cramped when more than 5 people are waiting in line to order or waiting to pick up their food. This location also has a drive thru, but it is also small and cramped so beware. It is very hard to get in and out of this parking lot.

I finally get my food and take off cuz I'm now late getting back to work.  I turn out of the driveway and mash potatoes spill all over my seat!! I asked for fries!!! So I get to work and call the store back I ask for a manager and the guy in the phone says there won't be a manager there until tomorrow afternoon. This was at 2pm by the way. The guy said his name was Joe and he would be in tomorrow. So I go there today at like 12ish and I go inside and wtf Joe is there sayin he remembers me from the phone convo. The odd part his his name tag says General Manager on it!! WTF!! Then instead of replacing my order for the inconvenience I had to go thru, he tries to hand me some burnt ass fries.

Church's chicken is the closest I'll get to being religious and this will be the only church i will voluntarily go to even tho all i do here is sin and pig out. I honestly think you could blind fold a food critic, feed them Church's chicken, and they might think it was cooked by Jose Andres. They might also think I'm being a little dramatic.   Keep an eye out for their posters to see what special deals they have going on! Last time I was here I got two sides, a biscuit, and two pieces of chicken for $4.44 I believe? DANK.  Oh, and their biscuits will probably make you drool enough to cure the California drought.  The line may be long and move kinda slowly but that's because right when you order, they will give you your food before helping the next customer in line.
