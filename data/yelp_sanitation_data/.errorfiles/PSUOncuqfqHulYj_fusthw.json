The owner never fails to stop by the table for a quick hello whenever he's there and is always interested in feedback.

I've eaten here more than enough times to catch every shift change, every waitress and every cook and all that I can say is that these cheeburgers are heaven sent. Some of these other reviews mention slow service, and  less than exceptional food. I must defend my favorite burger place by saying that the  slow service   is to blame on your fresh not frozen made-to-order meat. If you go back to the cook's line, I guarantee you're not going to see a mass of pre-cooked burgers. It takes time to create perfection. If you don't have the know how to create your own perfect burger, then shame on you, not on Cheeburger for your less than exceptional food. As their menu states, there literally thousands of topping combinations and if you can't find ONE to suit you then that sounds to me like a personal problem. :)  As I was saying, there are tons of topping combinations to choose from, more than enough burger sizes- ranging from a measly 1/3 pound to 1 full pound of cooked beef. Speaking of 1 pounders- if you eat the whole thing you get your picture taken and put on the wall of fame for all to see. Pretty spiffy. (Look for my brother: a repeat offender) Top off your burger with unlimited FREE toppings- how can you go wrong? And, I think I'd be selling this place short if I weren't to mention their gigantic flavor menu for their shakes and malts, which are supreme. I've never tried any of their other menu items (there are quite a few choices other than burgers & fries), but I'm sure they are good too. The prices are justified for the serving sizes and phenomenal tastebud stimulation that you receive. If you want a burger, Pepsi and fries, all for $5 that's short on size, bland and pre-cooked- try Burger King; but good luck to you. To make this review a lot shorter than it should be, I will sum up by saying that if you don't try this place and eat a CHEESEBURGER (for which they are named) then you're not getting the full experience here.

I was not too excited about my choice after the service and my food.  Service was very slow and the girl serving us was kinda blah and not interested in explaining their ordering method to us.  Which is a little different.  I ordered a lemonade, for 2.99, are you serious??  I also got a chicken Caesar wrap,  I should have gotten a cheeseburger I know, but we were having steak for dinner. There was WAY too much bad Caesar dressing, a gross amount of pepper jack cheese, only melted on a part of the wrap.  And there was chicken in one half and not in the other.  The other two got burgers and said it was good, didn't look like anything special to me.  Although they do have many choices for you to add to your burger.

I am a fan but there were a few things I wish were just a bit better. Exhibit A: The 1 lb burger was not that impressive, I wanted to try to get it down so I could get my picture on the walls and in the little books, but I decided not to.  I was expecting a monstrosity of a burger and it was just a big piece. I've made bigger burgers on my grill at home and there were 10 year old kids posing for the pictures. If 10 year olds can knock that down, i'm not impressed! haha. Exhibit B: for a root beer float, they charged $5, and for a fountain drink, they charged $2.99. That's strip prices, and this isn't the strip, this is on rainbow in an area that I assume doesn't get that much traffic. But hey, power to em if they can continue to get people to pay it. It was a hot day (duh, it's vegas in late June) Wednesday and I got a RB float so i guess they got me!  The price was good for the amount of toppings they allowed. There were about 25 things you can add to your burger for no extra charge, including a bunch of veggies and sauces, and you could even add two onion rings to your burger. Bacon was an extra charge, I think it was about $2~  Mostly it was a great experience, and the 7 ounce burger was a perfect size with the order of fries we all split and the root beer float for me. I was happy and next time I'm craving a Cheeburger I might swing over to this spot.  3.5 stars, I'll round up cause the food was in fact good", "Date": "2011-07-01", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Eve Michelle", "ReviewID": "PVrG-hnmPzKlhxCDrHo6NA", "Overall": "3", "Content": "This place has a pretty cool topping selection, but it does not hide the fact that the patty has no taste. I really love a patty that has some seasoning!!!  I also tried the onion rings and french fries. They were good, but I have had better. I also tried three of their signature sauces:   - Creamy Cheese - It needed salt. - Texas Horseradish - I usually do not eat horseradish, but I tasted it anyways and came to the conclusion that I still do not like horseradish. - Creamy Jalapeno - Bland.  It sucks that you have to pay for the sauces. I found myself dipping my fries and rings in ranch, which was free anyways.  Cheeburger Cheeburger has a couple of things going for them. The shake and malt selection is awesome. The 50's diner theme is pretty cool. Also, the contest for eating their 20 oz. burger is entertaining. Lastly, you could  Invent Your Own  anything here - cheeseburger, chicken sandwich, grilled cheese, salad, soda, iced tea, lemonade, shake or malt.  I doubt I will be back, but if I do, I will not be coming back for a cheeseburger, but for a Cinnamon Bun Shake!!!", "Date": "2009-01-25", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Beryl", "ReviewID": "-zoW1P1DuuGCdbo51rgvxw", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Kitschy place with fun trivia cards at the tables.

Go ahead and try to prove me wrong. They have more flavors of milk shakes than most place have items on their menus. On top of the staggering amount of choices you have to the option to mix more than one flavor into a shake. Cheesecake Smores? Done! Coconut, mango, and pineapple? Done! This just opens the door from amazing to mindblowing. Don't even get me started on the quality of the shakes. That cheesecakse smores I just mention above, real graham cracker crumbs in it. Yes I had it, and it was delicious. A large milkshake runs around six dollars and is served in the milkshake tin, but dont let the price scare you away. It's definitely more than enough delicious milkshake to warrant forking over six dollars for. Now as for the rest of the menu......  The hamburgers offer you another array of choices in the form of toppings and size, but even with all the toppings I just could not get over the lack of flavor that the hamburger patty itself had. It's definitely not on the bad end of the scale but for the price of the hamburgers you'd expect better. Their fry and onion ring platters do serve up a large amount of food for a good price but their dipping sauces are amazingly overpriced. One dollar for a dipping sauce? Come on now. The fries are a bit soggy and mediocre but their onion rings are a lightly battered, sweet ring of deliciousness.  I hate to give Cheeburger Cheeburger three stars but the only thing I can recommend coming here for is the milkshakes and onion rings.

We don't eat pizza that often. So a fancy cheeseburger restaurant with a retro feel is right up my alley. I'd take my grandfather here if he didn't commit suicide by refusing to take his blood pressure medicine for a month, resulting in a stroke. Because he would have loved it. He would have told me stories about how Hank Williams would have to hand Elvis Presley a gun if they ever fought just so that Elvis could even stand a chance at beating him. He really loved Hank WIlliams, thought Johnny Cash was too much of a prissy though.  But I digress, I love getting to live out an A1 steaksauce commercial from the 2000s. Steaksauce, on a burgerrr? Yes, it's that important. Fried pickles, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, and even more deep fried goodies are usually ordered instead of fries too. So I'm straight ballin' when I come here.

I almost drove by it since their is not a large sign or anything out front.  The restaurant is designed to be like a 50's burger joint, I think.    The menu is impressive, with milkshakes and burgers dominating most of it.  They only use angus beef for their burgers, so for some culinary reason, they only come cooked medium or higher.  I got mine medium well, and it was a little dry.  The burger was nothing special.  The unique thing about this restaurant is all the choices you have with the menu items.  There are muliltple, multiple milkshake flavors that you can combine to create something unique.  As for the burgers, there are different cheeses and toppings such as feta, cheddar, american, banana peppers, avocado, honey mustard, A1, etc.  I also ordered an onion ring and french fry appetizer.  The fries were made from whole potatoes, skin left on.  They were a little mushy on the outside as well as the inside.  The onion rings however were superb I thought.  The coating was very light and crispy, almost like tempura, it was not heavy and breaded.  The service was a little lacking for our group's visit.  Granted, it was a very large group, but you figure they would have some system for the waitresses to handle it.  Drink refills were inconsistent and took forever to get our bills.

My family of 4 and I finally made a stop. Upon entering I could think of one thing. Pink. And lots of it. My daughter loved it! We were seated rather quickly and started looking at the menu. We sat for a little longer than I find acceptable before we were offered beverages. My husband had a bananas foster/swiss chocolate shake that was AMAZING, it had fresh banana and a nice chocolate flavor. My kids each had a flavored lemonade. I ordered a pear/pineapple shake a soda but it didn't arrive with the others drinks. I had to remind our server to get my soda. So far our dinner is off to a bumpy start.   On to the menu. I really wanted the fried artichokes, mushrooms, and mac n cheese from the front cover, BUT,  I came for a burger. I noticed an Angus burger platter that comes with a 10oz burger, fries or onion rings, side salad or cole slaw, and grilled onions. You're able to choose from the free toppings list. I had my asked for my burger to be prepared medium and I chose blue cheese, tomato, cole slaw, pickles, 2 onion rings, mayo, and roasted red peppers as my toppings and onion rings for my side.   Our salads came. Nothing exciting mostly romaine, a little mixed greens, chopped tomato, black olives, and croutons.   One of the other servers? overheard my daughter saying she was hungry and had the kids food brought out right away. I love when people pay attention to the kids because usually servers noses are upturned when kids sit at the table. They had the kids hot dogs and fries. Neither of them are the hot dog but the fries were AWESOME.   Our burgers came and they were huge! I cut mine in half to see ZERO pink. We waited for a while since everything is prepared fresh. My 2 little ones were getting bored and were ready to leave by tike our food had come. There was no chance I was waiting on a re-cook. I took a bite. I was very underwhelmed. The meat patty was thick and flavorless. Dry even. I ate about a quarter of my burger and boxed the rest. The onion rings were okay, nothing to write home about. I wish I had ordered fries. My husband only ate half of his burger. We ordered a bananas foster/swiss chocolate shake to go.   Our server was nice. A little too busy/unfocused, but nice. Our bill was $53 before tip.

I've been to Burger Bar, Fuddruckers, etc. but the meat, toppings, fries and rings, and shakes all make the grade here and cost a little less as well.   The fries/onion rings basket mix is a favorite to share between my boyfriend and I, and with the cheese sauce dip we couldn't ask for anything better. The other sauces were okay, we weren't too thrilled with them, but the fries and rings can stand on their own without the sauces so we're okay with just the cheese sauce.   The meat patty itself could also stand on its own, and it's always so fresh and tender that it still falls apart as you bite into it. You can actually taste the meat flavor in it, which I think is something of a rare find for burgers these days that are drenched in salt and sauces.  Not that I don't like those too, but this patty is definitely the kind that you savor and enjoy. Furthermore, the toppings are to die for and if I could have them all on my burger at once, I'd totally be game to try it just to see if it's physically possible.   The milkshakes, which I guess pretty much everyone else agrees with, were to die for and are customizable to your own taste. My boyfriend has gotten pretty good with the flavor experimenting and we've had everything from a chocolate-covered pretzel shake (which actually had crushed pretzels in it), to a birthday cake shake that forced images of an insane birthday clown into my mind. Fun, exciting, and dangerous if not controlled properly.   The reason why I'm giving this place 3 stars is because of the service. And from reading the previous reviews, I think I'm the only one who may feel this way. I don't know if it's just coincidence, bad luck, or bad timing, but it seems that everytime we pay Cheeburger Cheeburger a visit, the service we receive gets progressively worse and worse. It wasn't bad at first, and we're well aware that it takes at least 15 minutes for the food to come out because it's freshly made, but for one person's burger to come 30+minutes after the rest of our table's food has come out is ridiculous. So is the notorious lack of drink refills, the long waits in between giving the wait staff our check and getting it back, the forgotten drinks and other side orders, etc. I don't think that we're a very demanding table either, since I've worked in food service, and we're pretty frequent diners around town, but it really spoils the experience of the food when the service is bad. Which is really too bad, because I personally think Cheeburger has the best burgers in town hands down.   Sorry for the ranting at the end, but I hope that the service improves soon because I keep wanting to bring people back with me to show them the glory of the Cheeburger, but remembering about how bad the service was makes me think twice about doing so.", "Date": "2010-03-04", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "J", "ReviewID": "aOuF0rzXwKApHVQznt5OcA", "Overall": "2", "Content": "I was able to make the UYE burger challenge after all, but didn't participate in the 1 lb competition.

It was very messy and I had to eat it with a fork and knife. It worked out to my favor because i got to take the top bun off to get more flavor of the burger. I finished it all. It was a tasty burger. I shared a half order of fries and onion rings, but we should have just got all onion rings. addicting. the fries weren't anything special. The service was great.

This little burger joint can be found on the east side of Rainbow, just south of Windmill Drive. It's kind of tucked away in there a bit, so you have to look out for it or you may miss it!  I do love the whole 50's Diner theme! It's a fun festive theme. It reminds me a lot of the 5 and Diner restaurant we used to go to as kids back in Phoenix back in the 80's (Do they even still have 5 and Diner locations open anywhere anymore??).  People here were very nice and friendly and the service was attentive. The young man who was our server was great about explaining everything and answering questions. After we received our food another lady stopped by and welcomed us and asked us how everything was going. We were pretty impressed with the service here from that standpoint.  I ordered a  Semi-Serious Burger , while my friend ordered a  Serious Burger .  We also decided to split a combo side of fries and onion rings. It is great how you can  build your own burger ! You have so many great options and combinations you can try! I had a pineapple on my burger!  Let me tell you, the burgers are pretty damn good! They were thick and juicy! The fries were thicker cut and not your standard generic  McDonalds/BK/JITB type fries. This is definitely a good thing! Onion rings were ginormous and pretty tasty as well!  The 2 big strikes against this place that drove us a little crazy was..  1) the service, while super nice, is painfully slllllooooooowwwwww...seriously, I thought they might have been killing the cow back there.  2) it is freezing in this place!

I had a veggie burger, and honestly, it wasn't the best veggie burger I have had. It was big, but a little dry and more of a grain patty than a fake meat variety. I have decided I prefer fake meat. I really should have gone for the turkey burger... or the 1lb burger challenge. Sometimes you just gotta have the real deal.   However, I am still a fan for a couple of reasons. First, from build your own salads for the vegetarian to the 1lb burger for the overachievers, there is definitely something for everyone. Second, there are a million ways to customize everything. Generally, this makes me a bit crazy, but I appreciated the choices. Numerous toppings for your burger and your salad, a gazillion milkshake flavors. Heck, you can even create a custom-flavored soda!  I had the platter which comes with a salad or coleslaw and rings or fries. It was $12, which may be bordering on pricey, but for some reason I did not mind. The salad came in a bowl (a decent size), and it was not iceberg! Brilliant!  And, I liked both their fries and their onion rings. Their fries were homemade, sliced not too thin or too thick, and served with a little bit of skin still on. The onion rings were lightly battered, skinny and delicious. Some people might prefer a big, fat onion ring, but I found this skinny variety rather addictive. They were just so easy to squash, dip and then slam in your mouth! Dangerously simple consumption.   The decor is retro diner, which leaves me neutral. I neither adore nor detest this theme.   As for service, I found it pleasant, organized and fairly prompt given that there were close to 20 in the party!

A friendly employee greeted me when I entered, asked if I was placing an order to go (I was) and then proceeded to answer the questions I had about the menu. This place is a control freaks dream come true. You get to decide almost everything that goes into your burger... The type of meat (they serve turkey burgers), the size, how well cooked it is, the toppings (most of which were free of charge, which was nice). The only thing I didn't see an option for was the type of bun. They also have salads and wraps that you order in a similar fashion, picking out all the toppings you want.  I ended up with the smallest burger, the Classic, and added cheddar cheese plus all the standard toppings I like: Lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup and mustard. That seemed a little boring to me, so I had them throw on some sauteed mushrooms (which was an additional charge).  The food took about 15 minutes to prepare. Nothing unreasonable, but next time I will either call my order in or place it online so I can avoid the wait. Once I got back to work and ate it, I was happy but not blown away. Not by the burger at least...   My birthday cake flavored milkshake was SO yummy! Like heaven in a cup yummy.

It started to kind of break apart as I was biting into the burger. It sat there a little bit as I was eating my fries first. .. But it felt like the top bun had not been heated at all.   Fries and onion rings were awesome!  But I think the onion rings were better then the fries in my opinion.  But then again I love onion rings.  :-)  Overall I would come back to try it again.  It was $15 for one person... burger, fries and onion rings and a drink.  I thought it was worth it.  I just hope that next time the burger is hotter.  Next time I will come at a busy time so that I can compare.", "Date": "2014-04-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Dee", "ReviewID": "SYvlWs0RuAGo0ko3h4-xVg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Everyone else has covered the burgers but I'm a shake fiend.  These are made from real ice cream in the stainless steel shake containers that are HUGE.  You can make any combo like amaretto + peanut butter +chocolate & no one bats an eye like how can you drink that...    The onion rings are ok, fries are standard, but if you don't have time to wait for your burger, don't come cuz the sign says they are not fast food.", "Date": "2009-02-10", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Allison", "ReviewID": "Vgwf9QLGJe5q9c8eu41B6A", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Cute 50s diner style with a friendly staff and good service.  The menu says you can have as many toppings as you want on your burger. What I didn't realize was that having my onions grilled would cost an extra buck. The bun was soft and fresh. Meat was a little over cooked for my having ordered  medium  but it was still juicy.  Onion rings were awesome. French fries needed to be ordered well done. It's like In N' Out Burgers in that the potatoes are fresh but the fries ain't so good.  Bummer that each sauce you order for dipping is a buck.  All these little extra charges add up.  We basically got one cheeseburger, a small combo of fries and onion rings, a soda and a juice and our bill was $21 not including  tip. The 2 sauces and my grilled onions added some of that extra cost.  Although the meal was tasty, because of the price, I probably won't be coming back anytime soon.", "Date": "2010-04-25", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Pinky", "ReviewID": "TEfGDVWSb_FCjjsY9jaG8A", "Overall": "4", "Content": "So, we're sitting home on a random Monday night trying to figure out what to eat. Every single day of my life I pass Cheeburger Cheeburger and laugh at the name. I figured it was like Chili's or Buffalo Wild Wings; turns out it's closer to a Johnny Rockets or an In N Out Burger!  I walked in and immediately noticed the  wall of achievers  to my direct right. Turns out there's an eating challenge here. Turns out that challenge is a one pound burger. Easy. So easy.  My friends all got a shake to start with, and in retrospect, I could have also. However, I decided to forgo the shake and just do the pounder. I ate the 1 pound burger (to which I added bacon) in under 5 minutes. Hardly a challenge. I also ate the fries, onion rings, and finished 3 diet cokes. I hadn't eaten all day. I ate like a champion. They took my picture, made me sign a waiver, and I contemplated another hamburger. I wanted to tack my picture onto the kid's Wall of Fame, but they wouldn't let me since I'm over 18.  I think at this point in the story it is important to note that I shaved all of my facial hair except for my pedo-stache. My picture at Cheeburger Cheeburger has me making a ridiculous face with a pedo stache and a stuffed hamburger. I've never been more proud in my life.  Back to the food; you can customize your burger with tons o' shit. It's like a slightly (better?) Fuddruckers. I felt like there were more topping options. The shakes looked scrumptious. The shake of the day was a frozen oreo hot chocolate; I tasted it and almost slipped into a coma.  I'm really glad I came here, and I'm going to go back so I can tackle the pounder again. I'm going to see if they'll make a new challenge with two pounders. THAT would be tough. They should name it the Burger Boner Bonanza.", "Date": "2010-12-14", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Honest", "ReviewID": "tNBP3-VNJou-QUqqd2ATzA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Great burgers and desserts, but the fries were not that good.
