It seemed to me, and I could be wrong about this, that the torta adobada had mayo on it.  It just seemed odd, not a flavor that I would expect in Mexican food.  It was good, fresh roll, nice size, but I thought the tacos were better.  I would have liked a little more flavor.  I added hot sauce and a squeeze of fresh lime.  The meat was cooked perfectly.  All in all, good, but not great.", "Date": "2016-09-17", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "J", "ReviewID": "6JtPYXJeTq1aqxGGx59zWw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Great inexpensive Mexican food. Dollar chicken tacos on tues. Better for take out as the dining room is small. They also serve posole everyday, which was surprising. Can't wait to try the enchiladas and their Spanish rice.

I transplanted into Vegas from Orange County, have had Mexican food from some of the greatest taco joints and carnicerias out there. Santa Ana! I have not had good experiences anywhere in town yet, since we moved. This place finally hits the spot!!! Perfect balance of ingredients. Great spices. Our second experience is even better. The area is a little sketchy, next to a budget motel, I recommend calling in your order and you're in and out in 3 minutes. Worth giving a try. Please! I don't want them to close lol", "Date": "2015-11-04", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Lizzy", "ReviewID": "esk7aWHii3LqIHfZvPSHaQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "This place brings back memories from California there Carne Asada and Al Pastor tacos are amazing!!

People always say you need to visit Tacos El Gordo for the best tacos in Vegas, but they are WRONG. Rodolfo's is the way to go!   The staff is super nice and very polite. Because its in a gas station, the lobby area is ridiculously small, there is only 3 booths available, so don't plan on dining in. Their street tacos are the best hangover cure, TRUST; and they are affordable, unlike Tacos El Gordo. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯   Vegas visitors: add this place to your to-do list.

Total price around $12 plus a few bucks to the sweet lady behind the counter who didn't speak much English but was super friendly.
