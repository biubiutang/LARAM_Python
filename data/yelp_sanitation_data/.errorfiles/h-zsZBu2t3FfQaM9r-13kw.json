I've seen things like sweet Adidas track suits and more recently, a cool looking shirt on a mannequin. This place has a tendency to make you spend on things that you don't really need. but you get it anyway! If you find yourself wandering inside Aria, check Elements out, you never no what you may find. ALOHA!!!

It truly reflects the ambience of the Aria - new, hip, sparkly, charming, dazzling. I love this place, simply love it. It is my style and the clothes are a nice fit on me. That's difficult to find with my body type. I have never seen a store that is completely my taste and if I could take one of everything home, I would! My favorite dress is from here. I'm not much of a shopper, but I did in fact go over my budget here! I can't say I've ever done that before. It's also always a bonus when the register workers are friendly people.", "Date": "2013-12-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "R", "ReviewID": "kopZvqSKcwA-OJ_pShF42g", "Overall": "4", "Content": "As someone mentioned, it's a nice upscale gift shop.  However, when I went in today they had a 50% off sale on a couple racks.  They also have a sundries area, which is nice and convenient for guests of the hotel.    I came in to pick up some scented sticks, the air fragrance in Crystals.  However, there was another scent used in Aria that smelled like Vanilla, so I got that as well.  Each stick lasts about two weeks and a container is about $25.  You can put them in your air vents and they'll freshen the air.    The good thing is the store is open 24 hours.", "Date": "2013-02-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Lauren", "ReviewID": "VwhqQudMqoeNcR-zlsVA8w", "Overall": "3", "Content": "I had to walk my butt all the way here from Vdara after asking the concierge where the nearest  convenience store  was.  Vdara didn't have one... so off I go!    After passing by their large buddha with bills and change strewn about, I found this lovely store.  The front has tons of  touristy  goodies... sweatshirts, keychains, purses, jewelry, etc.  The further into the store you go, the more practical the items for sale.    All I needed here was some Advil and Pepto.  Hey... it's Vegas... don't judge.  They have small  travel size  packages for those who don't want to buy whole bottles/containers.  They also have fridges along the wall filled with drinks and snacks nearby.    The service here isn't stellar.  It's a 24 hour location, so they're probably tired.  I would be too.  So many drunkies.    Anyway. I recommend this place for people staying at Vdara.  And Aria... obviously.", "Date": "2012-02-18", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Farrah", "ReviewID": "W7rnlRixTYvgLQlI54mJCQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "So this is the 24-hour gift shop/anything you need store at Aria.  Swim suits, tape, scissors, a hat, sunscreen, potato chips ... it's kinda like a fancy Walgreen's. If you're staying at Aria and decide you want some bubbly or wine, forget room service!  I asked the concierge if there was a price difference in buying a few bottles from Elements versus ordering from room service, and she highly suggested Elements. They had bottles of bubbly that ranged $20-200, which was more than reasonable compared to the least expensive $60 bottle of never-heard-of brand. We were doing a little lingerie shower in the suite before our first night on the town, so six bottles of Korbel at $20 a pop was well within budget.   Service was friendly, the place is spacious, and once again, it's open 24-7.", "Date": "2010-06-16", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Guy", "ReviewID": "Go913l9BZVVGcy5k1aoSMg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "This is a 24 hour LV Casino store on steroids. It's deceptively huge and sells anything you could want pretty much. It has the items that you would need for a hotel stay in case you forgot something (toiletries/drugs/lotions). They have food and drink items to party it up or to take to your room (snacks/alcohol/drinks). They have a huge array of souvenirs and Aria paraphernalia to satisfy any taste. I have never seen so many different types of Aria shot glasses. lol. They have higher end gifts such as expensive tea or nice bottles of wine or even expensive sunglasses. We found a lot of different little items to give away as souvenirs so it was a good find. Of course, I bought my 5-hr energy for the drive home as well.", "Date": "2010-08-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "J", "ReviewID": "b9wOtCbgwRmA1-D5N9PDPA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "It's a very nice, upscale gift shop that is open 24 hours for whatever you need while you're staying in the hotel.  Candy, Soda, Water, T-Shirts, Smokes, Shot Glasses, Bottle Openers, you know the standard tchotchky/convenience store you find in a resort.    This one is no different......useless stuff, high prices.....you know you're as guilty as me and buy stuff from these places from time to time.....that's when you kick yourself for forgetting the toothpaste and spend $7 for a tube the size of your thumb that will last 1 trip.

We were walking off the buffet food and we were browsing in this store for a souvenir of sorts for my sister. We found entertainment in all of the items that they had for sale.  This store has everything! We noticed an array of items such as classy design shot glasses or aria logo shot glasses, wine bottles, liquor, snacks, hair brushes of all kinds, aria apparel, nail polish, bath goods, medicine, fine jewelry, our favorite Teafort√© tea canisters, even playful intimate gifts such as edible body lotion, feather teaser/whip, and aphrodisiac candles - The list goes on with everything that they had available for purchase!  What actually caught my eye, was the dressy clothing they had out on display for women. I saw an elegant and sexy black dress that I had to try on, it was perfect for my upcoming birthday next week! I loved the cut and style of the dress, plus the beading on the sleeves were gorgeous!  The price of the dress was steep ($128), but it's obviously in line with typical casino store pricing. Also, they seemed short staffed, but the service was extremely professional and helpful. We definitely enjoyed this store!", "Date": "2014-05-27", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Kymberli", "ReviewID": "RM572jPl3RA7tQm-lum3Wg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Ummm...

My roomie for the weekend looked for the sundries store in our hotel and found this place... when you first come here, you think you're at a typical gift store... there's everything that says Aria~ cups, clothes, shot glasses, keychains... but there's a lot more!  There is also cosmetics, lotions, food, snacks from Dean and Deluca, all different chocolates from around the world, any type of alcohol you can think of, toys, ummm HELLO KITTY items!!!... It's a really big store.  I was unable to find the toiletries section, so I had to ask and she had told me a lot of people past by that area... she took me through a doorway with no door into this room full of everything you can think of... it is set up like a circle and there was EVERYTHING from soaps, toothpaste, toothbrushes, cell phone accessories, batteries... EVERYTHING.  The lady working there says most people walk by that room without even knowing what's in it.

You can buy there absolutely everything that a tourist needs but has forgotten to bring from home.

It's opened 24 hours, so you can go whenever you need.

They are over priced but that's expected at a Vegas upscale hotel. I like the fact they are open 24 hours.  However the reason I am giving them one star is this:  I saw a necklace on the mannequin I liked,  I looked at the price tag on the necklace of 34$ . I specifically thought to myself ok that's reasonable . I'll try it . I was trying to stay on a budget so checking the price was important before trying it on and loving it and it being more then what I wanted to pay. Since it was a good deal,  I asked  to try it on, the sales lady tried it on me .  I loved it and said I would take it. She was fidgeting with it (thinking she was just taking it off and on) not realizing she was removing the tag.... She rang me up . I also bought a top and two skirts .  The total seemed a little higher then my calculations but figured it was sales tax.   I walked out, got home checked my receipt and the necklace was rang up at 59.99 and the tag was now gone off the necklace!!!! What a scam! I specifically remember the price and thinking if it's more than 40$ I'm not getting it and it being 34 I said ok. Not to mention the tag was now off the necklace completely . How shady .... I called and asked to speak to the manager right away they said he's in, In the am.  So the next morning I called and he said he's sorry but there's nothing he can do . Lol.  Be careful when shopping here .", "Date": "2015-01-30", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
