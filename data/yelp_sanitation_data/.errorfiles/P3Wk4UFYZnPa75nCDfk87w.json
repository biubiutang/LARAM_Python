It's pretty small and tight but usually has what I need if I forget it from the larger Asian/Filipino markets. This is close to home, so it's convenient. I went here just the other day and noticed they have new items. More desserts and other items at the restaurant side. A new item is their homemade Kimchi which is a little different than Korean Kimchi. It has other vegetables in it, that are not usually in kimchi, I'm assuming it's used as a filler here. Large pieces of green onions/scallions. I'd prefer to get the Korean style Kimchi which they usually have in their market cold section.   I have tried their food at the express, and it's not the best.   Service is nice. Nothing to complain about but also nothing to rave about.", "Date": "2016-12-30", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Estephany", "ReviewID": "9_oLA8PqA8rZic9l70t13Q", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Worst market I've ever encountered.

I typically order the 2 item combo with kare kare and lechon kawali, with 1 additional side of something that looks good that day, perhaps some goat kaldereta or pork binagoongan, or even a fried bangus.  The food here is pretty decent for the price and what keeps me coming back is the kare kare - they have it all the time.  Other turo-turo spots only serve it up on certain days, which is a bummer since I always seem to want it when they're not cooking it.  So I end up back here to satisfy my craving.    With the extensive selection of food they have here, it is not surprising that they are busy here.

It's your normal Filipino fast food style restaurant in a small market. Cramped to say the least. They sell goodies from the Philippines here, which is awesome for my little fobbish family haha! They do have a small fresh fish and meat department at the rear end of the store-alongside a fridge with some fresh Asian vegetables as well.   The food they sell here is not the best but they were pretty busy-so maybe I just picked the wrong dishes when I went. I shared a plate of BBQ pork belly and  lechon paksiw  with my mother and all was just extremely oily and bony, not too appetizing. They have a few tables and chairs set up here for dining.   I'll probably be back again the next time I'm up in Vegas-the stores out here in San Diego don't sell the snacks they sell here at this store.", "Date": "2016-06-26", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Enang", "ReviewID": "tw1qlL2cRkwiGR6GPL6iZA", "Overall": "1", "Content": "I got in this market at 11.10 am on February 4,2016 ,while I looking food on tray ,lady worker talking joke about me something to another man worker beside her and both laughing as I can read they laughing I thought she talking shit or joking about myself as a transgender , she so rude so many time as I went there this is not the first time she did it I went there almost every morning buying food ,but this morning I was really agry for they laughing at me as a transgender .

I am however disappointed that I catch the workers eating on the buffet line which is a major food violation! Although it is just a worker grabbing a piece of meat with the tongs and eating it, her saliva while eating is most unsanitary. I have also experienced the bussers cleaning the tables and spraying cleaner on the tables right next to where we are eating, making our meal and myself nauseous! I think if management showed more discipline on their staff I would be here everyday. The food would be better and I wouldn't have to worry about getting sick from lazy unsanitary people.

All they do is ring up your items, tell you the total, and collect the money. No  thank you , no  did you find everything you need? , NOTHING!

Food is so-so, nothing special but it'll do.  Fresh meat/fish at the back and veggies too.   The guy at the fish/meat counter is very nice and accomodating.  Ordered 2 fried fish to go and got that right away--- very oily and super fishy smell, they need to clean their deep fryer.
