How hard is that?    This is a new breakfast \ lunch place in Henderson a couple doors down from the movie theatre on Eastern & Pebble.    A VERY large menu with interesting & diverse options, loved the icons on the ceiling tiles can't say I like this new trend of having diners writing on the walls..... just looks unkept to me.....however you know what they say about opinions.....     I always have a basic breakfast the first time a new place, 2 eggs scrambled, bacon (4 pieces, that's a lot!) potatoes & toast this is called a Rednecker.com, I think ~     All OK, could have hotter as it wasn't cold, just not hot and we all know eggs get cool quick! They are very proud of their potatoes......nothing FAB to me and I am a potato lover from waaaaay back.    The hubs has the Benedict..... same issue could have been hotter & the muffins were wet from the poached eggs not being drained b4 serving~    Coffee was good & plentiful in large cups. Lovely staff all very friendly, helpful & attentive.     Would we go back? SURE! And just request it to be served hotter next time. They are only open 7am ~ 2pm, take CC & if you can't find something on this menu to eat~ your just being difficult!", "Date": "2016-12-03", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jennifer", "ReviewID": "h04Npa9dt62HPbDVDGZi6w", "Overall": "5", "Content": "The food was excellent !!!

There's goods and bads to it. Most importantly, only come here if you've got loads of time (particularly during breakfast/brunch on the weekend).  The Good: - The decor is cute and fun. It's all Vegas and a bit kitschy. I loved all the aliens. - Be sure to check-in on Yelp and get a free mimosa or bloody mary. (Good only for the standard mimosa and bloody mary. They do also have a top-shelf bloody mary and various mimosa flavors.) - The menu is very plentiful. So many options to choose from! - The wait wasn't nearly as long as we thought it would be. - The portions are sizable. - The potatoes are particularly yum. - The servers were friendly. - When someone finally asked how everything was (after we were already done eating), my friend made a face. This resulted in an apology from the guy, an apology from our server, and a discount on our bill. None of that was necessary and was definitely a sign of care and good service.  The So-So and Bad: - One of our mimosas took over 30 mins to get. They clearly had just forgotten about it. - Yes, everyone at our table checked in on Yelp and obnoxiously redeemed the Yelp check-in offer. But they still tried to charge two of us for our drinks. - We were asked what kind of toast we wanted, but it was never actually served with our meals. And no one even came by to check on us after food had arrived - so there was no one to tell. - It took 10 mins to get silverware. No, for real. And that was only when we got up and physically walked over to where the place settings were kept. - We were asked what special sauce we wanted (they offer three kinds) and those were never served either. And again, no one checked on us, so we couldn't even ask about them. - Our food was ok, but not amazing. And while that's not really a bad thing, considering everything else so-so/bad, the food sorta needs to make up for it. - It was a really lengthy dining experience. Again, not necessarily a bad thing at all. But when the service is so lacking and you're missing items... Well, it makes it less of an enjoyable long experience. - I thought the Spanish Flay was lacking in flavor. The potatoes in the omelette were under-cooked. And the bacon I paid to add-in was pretty much raw. Not appetizing.  Hmmm, so maybe, just maybe, this spot would be better on a non-weekend day? Maybe there are better menu items? I wouldn't be opposed to giving this spot another shot. But I'd probably avoid another weekend brunch trip.", "Date": "2017-01-18", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Michael", "ReviewID": "MGwRvnN-0obuqtX1yNQ1BA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Came here this morning for the first time.

There was no flavor, and the meat was dried out to the point of not being able to eat it.  It was so bad that I told my girlfriend that I would pick up the 45 dollar check if she could finish it.... she declined the offer.  The pancakes were dry and tasted over cooked.  Also the eggs Benedict  was sad.   The sauce was strictly butter, and no texture.

Where to begin..  Walked in on a cloudy Sunday morning around 10:30am and as expected there was a packed house! Which I don't think is a negative right away.. there has to be a reason right?!  ...The food is great and they don't have enough tables to seat everyone or the service is long and slow.. hmmmm. We were a party of 3.. my wife, daughter and of course me. We waited longer than needed as there were empty tables that needed to be cleaned. The place had personality as there was writing on the walls - that kept us entertained as we waited. Once we were seated the server was friendly and took our order. Our coffee and drinks came at a reasonable time. The coffee was good. Then we waited, and waited, and waited. As we looked around several others were growing restless waiting for their food. It was obvious by the looks on their faces. We had a few coffee refills and then waited and waited and waited. We watched as parties that arrived after us were served first, yet there were several people with empty cups and no food in sight. Finally, after what felt like a 20 to 30 minute wait the food arrived. It looked okay. I ordered the Racy Tracy, wife ordered So Cal Low Cal with side of fruit, and daughter ordered a teddy pancake. The Racy Tracy was loaded with bacon that didn't look freshly cooked, tasted below average. The potatoes were good (4 out of 5) nice and crispy but the omelette was bland and flavorless (3 out 5 at best). My meal came with toast and I got ONE piece cut in half (who does that?) - it is standard to get two pieces. My wife did not enjoy the So Cal Low Cal. Flavorless and earthy. She had to smoother it in Cholula hot sauce (1 out of 5). The fruit was a 5 of 5 - large portion, fresh, yummy.  My daughter's $6.50 pancake was chewy. Not fluffy, nothing special except the teddy shape. We had to use a knife to cut it - not appetizing.  It's hard to mess up a pancake, but this was not good.  The service was below average. They were friendly and nice, but disorganized and all over the place. When our bill came it was about $50 (for an average at best breakfast). Luckily we had a coupon for a free kids entree (the pancake).  We left less than impressed or satisfied. We would have been better off at a drive thru. I would not recommend this place nor would I return. This is unfortunate because we love eating out and love to see new places succeed. This place's claim to fame is that it was featured on a food network show. Unfortunately, it was not good.", "Date": "2017-01-08", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Leland", "ReviewID": "dLeF0ANkev2B_8jyqrY0ug", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Ugh.  I feel kind of ripped off.  Took my daughter for brunch today and we were far from impressed.  First, we had to wait ten minutes for a table when there were at least three free.  We were not alone having to wait.  It seems that all tables have wait about ten minutes even when plenty are free.  Altogether, we were in the restaurant for 90+ minutes which is 30 minutes too long.    Now the food.  The menu can be confusing, and a couple tables next to us were struggling to decide what they wanted.  I think the pancakes and waffles have potential, but our omelettes were simply not good.  I got the Spanish Flay and it was bland.  2/3 of the plate was potatoes and inside the dish it was 90% potatoes.  They ask if you want a sauce and I selected their  cheese  sauce.  It was a side of nacho cheese.  Not what I was expected for this price.  My daughter had The Biggest Little Omelette which has shrimp.  The entire dish had two shrimp in it.  Literally.   It was also very bland.  The place really seemed to be struggling.  Two of three tables next to us had some sort of comp due to issues.  One table was almost done eating before one of them got their food.  We elected not to complain as we were just sick of sitting.    Now my biggest issue.  For two meals and two drinks (soda, not alcohol) my check was $39.  Seriously?  That much for brunch food in Vegas?    Maybe we will come back and try again in a few months when the dust settles.  For now, we will continue to go to Truffles and Bacon in the same shopping center.  We find their food is much better and more reasonable.
