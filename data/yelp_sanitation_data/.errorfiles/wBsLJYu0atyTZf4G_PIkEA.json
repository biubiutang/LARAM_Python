Bathrooms are very clean, and the drinks are reasonably priced.  A nice change from the other gay bars in town, this bar is cool, low key, has GREAT music, and if you feel like being a tourist again, all you have to do is go down the escalator and walk around Freemont.     They have a coreographed drag show every half hour on fridays.  It was awesome... but my mother made a comment that made me laugh:,  I would hate to be the coreographer of that group... you know, cuz they're all Divas.  You would tell them, 'left, right, hip' and one of them would say, 'o no, coco does not do that'.

Too bad I didn't finish mine sooner.  I was there the second night they were open (4/21/12) and had a blast.  Oh well.  At least I was the first to post a picture (Hey, Naya!).  Drink and Drag is located at the end of Freemont Street in the virtually vacant two-store shopping center, Neonopolis.  Walk into the center of Neonopolis then take the escalator or evelvatSince going here I haven't stopped thinking about it.  Probably because when I signed up for their text alerts I now receive daily reminders about the fun.  But that's okay.  It makes me want to go back to Vegas just to be go to Drink and Drag.  This place is drag queen overload - bartenders, bar backs, waitresses, even the bowling shoe rental girl.  Nearly every one of them was super friendly and fun to talk with.  Unfortunately, the drag queen bartender was cold.  I'll forgive her and say she was just stressed because it was the first few days they were open.   The only guy there (at least dressed as a guy) was bartender Rick.  He was awesome!  Rick was friendly, engaging, and definitely working it so you'll come back again.  Performances seemed to be spontaneous.  If a cool song came on, all of a sudden there were drag queens every where you looked performing their interpretation of it.  Dedication to a performance was somewhat self indulging. It was more of a  look at me  performance than doing it with purpose to entertain the crowd.  The go-go dancers exhibited the same lackluster attitude.  The night I was there Delta Work from RuPaul's Drag Race was the headliner.  When it was time for her to perform she came out without introduction, did one song acting if she was bothered to be there.  Toward the end of the song she spotted an exit door and left quickly without fanfare.  Rather disappointing, but, that's a really a critique of Delta, not Drink & Drag per se.  The crowd was very mixed, most likely due to the location at the end of Freemont Street.  Drinks were weak, but tolerable; not worth $9, though.  It's a big bar with lots of seating around the main bar and other nooks all around.   Most of the balls at Drink and Drag are tucked and tape, but there are others to play with.  They've got a pool room with 5 beautiful tables and a 12 lane computerized bowling alley (very nice!).  Since being their I've received texts for fun nights like underwear bowling - hmmm.  One very odd thing was their obsession with iPads.  Several employees had them in their hands all the time staring at them and clicking away constantly.  Two of them in particular were so engrossed in their iPads that I don't think they ever noticed what was really happening in the bar.    I have high hopes for this place as it has a lot of potential.

We went this past Tuesday night and they were hosting Tight N White Tuesdays: strip down to your underwear and you get to bowl and play billiards for free and get 2 free drinks.  I won't mention if I partook in that activity (I didn't) but there were definitely some takers.    The scene is fun, dark, and different.

The one thing that I feel could be better is the music. It's sort of all over the place and no one stays on the dance floor for more than two or three songs. The DJ seems passive at best as he hits shuffle on his iPod and lets Jesus take the wheel, for lack of a better term. I hope it stays around for a while.

The fun starts as soon as you walk in. With an open heart and some cash in your pockets. It calls for a good time.  I think the gay world marketing team can definitely do something a little bit more creative with their specials/marketing ploy. We are gay, so give us something to be gay about.

Some friends told me to go there to hang out and get some cheap beers.  I didn't even know this place existed.  Well, let me back up.  Drink & Drag is in the horribly sad Neonopolis shopping mall downtown.  For a year and a half, I worked on a TV show that was in studios that were built out of 3 of the movie theatres.  That whole time, that mall was dead.  We heard rumors that they were going to revitalize it, but it has never happened.  And that was like 2006.  Jillian's used to be in this mall, and they had a smaller back room where you could bowl.  It sucked then, but there were limited edible food options on our lunch hour, so we'd occasionally go there.  Now it's Drink & Drag, and it's just worst.  Loud music like you're in a club, with bowling, and then dudes in speedos and people in drag.  Just seems like an awfully weird combination.  Granted, I'm not gay, so maybe I'm missing the appeal.  But places that try so hard to be SOMETHING MORE seem destined to fail.  They're a small bowling alley with a bar, can't we just leave it at that?  This guy is not your target audience, I guess.

Ms. Desarae and Leikia took wonderful care of my friends and I. Make no mistake that when asking for a strong drink, Desarae does not fool around. I left my fate in her hands and she handed me a rainbow sprinkle rimmed adio and bid my ass farewell. There was no sour mix or sprite, just pure alcohol. When her inquiries about how messed up I was did not suit her, she poured more vodka into my glass. One drink from her equals three drinks from anyone else.

The GO GO boys were not all that and had no sense of beat.   What is going to shut this place down is the service, well the LACK OF. I went Friday night and I ordered a Bacardi and Diet. I got my drink and it was like drinking gasoline. I told the waitress that this was not Bacardi and she proceeded to argue with me. I gave my friend a drink and I told her to watch his face. He took a drink and gave the big sour face I knew he would. The waitress went to the bar then came back with her little Ipad and told me that the bar does not carrie regular Bacardi. WHAT GAY BAR DOES NOT CARRIE BACARDI? She told me that is it was Bacardi 151. I told her to take it back because it was way too strong. We were close to the bar. When she took it back to the bartender, he started yelling at the waitress and said he would not exchange it out. She came back told me and then said she would get a manager. The manager came out, went to the bar, talked to the bartender and had him fix the drink. I got my drink with Well Rum. I called the manager over and told him there did not need to be that much drama over a drink and that the bartender yelling at the waitress was unacceptable. All the manager had to say was,  Well they don't get paid to be smart . Wow, that is thinking highly of your staff. The manager came over later and gave me three free drink tickets.   Drag Queens in a place like this should be OVER THE TOP FUN! These drag queens all looked miserable and when it was time to do their group lip sync (about every hr or so). None new any of the words to the songs.   Another friend called me last night (Tuesday May 15th) and asked me to meet him there, I said no but then he talked me into it. I figured I would use my free drink ticket.  I went to use my free drink ticket and because I ordered a call brand. I had to pay $3.00 along with my ticket. WTF. A free drink ticket that was not so free. LOL. OMG. I guess I did save $6.00 since the drink is $9.00 by itself.   Same miserable drag queens and same bad lip sync.

I don't know if they were gay but I don't really care, I'm married but not dead!   Super Gay Sunday's rock. Even though the website says that their Super Sunday Happy Hour starts at 4pm, the club didn't open til 6. For such a great deal on bowling and drinks the place was pretty empty, maybe 4 out of the 12 lanes were being used at once. So before 9pm on Sundays bowling cost only $1 per person per game, plus $3 shoe rental (shoes run really big). As we played we were served by the delightful and attentive Lauren...$1 drafts and $2 wells! That's crazy! And the drinks are huge. I also had one of the dreamy bartenders whip me up something special, it was $9 but it was yummy. The music was decent club music, disco lights glimmer spill across the alley's as you throw their heavy balls down the lane.  I really thought the  drag queen  theme would be in your face, but it wasn't at all. Very laid back, fun vibe. Some of the Drag Queens would jump up on stages and show off their dancing queen skills during the night. Tip em if you like what you see! If you're interested they also have billiards, board games, air hockey and PS3 games on the big screen. Don't forget about a snack. My husband told me the mens room has pictures of the Drag Queens  admiring  your goods. The girls room wasn't as entertaining. If you park in the Neonopolis garage be sure to get your parking ticket validated before you leave, so parking will be free.

In fact, it's almost as large as my appreciation for the unusual and quirky in general.  So how can any situation be truly critiqued for wanting to check out a place that has  bowling  and  drag queens  brought up in the same sentence?  Thus begins my newest review adventure.  These two topics became the point of discussion among some friends and I, and curiosity was far too strong to not see what this was about.   I have to give credit where due: The bowling set-up is nice.  It's only a few lanes, but they are well maintained, and cheap.  Holy crap, are the lanes cheap.  For a late afternoon/early evening jaunt between three people?  $6 for the lanes for 4 hours.  Shoe rentals are an extra $3, but that's one heck of a value.  There's also an added bonus: They have these green  Stoli  pins that, if placed as the lead pin and a strike is rolled, you get a free round of drinks for your party.  I guess all those months of Kinect Bowling finally paid off, as I nailed that sucker to the cheers of friends, fellow bowlers, and drag queens alike.  The winning shots?  They're by no means small, or subtle.  And it was shortly after that I noticed my previously good game going straight to Hell.  Even  Granny rolling  it wasn't doing much for my score at this point.  I commented to our hostess that I was getting the feeling that's part of their  master plan  to prevent easy access to more free booze.  I got a far too innocent yet knowing grin and a wink from our hostess in response as she walked away.  Did I mention that they serve Uncrustables as bowling snacks?  Apparently, there are also Moon Pies.  The service all around was very nice.  Low key, no pressure, and a very distinct welcoming vibe, no matter what your background is.  Elena, the girl who headed up our bowling needs, was very friendly and attentive, as were the two hostesses who poured drinks for our team that night.  Our drinks were brought to us at the lanes, so I can't really confirm/deny if the overall bar service is generally slow, though it did take a while to get people together when it came time to settle up the bar tab at the end when we finally made our way up there.  There also have a video gaming lounge where people can hang with Playstation games on massively huge screens, and a respectable number of pool tables.  Also of note, while this bar does allow smoking, the hostesses were walking around with cans of air freshener to keep the air from smelling stale and smoky.  Finally, a Vegas bar that shows some love for the non-smoker crowd.  I can't believe that this simple concept is such a rarity in local lounges around here.  Overall, Drink & Drag succeeds in providing a very casual and fun atmosphere.  The staff that attended to us were pleasant, funny, and entertaining.  The drinks, while a little on the pricey side (for an average beer, anyway), were good and well stocked, and if anything, the draw of incredibly cheap bowling is certainly worth a second mention.

A short ride to Downtown later, and I found myself at the threshold of Drink & Drag.  Sight for sore eyes, it certainly was.  It's tucked back off of Fremont just a touch, upstairs in an otherwise dilapidated shopping area, mostly shuttered.  Inside?  Damn near heaven, that's what!

Drink and Drag not only saved my Sunday, but kind of turned me around on the whole Vegas experience, for reals.  Normal prices, amazingly attentive staff, slick look and feel, tons of room: total win.  Sweet 'tender tried to put me in a cab, but I said,  No, thanks, lady.  I'M TAKING THE BUS!

Something really cool.  Top that off with drag queens that put the queens on  Drag Race  to shame, and what do you get? Something FAAAAAAAAAAAAAABULOUUUUUUUUUUUS!!!  Drink and Drag is a ton of fun. We went a few weeks back during happy hour, and the vibe is too fun. It's in the Neonopolis building so it's a little hard to find. First you gotta park, which is always the detriment of the downtown area. Find Heart Attack Grill, step over the bodies dying of cardiac arrest, and head up the escalator.  Once you're in, the bar/bowling alley (formerly Jillian's Bowling-a-Go-Go) is amazing. There's a very groovy mod/retro feel to it, and the lights give that feeling that any moment now someone's going to jump out and call you a  jive turkey.   The queens are fabulous, but more importantly, super friendly and with great service.  And the big important thing (since I don't go amongst  my nation  that much) is that I didn't feel scrutinized every single second. Which is totally helpful, cuz that makes me sweat. And most guys don't hit on sweaters. Or guys that wear sweaters. Or sweaters who wear sweaters. You know what I mean. Point being... the straight guys who went with us were totally as comfortable there as the gay ones, so guys, if your friend wants to take you there, go... they're not taking you to auction you off!  Totally a five-star place if it wasn't for the usual parking nightmare near Fremont. Plus, I was totally into Insert Coin(s) until it got super-popular and almost impossible to get into past 11pm.

I have, however, experienced elements of the service, which is what I'm basing this review on.  We planned one night of our Vegas trip around Drink & Drag --it looked like so much fun!  I checked the website and event calendar in advance to make sure we understood what to expect, where to park, what the theme for the evening was, etc.  As suggested on the site, I submitted my name and contact info to be added to the guest list for our chosen night.  I even ended up emailing them with an additional question about the theme (when I do a drag club, I do it right).  I received no response, but thought nothing of it since many businesses don't always check their inbox.  We came all the way to Neonopolis from the strip, excited for an evening of drinks, queens, and bowling...to find the place entirely dark and closed up! There was a note on the door saying they were temporarily closed. BUMMER.  I get it. Shit happens.  If something forces you to close for a few nights, so be it.  However, it seems like good business sense to update the website to reflect a closure, OR email those who have eagerly signed up for that evening's guest list that there has been a change.  I had been on the website that same afternoon, and according to the calendar we were good to go for Hawaiian themed hula hooping and limbo contests.  Had I been aware the place would be closed, we could have saved ourselves the hefty cab fare and hit up a different drag scene.  I hope to return to this place some day and have a great time, but in the future I would definitely CALL first to inquire about the hours, not trust the seemingly unmanned website.

I liked they do random blast specials like for the next 5 minutes drinks are $5 when we were there and their facebook advertises some very attractive drink specials like 2 for 1 nights w/ flyer or text, $2 drinks, bowl and snacks day, etc. The selection was mostly flavored vodkas and not much for me to work with in terms of whiskeys or gins and no craft beers. Still, if you are looking for a cheap drinks this might be paradise. The sound system isn't good quality and they were playing the most overplayed Top 40 so it wasn't hitting the fabulous factor in that. I should maybe check in on a EDM night or a night with a DJ in.    I love the semi-private bowling lanes with comfy looking bench seats so the BF and I agreed this might be fun to go one quiet afternoon with friends. The prices seem below most big bowling spots pricing regularly and they advertise some days have $2 game specials so it definitely seems like it'll be a better option than going to a casino.

Poor selection of alcohol. Drinks are not expensive for Vegas but they are for the quality.  Many of the DJs are terrible. Some nights they are really on but most nights you just want the music to stop.  The bartenders routinely ignore women.  The servers are so rude and dishonest.    One night, after particularly bad service my friend paid with a card but tipped in cash.  Apparently the waitress didn't feel like that was enough so she ADDED a $20 tip to the card charge.  My friend didn't know until she got her bank statement.  Another time a bartender made our drink wrong.  We pointed it out, not trying to send the drinks back, we just planed on ordering more so we wanted to her to make the future ones right.  She became a total bitch about it and told us she never made drinks wrong and that we were just drunk. (It was 8:30 and this was our first drink.)

When we got  to our lane and put our shoes on, all of our shoes were a size too large, perhaps a misprint on the shoes. So we took our shoes back to ask for smaller sizes and the queen said  We don't have kid sizes.   Seriously, we were asking for size 5's instead of 6's.... in adults...obviously.

After all, before the gays, West Hollywood was just a grungy area of unincorporated LA county.  Palm Springs? Forgotten movie star playland.  I wonder if Avalon would be cooler if the Santa Catalina Island Company started to promote to gays?  Anyway, all these thoughts went through my head and then I saw an ad for Drink and Drag, so I decided to check it out.  Once again, someone beat me to the punch.  First visit was around lunch and they were closed, but the door was open and I found one of the employees telling some tourists what the place was about.  I came back later in the evening, got some drinks (they still let me get the 2-for-1 special even though it was like one minute until it was supposed to be over).  They were all really friendly.  Employees were a mix of drag queens and go-go boys.  By the way, drag queens dancing in the bowling lanes is hilarious.  Also, I don't normally go to bars alone, but did in this case.  Found the patrons to be really cool and met a couple of new friends.    So run, don't walk (unless you're in high heels) to Drink and Drag!", "Date": "2012-04-29", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Julie", "ReviewID": "JL-KUgeRq-CQw3MBW5t6BQ", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Ahh, drink and drag.   This was my second visit and first time hosting an event. my reasons for choosing D&D is that I like that they have so much space and activities to choose from including bowling, pool, video games, to name a few. . . that aspect appealed to my friends as far as variety. I don't really consider D&D a club and for that I disagree with the cover fees! also, the drinks are grossly overpriced.   For location, activities, group space, and even the ladies in drag, all a thumbs UP.  but pricing, cover fees, rude staff attitudes, even the cocktail of supplies for  purchase  in the bathroom, little over the top.   Much thanks to Christina, David, Michael, Nelson, Sylvia, Kim, Alida, Helen, and of course many more for showing up even briefly and supporting me in my 1st Vegas UYE. Love you guys/gals and I will plan a near future event which is a little less alcoholic and scattered to where I can hopefully meet more of you in an intimate dining scene and have some one on one time.

They have five or six bowling lanes, a bar, and a pool area (to play pool, not a pool with water). As one of my friends pointed out though, the lanes aren't designed for serious bowling. (I guess you can't see the dots on the floor or something like that.)   I liked that the lanes each had plush seat banks for the bowlers to sit down. Not those hard plastic seats like at an actual bowling alley. The waitress was attentive and came by frequently. They didn't offer any specialty drinks (or at least that I could see), but otherwise had a fully stocked bar.   The place is upstairs in Neonopolis. We were there a little early, about 7:30pm, and it was a bit dead. But by 10pm, it was crowded, mostly around the bar area.   Also, one last thing -- when I took out my digital SLR to take pictures of my group, security came over and told me that while I could take pictures with my cell phone camera, I couldn't use a  real  camera. Huh?   Overall, we had a blast, and its definitely worth checking out.", "Date": "2012-12-21", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
