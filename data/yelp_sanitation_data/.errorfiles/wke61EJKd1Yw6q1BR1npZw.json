We finished our DTLV night after Park on Fremont here with fellow yelpers plus meet up with more yelpers in toasting Noah R birthday. My first impression was wow its really nice and man think under dressed for it. It definitely more of upscale bar or without doubt out of the all the bars clustered together downtown this one by far most upscale and classy arts look too it. The artwork on the walls most of them huge paintings of have no idea or the cool chandeliers. It kind of dark got me thinking at the haunted mansion ride at Disneyland. The artwork feel like person staring right into your eyes so waiting for the eyes too move or something. Lol! Just the details too the interior is pretty darn cool!! The upstairs patio area sure something unique too downtown and on perfect weather day (that night it was) nothing better in life. The view looking down see the vibe going on that night, break out few dance moves with the music going on, and see El Cortez Hotel all the history of that Hotel too downtown. Patio for sure cool spot too chill out hanging out with friends drinking enjoying life. When the place is packed it totally like club because we walked around too check it out and push my way through get from one end too another. Almost missed they have this cool game or people playing so never figured it out. You throw some object attached too string at target and that about all I got. Sure next time I visit going too figure it out.  The prices it not that bad still pricey but cheaper then going too club or drinking on the strip for the most part?  This coming from someone like me going clubbing few and far between so take it for what it worth. Lol! I really like the vibe of the place and between the patio and inside lot of different places can hang out get your drink on at Commonwealth.

There is one DJ downstairs for more mellow music, and a DJ upstairs (where my homie was at) for people who are trying to turn up! Everyone there was having a good time. The music was so good upstairs, that there was a line for people downstairs to come up.  I love that there is a bar upstairs and downstairs.

My homegirls & I went here for my 21st (on a Friday night) & we had a blast. I loved the vibe. The 2nd floor is my favorite bc of the dance floor. We danced all night & met tons of cool people. The dj played great music ranging from old school hip hop/rnb to modern day edm/pop. We went around 10 pm & there was a decent amt of people, but most people didn't start showing up until around 11:30 pm/12 am. By 12:30, the dance floor was packed.  The only downside was that for some reason, they were charging everyone to go upstairs to the 2nd floor that night. Luckily, my 4 homegirls & I managed to get upstairs for free. However, my other homegirl who came later had to pay $20- but she received 2 free drink tickets, which I guess somewhat compensated for the $20 that she had to pay.

Whenever we are out downtown we make it a point to either end the night at this bar or go there at some point.  The overall atmosphere is relatively relaxed, it's an urban, hipster speakeasy. Later in the night there is a cover for guys, usually around $5, but I believe there's never one for girls. Drinks run you around $8-$10, which is much cheaper than the Strip.  My favorite part is definitely the rooftop dance floor. It's a fun experience with the hanging string lights and views of Fremont Street and the Strip. The music and DJ's are always on point on Friday and Saturday nights, usually playing a mix of throwback and contemporary hits.  The only negative is that later on in the night the line to get up to the roof can get pretty long.

The decor is really nice; sort of urban chic with exposed beams and hanging lights. It's got lots of different seating arrangements, so there are options no matter what the size of your group. I'm a really big fan of the fact that it's smoke free!  The cocktail menu there was definitely interesting and very reasonably priced; much better than I would have expected given how nice the place is and it's location. Cocktails were on average about $10 which is very fair, but a straight Jameson was also $10 which doesn't make a lot of sense.   The staff was all very nice; all the bartenders were friendly and eager to help. The people there seemed pretty nice too, but I hear from trusted friends that it can get a little douchey on the weekend when it's less of a locals crowd. I'm looking forward to going back again to see for myself though and I'm hopeful that this bar will be my new favorite stop on Fremont.", "Date": "2013-02-14", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Monica", "ReviewID": "54jelh3C6uGM61hBFEPFaw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "This place is very entertaining in every inch of it except for my date night (today) I had an okay music experience.

Finally had a chance to check it out last night on a first Friday since it's the only time I go to downtown LV.  I was kinda intimidated at first since I'm not really used to seeing people in downtown all dressed up fancy and $hit. I felt under dressed but hey it's downtown.  Who dresses up to go here?   I was really impressed though with the decor of this place, from the  postered  up wall, chairs, chandelier and so on. And damn,  people here are good looking.  Never been in a place where my neck went sore from turning heads from these stylish attractive ladies and no homo but the guys here are good looking too, haha. My friend Morgan was the Dj that night too, spinning all the great underground hiphop with beats that got everyone vibe''n and getting down on the dance floor.    One thing I didn't like though was the drinks here were expensive, something you'd expect from the strip and not downtown LV. Ordered my first organic beer (Samuel Smith) apricots which deducted $13 bucks from my already light wallet that night.  Gotta admit, best beer I've ever tasted though.  I'll definitely come back here again though and dressed up all stylish next time.

This was the second time I had come here, the first was their opening week and I walked in, up, down, and out in under ten minutes. The place is gorgeous, but the scene is not my cup of tea.   So this last visit was due to a good friends birthday get together. He reserved a table  and they gave us the whole section by the door. Their chairs are pretty cool. I believe the birthday was going to steal the Beatlejuice seat at one point during the night. Like I said, I love the decor in this place, though there are so creepy pictures hanging up.  Jimmy cricket and the Lorax , looking picture did entertain the group for some time.   Anyway, just so you all are aware, to reserve a table the minimum you must spend is 250, plus the 50 for gratuity so that is $300 dollars to have a table on the weekend. That is a lot, for me at least. However, I think everyone got at least 3 drinks, and the birthday boy 4. There is about 6-7 of us at one point. I would say that if you are with a huge group, go for it, but if not, find a space on the bar and wiggle your way in.   If you do get a table then your service should be pretty good. Our server was Shannon or Sandra, Shauna maybe. It started with an S, but she was pretty good. There were times she took her time, but I have a feeling that was due to the bar being backed up with the crowd. So, whoever was behind the stick that night was trying their best I am sure. Other than that, she was super sweet, suggested some good drinks for folks who didnt know what they wanted, and I asked for a lager (because I couldnt read the chalk board of beer names) and she brought me a Harp. My favorite! Then I saw they had Magic Hat #9 and switched. They have a pretty good beer list my friends. Pricey, but good.

The line may seem long to get in, but they're usually really good about getting people in fast and with your entire group. The drinks are normal priced for what you would see in downtown Fremont, around 10-12$ a drink, obviously depending on what you get. Most nights you have to pay a completely separate cover charge to get upstairs, which in my opinion is a lot more enjoyable because they have a live DJ that plays a lot of hip hop music and there is another bar up there too.  With all of these points I would love to give Commonwealth at least 4 stars, however, I would love to see a staff change in some way in relation to who is in charge of security at the front door. The gentleman was rude, degrading and just overall acted like everyone coming into the bar was an inconvenience to him.

That is the treatment we received last night from the management and staff, and that is what this place basically is. Low class in hospitality and customer service, disgraceful and and embarrassment not only Fremont, but to the city of Las Vegas in general.   We chose to celebrate downtown for a friends birthday, and Commonwealth was the only and biggest mistake of the night. We had a 4 guy, 5 girl ratio, and like most Vegas establishments, especially on a holiday weekend, we as gentlemen knew that ladies were free and that we would have to pay. This was not a problem. The issue arose after we tried gaining access to the terrace, and paid additional $20 for a wristband and two drink tickets. We had no problem paying this also, as gentlemen of Las Vegas we knew what to expect. However, every woman we were with got a stamp to gain access to the terrace for free... Except one of our girlfriends.   When trying to understand why the bar manager was discriminating against a woman for being overweight, he stood there uselessly reaffirming their bad judgement and made it clear that they only want stereotypical type A women and anything outside of that is required to pay $20 dollars at the bar.   I was astonished to not only hear the words this jerk was saying, but baffled because of all the years that I have lived here in Las Vegas (24 to be exact) and going out to multitudes of places, I have never had a woman I was with singled out in such a disrespectful and demeaning way. Body shaming patrons who pay good money to have a good time, and this is the reward? I didn't even request a refund, nor did any of the other men who joined us that night. We all left as a collective group immediately after the 20 minute verbal altercation. I returned later that evening to ask for the name of the manager who treated us so poorly. The coward either didn't know his own name, or didn't have enough courage to face the ramifications of his actions. What an embarrassment!   This management and how they choose to condone this behavior is the exact reason why Las Vegas has such a bad reputation. I will never spend a dime or any of my time ever again at this establishment, and I will not only discourage anyone that I know from coming here, but I will most definitely be telling the many people I come into contact with on a daily basis (I work in hospitality at a casino, as well as retail) just how much of a joke this place is.   Do not support a place that doesn't support people. Especially when we are the people putting money into your undeserving and unappreciative little pockets.    Carol, get your shit together!

I was here the first week they opened and the atmosphere was beyond what I expected.  Whoever marketed the grand opening was successful and I hope they can keep it consistent.  Especially after I went from a college atmosphere to cougarville at another establishment.  There were also curious attendees usually found in the Artifice scene, Insert Coins scene, people who just got off work, and casual tourists on Fremont.    The prices here is fair for it's surrounding competition.  And I pray to the beer Gods that they do not jack up the prices for drinks like other places have (last one I know of was Drink and Drag).    With all the contemporary artifacts, distractions, furniture, work equipment, and artwork inside this is one cool relaxing spot.  Those who are foreign to downtown Las Vegas and especially Fremont East will find that the music is loud, but if you've been here before then you'll know the Beauty Bar right next door and their outside live performances are the same.    The secret to loud music is that it makes you and your Russian comrade get closer or mingle closer together, you'll be loud after a couple drinks in anyway, or they're considerate for the people with hard of hearing.  But all things aside, this is a must stop by establishment during a pub crawl or if you're visiting downtown Vegas at night.  Upstairs will also feature live entertainment.  The upstairs open patio is a must steal spot when there's room.  Definitely one of my favorites due to the no strings attached gimmick that comes with the surrounding area.  Parking is easier than if you're visiting Fremont Street Experience and if you look at the back of the parking meters they'll let you know what time you don't need to feed it.

CW is a nice addition to Fremont East and the staff that I dealt with was actually pretty cool.   I arrived just after 10 on Saturday night. There was a short line outside that moved quickly. A good amount of people were already crowded around tables and the seats were full but it was by no means  packed.  Fast forward a few hours to around midnight. The people standing 2 and 3 deep at the bar waiting for drinks were backed up against the people seated and standing around the long table in the middle of the room. There was no traffic flow and everyone was at a stand-still. A good bar with a good floor-plan, has good traffic flow. It took me a while to make my way to the restroom and when I did manage to fight my way through the crowd there was a line out the door. Chatting with all the other inebriated ladies waiting to pee is always a good time but a line that snakes outside the bathroom door, I can do without.   The beer is far from cheap and I am, after all, a beer girl. The drinks looked yummy and the cocktail people in our group seemed to be enjoying them. They do offer lots of good choices in the way of beer. Lots of draft and bottles that you may not find at other bars in the area. It's great for me because I prefer to pay a little more money for craft brew or imports than to save a few bucks choking down domestic  bud lights.  Having said that...$10 for a 12oz bottle of moose drool, wtf? At Total Wine in Boca Park a 6pk of Moose Drool is $7.99. I get up-charging for alcohol in bars and restaurants. You have to pay more to have a drink with friends in a fun social setting. You pay for the service, the company, the music and the ambiance. I get that. What I don't get is charging $10 for a single 12oz  bottled beer that retails for $1.35. This is Vegas but Commonwealth is not a Strip property.  We're on Fremont for Pete's sake.

Apparently, from the looks of the crowd and the line outside, I'm the only one who thinks the beer is expensive, unless everyone else is ordering cocktails.

It's generally more relaxing and has a quieter vibe. It screams speakeasy to me, which is what I've been told the owners were going for The upstairs is where it gets a bit more raucous.

The drinks were a  little bit pricey, one beer was $8 and mixed drinks were like $12.

They have a  salad bar  menu, where all of the drinks use 9 fresh ingredients, so it takes a minute to read through. I ordered our drinks and was told they had already given last call, but she would make them anyways. While she was muddling or drinks, the music stopped, lights went on, and the bouncers started pushing people towards the stairs. A bouncer told us we needed to move out, and I told him our drinks were STILL BEING MADE. When I asked the bartender what time they close, she said 1:30. I asked what time it was, she said 1:28. So I followed up with what time did they do last call, she says 1:20. WTF? My friend asked about our drinks, she said we could take them with us. No sh*t. But since you can't go into any other bars with an outside drink, she protested a little and requested we be able to drink them there, to which the bartender responded that the downstairs was still open, and a bouncer returned.  Hey ladies, the bar is closed and you need to move on. How was your evening?  @@#%$$^%$$$#&&%!!!!!!!!!

When we hit the landing on the stairs, we could see that the lights were on and the house was empty, just like upstairs, and he  walked with us  right out the front door.  This was obviously a concerted effort by all employees to make the sale regardless of customer satisfaction or experience. I've worked in clubs, so I know that when we hit the front door, the doorman knew that the bar was closing down.

When you come here, you MUST try the banana bread beer.  It is soo good.  Strong hints of banana bread flavor and not sweet, so it's great.  It's served in a large glass.

Located in Fremont East right next to Le Thai, locals have another bar they can hop to during the course of the evening.  Get your ass inside and find a beautiful, expansive space with plenty of seating.  Admire the art and lighting while enjoying a craft beer or fancy cocktail.  Or, better yet, admire the beautiful bartenders pouring your drinks.  I was thoroughly digging on the boys in suspenders.  There is also an outdoor patio area upstairs if you want to smoke or enjoy the view of Downtown.  I believe there is another bar up there as well.  To get an idea for drink prices, my husband ordered a draft beer (Alley Cat Amber, which was really good) and I had a well drink.  They came out to be about $7 a piece.  Someone next to us ordered a sidecar (that looked yummy) and theirs was $9.  The crowd was diverse and included hipsters, cool kids, and quite a few guys dressed in suits.  Everyone was friendly and enjoying their time at Commonwealth.  Someone even bought the bar a round of shots (before it got too crowded, of course).  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the crowd stays the way it is and doesn't get overrun with bros.  We got in around 9:00 or 9:30 (on a Saturday) and it wasn't too busy and we were able to find a seat at the bar.  An hour later, however, was a completely different story.  There were wall-to-wall people and standing room only.  Depending on if you want to just chill or you're out to mingle, you should keep this in mind.  What made me fall in love with this place so much?  Was it the gorgeous atmosphere?  Was it the friendly crowd and staff?  Was it because they stole my iPod to create their music playlist?

Here's how your staff treats people, management included:  The second time I popped in for a drink I encountered the rudest bartender I have come across in ten years of living in Vegas. She treated me as if  I was the biggest inconvenience to her night because I had a question about a cocktail. She chatted with her other bartenders cheerfully but couldn't muster the energy to act like she enjoyed serving customers. She intentionally skipped me because I was being indecisive about a cocktail (uh, yeah, they ain't cheap by the way). The same night we were sitting at a table on the patio and we had extra chairs because other tables were unoccupied. The security guard came up to us and said that we were going to have to  get up  because they needed the chairs. Okay, fair enough, we know we had chairs that belonged to other tables but is that how you ask someone? Wouldn't you advise the customer politely that there are other parties being seated instead of saying  you guys have to get up . They sat a party for bottle service as if it would help them make the bottom line for the evening and no one else mattered.   My recent visit to Commonwealth (well, can't exactly qualify since they denied me entry) had me scratching my head. Our friends were inside CW so we were going to go in and meet them ( I did not particularly want to based on previous experiences). We were told the owner saw us do something outside and weren't allowed in because of it. I asked if we simply could know the reason why since I have patronized the business in the past. It's the least they could do is tell my why I was being denied. The manager, Brian, came out and then talked to one of the bouncers, Adam (cool dude by the way, no bad things to say about him, he actually understands customer service) and the managers first words to me were  what's up? Why are you being a prick? You asked to talk to me and you see that I'm right here.  Excuse me?????   Mr/Mrs. Owner, if this is the people you entrust to run your bar, you are either not involved or don't give a crap or both.   Yelpers, maybe you want to stop in for a drink at a new downtown spot and that's fine. Do not expect friendly staff and know that they think everyone is a potential douchebag.

Good beer and drink selection too.  It really could be called the crown jewel of the  new downtown .  Too bad you ruined it by running it like a douchey club that interferes with a patron's ability to relax and charges ridiculous prices.  The space you built is exceptional -- quirky design mixing elements of a lounge and upscale European chateau with laidback couches, chandeliers, a rooftop patio with an open air bar.  The drink selection is excellent -- great selection of beers and some nice creative cocktails.  After 5 minutes in your business, I thought it was a solid 5 star rating all the way.    But why . . . why are you running this place like a douche magnet?  Why the hell would you build a lounge-like pub and then refuse to let people sit on the weekends without paying for  bottle service ?  Seriously.  Why the hell would locals ever frequent a place where they can't sit down without paying 1000% mark up on a bottle of liquor?  And putting a velvet rope outside with a bouncer to control access to your bar?  What the hell?  And no happy hour?  And no prices on the beer menu?  That's not classy.  It's just annoying.

A piece of advice: in 6 months to a year when you're not the hip new kid on the block anymore and start to notice that your bar is pretty much empty until 9 pm (like Insert Coins), start making changes to encourage locals to be repeat customers: 1) Get a happy hour, 2) lose the stupid velvet rope, 3) let people sit down without buying $100+ of liquor.  Treat your customers like you want them there and don't just want to bilk them out of their money.  Start trying to earn their money by having an inviting bar and you'll bring the locals in.

Here's what happened, my boyfriend ordered from the male bartender (bearded with a manbun) and asked for a corona, bearded with a manbun bartender was standing next to tall, blonde bartender and whispers something and he goes off somewhere else, so we assumed bearded with a manbun bartender told tall and blonde bartender to get my BFs corona. So tall and blonde bartender asks my bf,  are you okay? And he says,  yeah I just ordered a corona from him.  She then hands him a corona and says  $8  so of course we paid her, the next thing you know bearded with a manbun bartender tells us  it's not okay to order from two different bartenders therefore you have to pay another $8.  Which I then told him,  no, because he didn't order from her. He ordered from you, we thought you told her to get his corona. So we paid her.  So then he threatens to kick us out, and says,  I'm going to look at the video and if I see him ordering from her, I'm kicking you two out.   So I guess, simply talking to another bartender means you're ordering twice now a days?! I told him to go ahead and look, all we know is that he didn't order from her even though she claimed he did. And he then continues to call the body guard who was extremely rude and told us to  get the hell out . And shoved me, mind you, I was in heels and the floor was slippery. You guys could've gotten a lawsuit against you if I slipped. Ruined our night, never coming back again.

First, for being a bar that will primarily attract locals, the prices on drinks are highly comparable in price to the inflated prices at nightclubs. Not a lot of bang for your buck either, in my experience. Second, it gets insanely packed, again you feel at times that you are in a nightclub.

It's ABOUT FUCKING TIME I was able to overspend for a drink and mingle with douchenozzles in ascots and Morrissey glasses...what took you so long, downtown Vegas?! Is there any way I can get a punchcard -- mortgage your house 10 times to buy drinks, get one percentage point free? Where do I sign up?????  I'm on the fence about all this downtown boosterism, but on the whole, progress is good... so I went in to support the new local bar. Sure, it SCREAMS douchetown from the outside...but I did go in with an open mind, I swear.  I bit my tongue while navigating the thug mooks manning the velvet rope out front (!). I bit it again when I shelled out $10 for a drink that costs 1/3 that right across the street. But after hanging out at this place for 3 hours, I ain't biting it no more.  So many annoying things about this place. There are these weird sort of security-types loitering around inside who can't/won't answer your simplest questions. The whole fuckin' reason I went here was to check out the upstairs patio, but it was closed. Why? No one knew. I wanted to order one of the hot drinks that are labeled  upstairs  drinks, so wanted to know if they were available though the patio is closed. No one knew. Finally found out from the waitress that they were NOT available, so ordered one of their corny specialty drinks...and it was served incomplete, without the special garnish that is an INTEGRAL PART of the drink. If you're gonna charge exorbitant prices for  mixology  drinks, at least make 'em right!!   The other annoying aspect is the music -- it's so LOUD! My vocal chords were seriously strained after spending a couple hours here, trying to chat with my date. And that was before the DJ even started up!  Speaking of the DJ, he was the only cool thing about this joint. I expected a douchey hipster type, but he turned out to be an awesomely frumpy older dude with a beer gut, Coke-bottle glasses and stringy, balding hair. He looked more like a children's party clown/secret child molester than your average DJ, and for that I give him MAJOR props.  I actually do genuinely love this bar.......because it keeps all the pretentious assholes in one place, so I don't have to deal with them elsewhere on Fremont St.  So enjoy that $10 jizz fizz, asswad -- I'll be across the street. I'd rather drink among degenerate bluehairs in a smoke-filled casino bar ANY DAY! Hell, I'd rather drink Thunderbird out of a paper bag in the old Ambassador parking lot with that Santa Claus wino....GUARANTEED to be more fun than shouting til your vocal chords are raw with the stuck-up asswads in Commonwealth!  UPDATE 10/2015:  This is just the way it is on East Fremont these days -- my original chagrin was mostly due to shock; there had never been a place like that downtown before. Now, sadly, I'm used to paying over $10 a drink down there...so I can't fault this joint for its prices. But since the place is mostly packed with fake hipster bros, I can still choose to avoid it!  I DID, however, come back one night because a friend had reservations in the Laundry Room, a sort of secret bar-within-a-bar. i don't think you're supposed to really write about it (no photos were allowed in there), but I have to admit that the Laundry Room is pretty cool. It's much quieter than the main bar, much more intimate and a genuinely interesting place to booze. Drinks were surprisingly reasonably priced (compared to what I expected), and I definitely feel that this experience is worth the price.

If you and your group are lucky enough to score seats usually servers will come around and get your order directly from you which is convenient, plus you can pay them and just hangout wait for your drinks and they bring them right too you. Another cool feature about this hipster bar is the rooftop area. If open, it is a really cool view of one of the main streets downtown and people watching from up there is second to none.   The interior is fancy for the area, complete with couches, chandeliers and single chairs. It is a bit pricey for what you get as far as a beer or cocktail, up to you if the hipster atmosphere is worth that price tag or not. If $8-10 dollars is expensive to you I would venture elsewhere. Also beware of the staff- I have heard multiple locals negative encounters with security being pushy and throwing people out for no reason, as well as bartenders being slow on purpose, being rude to customers and taking money but not serving their drinks, ect when they get crowded. I personally have not experienced this, but for the location and usual type of clientele (ahem tourists) I would not be shocked at all by this behavior.  I have come here multiple times with a group of friends as a casual, relaxed place to start drinking and hangout. Sometimes it can be empty (early in the evening) which is nice for your group so you can actually hear each other speaking (versus other places in the area that blast the music so loud you can't even think).

We arrived a bit after 9:30pm and it wasn't crowded.  We were able to move around freely.  After looking at the menu, I was surprise that the prices were decent...or so I thought because when I made a comment that wow, this drink is only $10 (in my surprise voice), Nate said  Earl, you need to take her out more often.   I was totally comparing the prices to Jaleo's and Rose.Rabbit.Lie's prices and anything less than those places I would think is good, due to the fact that those were the only 2 places that I ever remembered reading the drink prices.    Both Annie and I settled for the Moscow Mule.  It was DEE-LICIOUS.  Then a kind staff pointed to an area where we may lounge around.  After a while, we decided to hit up the rooftop patio.  It was a bit chilly at first but after warming up under the heat lamp and Moscow mule kicking in, I warmed up.  Well, my face was red but that didn't stopped me from accepting another Moscow Mule from Annie.  Um um um..yummy I tell ya.  This night was the most I have drank in a long time.    The vibe was great.  We liked it because people can be as dressy, or as casual as they please.  The music blazing on the rooftop was pretty awesome too.  There was a mix of everything.  People can dance if they want to as well.  The only minus I would say is that we had a table but we were somewhat scooted away since the bouncer or whoever he was suppose to be, was flashing his flashlight and lead a group of people to the table that we were surrounding.

The drink that I had was good but Velveteen Rabbit makes better drinks for less.  Then when the bill came she threw it down and walked away.  Dana double charged my credit card for what I don't even know.  Then as I was leaving she got bouncers involved saying I didn't pay my bill.  Clearly she's on drugs or hates waiting on people.

Beautifully designed, The Commonwealth exudes an aura of class. Decorated in rich woods, there are 20s & 30s photographs plastered along the far wall and chandeliers hanging in the middle.  There is an upstairs but we didn't check it out. We were busy sitting at the bar watching Vinny work his magic. Watching a good bartender go to work is a lot of fun and Vinny definitely falls under that category. My companion had the Irish Jackass & the Kentucky Squeeze and they were incredible. I usually don't care for whisky drinks myself but these were delicious. Beautifully concocted. I've seen people complain about the prices but to me, they were in line with what I've paid for at similar bars in Los Angeles. I'll  definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas and will definitely try my luck in the Laundry Room.", "Date": "2015-04-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "pXW37N9iL-hDGZ48Ko-s_A", "Overall": "5", "Content": "If you love beer(I love beer!!), cool cocktails and a great atmosphere then Commonwealth is the place to be.

There is no justification for a cover charge on Fremont Street. We were on the upstairs patio most of the time, and it was teeming with the standard Downtown crowd. I went here just to see what all the buzz was about, and will not likely be going back unless it's during a reasonably priced drink special night.

It's location, it's decor, and a few of its unique characteristics have enticed me into returning many times since its opening.  First, its located in downtown east Fremont st, a new hub of independent bars rivaling for the attention of the Vegas nightlife.  I've been a supporter of this area for years - since it was just two or three lonely bars on a nearly deserted street corner.  Since then, its exploded into a culture scene for those looking to avoid the small culture and high drink prices of the strip.  The Commonwealth is a welcome addition here.  It's exterior and interior are really unique, and a high selling point for the bar.  When inside or outside on the patio upstairs, you don't necessarily feel like you're in Las Vegas at all.  Just a really cool pub.  The photos on the walls, the paint and furniture, and even the peacock them all over the wallpaper, really bring this pubs classic feel together.  That brings up the patio - one of the bars best attributes!  It features a large outdoor patio with its own bar that overlooks East Fremont.  You can party with your friends and have some entertainment watching those below.  It really increases the bars draw.  Another plus is its speakeasy hidden inside, which really offers a unique experience.    There's only one major negative - its large crowd.  This can sometimes be a good thing, with a happening crowd having a great time and creating a wonderful party atmosphere.  But this can also be a bad thing.  On one Friday night, there was a DJ indoors that attracted a very sketchy crowd that didn't seem to fit the bars vibe at all.  And there was a huge line out the door causing a lot of commotion.  Still, overall, great place to hang out and a lot different than the strip atmosphere.", "Date": "2013-03-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Tim", "ReviewID": "KKmKwC4l8MjRR4HMPHxShg", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Was here for the fist time last night for a birthday party.

When I go to downtown Las Vegas I don't expect to pay Strip prices especially when it is a bar and not a club.  Be prepared to wait in line to enter and wait in line to go up to the roof (which is the best spot) and pay cover if you are male (luckily females are free).  Also be prepared to spend $8-$10 for a beer.  In my opinion the beer selection does not warrant that price range.   Price aside this place is really fun and has a Hipster vibe. It sort of reminds me of Austin. Lots of beards, plaids, and tattoos.  The music ranges from hip hop to EDM and dance battles happen often on the roof.  Also if you call ahead you can make reservations for the  laundry room  which is a private room that fits about 15 people comfortably.  Inside there is a bartender who makes speciality craft drinks that cost even more!  Overall one of the more fun bars in downtown but you can find same drink selection cheaper across the street.", "Date": "2015-01-09", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
