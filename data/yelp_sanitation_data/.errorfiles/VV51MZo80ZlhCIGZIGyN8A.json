It was definitely pretty crowded with lots of families out for a beautiful sunny Saturday. Several vendors selling a variety of things, only 3 actual vegetable stands all from California.   I ate the Hawaiian chicken plate from Diamond Head Grille. They had run out of rice and cran mac so it was just a hawaiian roll, yet they still charged full price which was disappointing. The chicken was ok, nothing special.  I did also end up buying an artichoke cheese dip and also some homemade jam. Both of these are really good.   They have a nice playground area for the kids, and all sorts of face painting and photos and other stuff going on. Parking was packed, I ended up parking over near REI and walking across. Overall a nice way to spend a couple hours on a beautiful sunny day.", "Date": "2014-11-11", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Nelson", "ReviewID": "DOy5TEPnHgKsReNT7JdS-w", "Overall": "3", "Content": "YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(307/365)  Throwdown At Tivoli!   'TIS THE SEASON! It's that time of the year again! The Fresh 52 Farmer's Market's Autumn Harvest Festival is a time where everyone comes out  to Tivoli Village in Summerlin to say  Buh-bye!  to the hot summer months and  Long Time No See!?!?' to the arrival of Autumn...  FOOD AND FUN FOR EVERYONE! Live music, culinary artistry and food demos from the chef instructors and students at CSN (What up Tien!) Petting Zoo from Roos N More for all the kids to enjoy, and all of the different produce, arts, crafts, shops, and food you could ever feast your eyes on!  SHUT YOUR PIE HOLE! The Annual Pie Eating contest co-sponsored by Yelp is one of the highlights for the festival, and Yelp Las Vegas CM Nate M. did a great job of gathering a bunch of brave souls to battle with a mixed berry pie with $100 going to the winner. The dude from Jo-Jo's Jerky won it for a 3-peat, and  Niyen took third this time out. Props also go out to Trev for his efforts! This scene reminded me of a VERY mellow memory of the movie Stand By Me, without the barf-o-rama part! Everyone looked like they had a blast and everyone walked away with cool Yelp swag bags.  See you next year!  ALOHA!!!

They have live performers, fruit and ice carvers displaying some really nice arrangements, and so much more.  The aromas of fall and harvest are in the air with several food vendors including CCSN's culinary students serving up some of their seasonal items like risotto and fruit and vegetable smoothies.   Yelp, along with Fresh 52s Market hosts the yearly pie eating contest which is so much fun to watch.  Participants were provided with blueberry or strawberry pies some yelp plastic ponchos and off they went eating their way to the finish line. And the verdict, a 2 year pie eating champion is still undefeated taking home the grand prize of $100!  There are quite a few stands offering everything from gluten free baked goods, jewelry and beautiful looking produce.  The only complaint would be the steep pricing and I heard this from quite a few people today. We need more farmers markets yes, however I really think they would be more successful if their pricing was more reasonable and comparable.    Overall a great time spent welcoming the fall and harvest!", "Date": "2014-11-13", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Nate", "ReviewID": "-zetBAS5l2FTuWMWGBurag", "Overall": "4", "Content": "It's like a Farmers Market on steroids.  Tons of food vendors and people hawking their homemade goods and crafts. I have to be honest and I wasn't able to try most of things here, but I did partake in the  Green Juice Bar ,  JoJo's Jerky , and the fresh squeezed lemonade stand.   The juice was very good and gave me that much needed boost of energy when there was no coffee to be found, even though it was a little pricey. JoJo's Jerky was delicious as per usual, and you can't go wrong with fresh strawberry lemonade made right in front of you.  Then there was the pie eating contest. An insanity laiden event with fifteen people eating blackberry pie with no hands, faces only. It was really quite a scene. Why enter this crazy pie eating situation, how about for a $100 cash prize. Yup, and the reigning champ ended up winning, 3 years strong. One whole pie in under 20 minutes.   Great stuff for the both foodie and and craft lover inside of you.", "Date": "2014-11-10", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Sunny", "ReviewID": "aBv3_VAdfhpCBn7a7yUrOQ", "Overall": "3", "Content": "This was our first visit to the Harvest Festival, I gotta say it's the most crowded that I have ever seen Tivoli Village.  We're usually at Tivoli Village about once a month or so and its almost always super desolate, I often wonder how some of the businesses stay afloat.  They just opened up a Restoration Hardware gallery there which we were excited about, so the visit worked out well.  They had a farmer's market going on w/ lots of fresh produce along w/ a bunch of miscellaneous vendors from tarot card psychic readers to homemade soaps and a few food trucks.  My 3yr old absolutely loved playing all the free carnival type games, they had a large number of them going on where they gave little trinkets at each of the stations, win or lose, which was really sweet.  They did have a teeny tiny petting zoo, which I found to be VERY sad cause the animals looked so unkept and the area was right next to speakers blaring excessively loud music.  Probably kinda frightening and uncomfortable for the animals.  Aside from the sad petting zoo, we enjoyed our day at the Harvest Festival.", "Date": "2016-10-30", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Pat", "ReviewID": "IYouD-Ic17kC_mP66u5RKw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "l", "Date": "2015-11-03", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
