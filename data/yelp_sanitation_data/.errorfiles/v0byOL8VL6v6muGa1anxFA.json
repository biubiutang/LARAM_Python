When we walked in no one was there to sit us, I waited for a minute and then decided just to take a seat. However, once I went to sit down someone came out to help us. Not horrible, just awkward! The music also sounded a little like a Bollywood/slasher flick combined. There were moments it was terrifying and moments where it was fun and upbeat. There were several times I remarked to my date  do you hear this music?    Once we sat everything was pretty impressive. Our drinks were refilled on the regular. The first things that came out were the tabouli, pita bread, and eggplant fries with a side of Mediterranean butter. The fries came in a giant bowl. It was a lot more than we expected. They were good, but I preferred the zucchini fries that came later. The tabouli was citrusy/minty and delicious. The pita bread was puffy, like two slices of pita were stuck together and filled the middle with air. It wasn't bad, just not what I am used to. I actually may have liked it more because it felt  lighter.    The next appetizer that came out was Hollaum Cheese ant was fantastic. It comes out with three pieces of fried Lebanese cheese and cut up tomatoes, cucumbers, and pickles. It's $12, so I do have to say it is expensive for what you get. I wish it had at least four pieces of cheese. However, it was certainly my favorite dish of the night, and if you love cheese it is a must try!   Then our entrees came out, with my dates coming about 10 minutes after mine which was weird but forgivable. I had an entree size of the Greek salad, and it was HUGE. It was also incredibly unique. It had all the regular trappings of a Greek salad but also a little ZING. I don't know what gave it the kick at the end, but I ended up trading it for my partners beef shwarma. He LOVED the salad. The shwarma was eh. We subbed rice for zucchini fries - it was a good choice. Try something else tough.  I'm coming back to try those carrot fries!", "Date": "2016-11-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Lindsay", "ReviewID": "GeqUNbqX20EhakBSOzDT6w", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I love this place. It is m y go-to lunch spot when I need a break from work. I have also gotten food to go to eat at my desk. The food is delicious and I usually get two meals out of it given the amount of food they give you.  My go-to order is the shawarma plate. The chicken shawarma is delicious and I love the tahini sauce with it. Along with the rice and veggies, you get quite the meal out of it. Also, it comes with a side which I always get the fatoosh salad. Best salad on the planet!   Even better is their pita bread. It is warm and delicious, but they can't make it fast enough. This is part of the reason I am giving them four stars as opposed to 5. Another reason is because of the service. They are very friendly, but they are FAR too busy to have only one waitress working during the lunch shift. I was bragging about this place to my co-workers and brought them in one day and the service was so slow and we were having to wave down the waitress for more drinks and pita bread. It was kind of embarrassing for me.

I usually don't like cucumbers but their cucumber salad was wonderful!! Feta and olives were great.    We both had the falafel sandwich.  While I wasn't a huge fan of the kimchi, the falafel was perfect.  I opted for the zucchini fries which were a great upgrade option and well worth it.  Many places use frozen fries but these are made fresh with a light batter and great dipping sauce.  While I was gorged from the meal our server recommended a baked custard in puff pastry.

The chef here is a master of the falafel - this is not a simple achievement. One bite and you will be spoiled. The *only* other falafel in town that holds a candle to these are Amena Bakery's - and even so, you would never take a date to Amena. The Hummus Factory is the Total Wine of Mediterranean, and Amena is a downtown liquor store with a much smaller menu and barred windows (not really, but you know what I mean?) I can't think of anything that Amena does that The Hummus Factory can't do better.  Crazy good fresh hot pitas. Like should accompany your last-meal-on-Earth good. If you're going to cheat on your no-carb diet, you might as well do it here with absolutely no regrets.  They've also concocted the *best* Greek salad dressing of all time. And I was never one to be like,  Hmm, for lunch I'm feeling like a Greek salad...  But now I totally am. This Greek salad changes everything (see my Yelp photo) and it's a once-a-week choice for me when I'm in town.  All three items I've mentioned (the falafel, pitas, and Greek salad) are best-in-class in Las Vegas, and will set you up for disappointment when you order these things anywhere else. It's happened to me several times in the last month on the East Coast. Even my favorite Mediterranean place in Atlanta (where I lived for 7 years) is no longer good to me.

GET THE ZUCCHINI FRIES!!! It just melts in your mouth. Hands down my favorite thing there now.   As far as pricing it's within the $10-$18 price range and you get a good sized portion. Lunch and dinner prices differ so watch for that.  The lady who served us was very friendly and maintained amazing service the whole time. Wish we remembered her name, but she was a nice Asian lady.

The service is fantastic. The server (not sure what his name is) has a genuine smile and very polite. I always tip him very well because he works hard and truly deserves it.  Price range is pretty competitive with others in the city (example Paymon's). The decor is quite interesting as it doesn't read Mediterranean although it is very well kept and clean. I will say that my first visit during the summer almost killed me; the air conditioning either wasn't working or they just didn't turn it on to save on electricity. It was way too warm and I was sat way in the back of the restaurant by the back entrance when there was no one else in the restaurant.  The second time around it was still slightly warm but much cooler than the first time.    The eggplant and zucchini fries are huge portions and are cut slightly too big for my taste. I think they would be crispier if they were cut slightly smaller. The portions are big and remind me of CheeseCake Factory sizes, very rare to find this in Mediterranean restaurants.    Overall, I definitely recommend this place perhaps in the fall and winter when it's cooler unless they worked on the A/C system. The service is excellent, food is pretty consistent...Also, I happened to catch a wild Pickachu playing Pokemon Go in the restaurant as I waited for my food.

Two of us came here to share various items.  The restaurant had few customers at 5 PM on Friday night.  We ordered:  Factory hummus order and pita (free with Yelp check in) Falafel appetizer with fresh vegetables and tahini sauce Meat combination with one beef kabob, one kafta, one sujuk and one kibbi with baba ghanoush (susbstiution of zucchini fries for rice for an upcharge) Gyro sandwich (substitute eggplant fries instead of rice for an upcharge) Baklava Rice pudding Shabiet  I ordered an iced tea also and was brought refills several times without needing to ask.  I also asked if I could sample their ghost pepper sauce that you can get with hummus.  Our server, Nikki, brought a small cup of the sauce and warned me to only dip the pita in a little bit of the sauce.  That's what I did and immediately started hiccuping from the reaction to the heat of the ghost pepper.  I won't be eating that--it is very hot as I guessed it would be.  First off before trying the ghost pepper sauce, we were brought an order of hummus and very hot, house made pita bread.  Both were excellent.  The pita was so light and fluffy in texture.  It was with a small piece of the pita that I tries the ghost pepper sauce.  We also had a small round of butter that was flavorful with the pita.  Next up came the falafel appetizer.  Good falafels with good tasting tahini and a selection of fresh vegetables to go with the falafel.  Next came our two main courses.  One was a gyro sandwich with zucchini fries and one was the meat combination with eggplant fries and an order of baba ghanoush.  Of the fries, the eggplant were better to my taste although the zucchini were good, too.  Good gyro.  The meat combination was very good.  Standout on this dish was the sujuk--spicy sausage.  The spice was perfect for this meat.  We ended our meal with 3 desserts, baklava, rice pudding, and shabiet.  The baklava is much different than I've had before.  There is honey but it's not dripping or swimming in honey.  In addition, it's small in width and shaped like a piece of Kit Kat.  Very tasty and a different way of making it.  The rice pudding was quite creamy and very good and last, the shabiet with its ashta cream was very good.  The shabiet is shaped like a turnover and has this wonderful cream inside.  Part of my five stars also is for the service.  Our factory worker, Nikki, was really a pleasant woman who was quite interesting to speak with and she was always there to refill iced tea or my companion's water glass.  It's quite a story that this brick and mortar restaurant came about after its start as a food truck restaurant.", "Date": "2016-08-27", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Shari", "ReviewID": "hhkv1uXH8v6xIbNB754LVA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "The jalapeño hummus is FABULOUS.

The Hummus Factory, Hedary, Paymons, Zaytoon, Maza, and some others are located within the same general area, in some cases within a few blocks of each other. The Hummus factory menu is very similar to Hedary, so I ordered what I often get at Hedary:  Kafta skewers and lentil soup.  I have no complaints about what I got. It was good, but it wasn't as good as Hedary. The rice was OK but not as good as Hedary's (which is excellent). The pita bread, too, was good and fresh, but not as good as Hedary. Hedary is just a couple of blocks away from Hummus Factory, so I'll go there. To respond to owner's comment: I agree with your reference to Chinatown, so maybe the congregation of Mediterranean restaurants is a similar concept. However, regardless of the origination of the recipes, if you choose to locate your restaurant a few blocks from Hedary's, and maintain a similar menu, you should expect your restaurant to be compared directly to Hedary's.

I said  you're out of hummus at the hummus factory?  - totally meant to be funny and sarcastic, but she felt so terrible about it. She told me she'd remember me for next time since I already put down that I used the free hummus coupon. Next thing you know the chef/owner comes out to let us know he can make hummus for us, but it will take about 10 mins. 10 mins later he brings it to us and apologizes that it would taste better if it was refrigerated (allowing the flavors to marinate as the hummus cools).   Honestly, it is one of the best hummus I've ever had. It tasted fresh (obviously) and it was delicious and creamy. I'd recommend their hummus to everyone. Homemade hummus is the best hummus.   Their pita - so delicious, chewy and really fresh. I love pita and always find Mediterranean restaurants use packaged pita or day old pita and it always leaves my mouth feeling dry. Their pita is served with their house-made butter which is very herbaceous. A+.  Their chicken shawarma - it really actually tasted like chicken fajita. Don't get me wrong, I love fajita so I really didn't mind, but I honestly wouldn't call that shawarma to be honest. It was still delicious though! Just wish it had more Mediterranean spices.  Their fried zucchini - could use some time in the oven. Some of it came to us pretty soggy, but the breading was delicious. Their aioli was really good as well!  Their baba ganoush - nice tartness to it. I loved the taste and the portion was pretty good! It tasted good with the fries.  I ordered their chicken shawarma plate and got fries (+$1.95) instead of their rice. The fries worked well with the hummus. I wish I had garlic sauce. That would have been top notch.

Paired with the Factory Hummus,  it's even better.  The falafel appetizer is generously portioned and perfectly crisp. The veggies underneath offset the density that falafel can sometimes have. I had the beef schwarma sandwich. Once there was a tad too much tahini, but I scraped the excess away to make it better. The kafta is evenly seasoned and was mild enough for my son to eat too.  If I had to find fault with one thing, they plate so much vegetables - lettuce, cucumbers, etc. - on most of their dishes, that I feel like they could save some money giving a little less. I love my veggies, but i don't think their customers would notice or mind if they held back a little.  Our lunch waiter was extremely attentive but not hovering.

Bearing no association to Hummus Factory's elsewhere, the restaurant owned by Tabet and his wife's only  relation  being that the Chef's Aunt brought Khoury's Mediterranean to Las Vegas several years ago, The Hummus Factory occupies a lengthy space just West of Buffalo Drive and with seating for a tepproximately eighty stretching backward from a foyer flanked by a bar that displays the open kitchen the restaurant takes on a sort of non-descript feel that does little to convey its ethnicity by way of several pieces of art designed by the owners themselves, the music a bit more appropriate to the style of the menu, though at times the chants or singing do become a touch too loud.  Serving large portions across the menu, Mrs. Tabet acting as Maitre D' and waitress explaining that the goal was to feed people as it is done back home, prices trend  higher than most of the Valley's Mediterranean options in part due to the fact that almost everything offered is meant for sharing, the ability to order samplers and substitutions a welcome addition for those who do not wish to fill up on rice with the average cost for a meal-for-two probably somewhere in the range of fifty dollars.  Dining as a duo with a goal to sample widely from sections ranging from dips and salads to sandwiches and entrees, it was with a few questions asked that the order was settled, a substantial three-course tasting comprised of approximately nine items with an all-in cost of just under $90.  Beginning with house-made Pita, certainly one of the best in the city with four fluffy puffs per basket, round one consisted of the restaurant's eponymous dish that offers a creamy base with light herbs gently slicked in Olive Oil with an underlying bit of Citrus, the oddly spelled  Falafil  appetizer getting away from the neon green hues of some with a dense nuttiness that plays well off Tahini and housemade Pickles, the Baba Ganoosh another great flavor that does wonders for anything it is spread on by adding its satin texture as well as a touch of smoke.  Chuckling at the ridiculousness of Ghost Peppers, perhaps 1/8tsp causing a spontaneous cough and hiccupping fit from one at the table, it was with palates ready that more meaty options arrived for round two of the evening, the Gyro relatively standard fare flanked by gently fried slices of Zucchini (a $2.95 addition) that paired well with the sweet n' savory  Pink Sauce,  while the Combination Plate was a far more fulfilling option highlighted by Spicy Sujuk and reference standard Kibbi alongside Eggplant fries that will leave all but the most strong-willed picking at them until the pile is reduced to nothing.  Offering three desserts, each charged $6.95 with everything, again, made in-house, The Hummus Factory's Baklava is quite different from the standard in that each of the five fingers is only lightly touched in sweetness and thus extremely crunchy with a focus on the Walnuts and strips of Phyllo, a more traditional Rice Pudding dialing up savory notes with Rosewater and Cinnamon playing off Pistachios while the warm Shabiet happily steals the spotlight by way of creamy Custard tucked inside layers of crisp Pastry beneath a veil of Nuts and Honey.  ****Priced a bit steeply for what it is, though taking the time to do everything from scratch no doubt warrants a premium for labor as well as skill, The Hummus Factory proves that the transition from Truck to Restaurant remains as possible as ever in the current restaurant climate, though the space itself could still use a bit of work before it feels like it has a true identity while dishes better suited for solo diners would be welcomed as well.", "Date": "2016-08-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Kristine", "ReviewID": "jB0jgbSoEuduIIILH582Sg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Sahara has every average fast food chain, it's awash I.

The place wasn't pack when we got there, it was lunch time on a Monday. The facade is homey and everything is clean. The staff was friendly and very accommodating. Now, to the food. The bread/pita: goodness! See, here's the thing, my S.O. has had always this endearing issue that his food must be always hot when it get's to him. Whenever he see  his order, he actually count the minutes on how long it was there on the counter before serving it to him and if it's lukewarm or col to his  standards  he will not be happy. And this bread/pita, burned his fingers. He was so happy.  I loved the baba ganoush for my appetizer. Creamy and savory, the perfect pair for the bread. while my S.O. ordered Greek Fries, and goodness was it good and was it plenty. Served in a deep bowl, with feta crumble, it was good hot, crispy and fantastic! The tzatziki, or the cucumber sauce/gyro sauce was a perfect accompaniment for the fries.George, our server, recommended the pink sauce for it, and yes he was spot on. For the main dish, I ordered the Gyro sandwich with egg plant fries. It was fantastic, especially the egg plant fries. Crunchy, light and creamy, amazing. The Gyro sandwich was great as well. Filling but not heavy. My S.O. went for the pretzel sliders which he adored and again was served with an abundant serving of fries.  After about 20 mins, we're so stuffed that we had to have three boxes, which was great for dinner.   i went the second time with my sister, and this girl is in love with their Dolmas and Majadra. Again, I must relieve the craving for the Egg plant fries and pink sauce. Also the Mini Mezza was plenty for a comfortable filling dinner.

The food choices are wider than most Lebanese restaurants, offering more than the traditional menu offered everywhere. The quality is good and close to authentic, but since my previous visit, I had to change my opinion a little:  First, after a long wait, I received my order first; I thought the other two are on the way. As a courtesy, I decided to wait for my friend's food to arrive. By the time it arrived (20 mns later!), my food was cold and I could not enjoy it. Not only that, but I ordered the Beef Shawarma, and to my shock, I see what looked like thin slices of steak, instead of shredded beef as it is traditionally (and the ONLY way) served. When I tried it, it did not even taste like shawarma; the spices were not even close to the real thing. I have to say I was very disappointed, especially that I had a good experience on my previous visit, and the owner/chef is Lebanese so there is no excuse for not knowing the proper way to serve shawarma as it is one of our iconic dishes. My friend who also ordered and loved the Soujouk last time ordered it again but this time it was not the same...I did not want to give a bad review because I know they will fix this, and the place, being new probably is still tweaking everything like any new business, Hopefully they will work on how to serve the shawarma properly if they want to claim to have authentic Lebanese cuisine. It would have been the right thing also to offer not to charge my order since both waitresses were aware that I could not enjoy my food being cold; I did not want to make a big deal of it, but any respectable restaurant would offer at least that or some alternative... Also I read from another review that they take too long to bring the bread and the owner's answer was that it is because it is served fresh to order. In my opinion, the bread's freshness should not affect the service or quality of the food, so unless they can maintain the same quality and handle the pressure of traffic (which I hope they will have), then you can serve regular pre-made bread until then. Most restaurants do that and nobody complains, because it it the food quality and service that counts at the end; the fresh baked bread should only be an added bonus, but not at the expense of important things, because people will not go just for the bread but the overall experience, in my humble opinion. One last thing:  food should NEVER be served that far apart; most people will not start eating unless everyone is ready, so this is more of an etiquette issue than quality of food. I personally would have preferred to wait the extra 20 mns and enjoy my food WITH my friends than to stare at it then eat it cold... Despite everything, I still love the place and wish the owner all the luck; like every new business, it takes time to make everything perfect. that's why there are good and bad reviews, because this is how you improve. The servers are very friendly and I know the food is too in general, so I will definitely go back there and hope that this was a one-time experience and look forward for my next visit. (But PLEASE do not serve the shawarma like slices of steak; it is the whole point of shawarma! :) ).  Sorry for the long review, I did not want to present a negative one without giving the place the credit it deserves in other areas, I cannot wait to go again soon and give a much better rating!!", "Date": "2016-11-27", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Amelia", "ReviewID": "df8KBGOh0_g-Li1olMgF-A", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Ok so this sucks that I have to give them 2 stars I would love to give them 5 but unfortunately due to a lack of customer service and not with the servers but more management so I have come in here atleast 6 times and I will say I love the food it's amazing haven't had a bad thing but I brought my husband in with me about two weeks ago after leaving he realized he forgot his hat I called it had been no more than 10 mins since we left the women on the phone said yes we have it Ill put it up for you I informed her I wouldn't be in to pick it up for a week she said no problem and we hung up I came in less than a week later and she instantly recognized me and said oh your hat let me grab it when she went to get it where she left it she found it was gone she asked everyone that was at work if they moved it no one said they had the manger than got involved first trying to tell me we don't have your hat no one ever called us about it basically saying I was lying than I said no this women here remembers she informed him yes this is true he than asked for my number so he could ask around and call he called me back about 2 hours later but I was at work and couldn't answer I than called him that same day and left him a message only for him to never return my call I came in a week later to grab lunch and find out what happen to my hat they told me they no idea about a hat and they don't have it the manger didn't even come out to speak with me even though I saw he was there they didn't discount my meal as an I'm sorry we lost or stole your hat obviously it's just a hat I will replace it but I was treated like I was lying given the runaround and was never even giving an apology it sucks cause I really do love it here and the day waitress is so sweet but I just don't know if I can return to a place that treats their customers this way 2 stars are for the day waitress I wish I knew her name and the food is good but there is great food everywhere  in vegas how I'm treated matters", "Date": "2016-11-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jerry", "ReviewID": "PTxXPBpcPdDSFxdlg94bRA", "Overall": "3", "Content": "We went there for lunch.

Don't worry though, their menu isn't all healthy stuff- but it IS all tasty.  Highly recommend their salads- start at $10, add on protein separately. Price seems steep til you realize the portion could feed a whole family. The Greek with Falafel was literally all I ate one day, fresh and packed with olives. Add a side of hummus and pita, which comes out piping hot from the oven.   Went in another day for a chicken shawarma wrap- super moist with tons of tahini and grilled onions. For best results, upgrade to the eggplant fries, they're lightly battered and seasoned and frankly, life-changing. I dip them in straight Sriracha and dream of them. My guy loved the combination lunch plate(chicken and steak). The grilled onions on that are awesome too, and I like how they use a sauce and herbs in their rice to keep it from being the same generic white rice you get everywhere else in town. Meat and veggies were perfectly grilled.  Service is super friendly and treats you like a regular after just one visit. Food comes out fast and everything is super fresh.

In our former Med resto I only eat the pita and their grape seed oil and just share from my husband's order. The flavor of the chicken shawarma and the pink sauce combo plus the rice was so scrumptious I almost want to finish his meal. There was a white sauce Tatziki maybe for the shawarma but hubby liked the my pink sauce better. My eggplant fries was awesome too but I'd like it more crispy (personal pref) again pink sauce...the bomb!  This is a gem that I started telling my friends to try it while still in the restaurant. Verdict:  I'll be back!!! I now love Mediterranean food but only in this place from now on.  Thanks Tory for a great service!!!  We couldn't finish the big portions and wanted our daughter to have some. When she got home she already ate. If I still had space in my tummy I still wanted to finish it but that's gluttony.

Given the plethora of great Mediterranean restaurants in town, I give this one a pass.(3 starred review).  I feel bad about this review. I really wanted to like this place - the server and hostess are super nice and the ambience is clean and well kept. The problem rests with the execution of  the dishes. To be fair this place is supposed to be Mediterranean fusion so I don't now if the below comments are intentional or not.  We ordered the hummus (free with Yelp check in at time of review) which comes with freshly made pita bread, the chicken shawarma plate and the gyros sandwich plate with zucchini fries upgrade.  The hummus and pita are both good and a definite order if you go. The pita is lighter, fluffier version and served piping hot as it ought to be. The side salad that came with the chicken shawarma plate was very generous and fresh.  The entrées did not fare so well. Both proteins lacked caramelization. It was fairly obvious that the chicken shawarma was not roasted on a spit/oven in a traditional manner as it was pale and watery. I suppose it was like this when it was served seemingly sautéed with onions and tomatoes. Very strange and not what I expected when I order shawarma.   The hub's gyros has the same problem with the meat lacking the roasted flavor. His sandwich also had huge hunks (not slices) of tomatoes in it which overwhelms the meat in the sandwich.  (Oddly all the tomatoes used in our dishes were cut the same way.)  Zucchini fries were cut in a haphazard fashion leading to inconsistencies in texture (some were soggy) and uneven breading. Not worth the upgrade.  Although the service was good, the execution of the food is not worth a return visit. That being said, if you were to visit this restaurant, try to go for lunch as their prices are a little better than for dinner. 3 starred review", "Date": "2016-06-22", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Francis", "ReviewID": "Rl5p-4ZC79rhJdVnQwvHWg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Vegan grape leaves, fried egg plant and Baba Ganoosh were all fantastic.
