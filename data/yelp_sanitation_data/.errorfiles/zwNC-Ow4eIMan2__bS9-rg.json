Or possibly, my life.   Since Tacos el Gordo (one of the most popular) was a disappointment for me, I had given up half a year ago. IT's been a while, yeah.   I think this place has hands down the BEST Al Pastor Tacos. OH MY GOSH. I don't even really like Al pastor tacos, and prefer carne asada, but it was a smashing hit for me here, surpassing the other tacos available.   Al pastor tacos- 7/5 stars.  Carne asada tacos- 4/5 stars.  Shrimp tacos- 5/5 stars.  Mexican hot cocoa- 2/5 stars. It was chunky, had strange bits in it, and it tasted almost like they used lard or a different type of fat instead of milk.

Eating here reminds me of when I got out of school and all of us broke kids would pull our money together and buy as many tacos as we could afford. And although I've come a long way from that, I do still know where I came from.   The menu is super simple. It's divided up into stations depending on what you want to order. You just tell them what you want and they make it right in front of you. Hot and fresh!!!! Like I said, get pineapples with the al pastor tacos. Mind f***ing blowing!! Meat is tender and melt in your mouth. And when you add the pineapple, salt and sweet together, boom!!!! You just can't eat at Roberto's anymore. The most I could eat right now is 4, but I'm sure when my appetite is back to where it was, I can scarf down 10 with no problems.   Their condiment station is ridiculous. All the extras (cucumbers, radishes, carrots, etc) are always fresh and don't look like they've been sitting out for hours. There are multiple sauces to meet everyone's taste preferences! So good I came back the next day for seconds just to double check if it was really that good. And it was :)  Now here's my reason for the 4 stars and not 5. I ordered the Mexican corn (elote) and it was just eh. I'm used to the the guy honking the horn with his cart, walking the neighborhood streets in LA. That's my comparison and it didn't meet it. Even after the mayo, Parmesan cheese and chili powder, it was still bland. Guess I need to take a trip back to Inglewood just for the elote guy. Second, the line to pay can be a pain. You're standing there waiting and your food is getting cold. Boo!!! And the horchata is way to sweet. Had to add water to drink it.   But that's enough of the negatives. That's not enough to make me stop coming here. Now I don't have to drive to the other side of town for good eats. Now get your butt up and get some! Did you not see my pictures?!?!

I think we ended up with 14 because some meats are cooked differently. We also had two vampiros and two Jarritos soda (pineapple and lime). There is a free salsa and sauce bar. Try the creamy light green one, it cools off the spiciness from the tacos. Everything is delicious, I think everyone in Vegas should make a trip here. :) The cashier also told me that they will be opening up a new location on Eastern soon, can't wait!

The hype was real for Taco Y Taco and honestly I prefer several different but similar places for numerous reasons. When you first walk in you are at a cafeteria style counter where they make your food and put it on a tray for you to bring to the register. You have to go to different spots at the counter to order different things. This is probably my least favorite set-up for ordering in any restaurant I have been to, tacos or otherwise. Having never been there myself, if I hadn't had a regular customer of theirs with me, I could see myself being very confused.   After you get past the counter, the atmosphere is decent with large open windows and ample seating. Their horchata is to die for; I will give them that! It was probably the best I have tasted anywhere. I ordered a chicken quesadilla, a gran taco, and Mexican street style corn. For nearly seven dollars I expected the quesadilla to come loaded, but it only had meat and cheese. The taco was good, and corn was bomb.com. This is just a preference thing, but the tortillas were not greasy at all, and I want greasy tortilla when I eat Mexican deliciousness.   My final verdict is that if I were on this side of town already, I would stop by for a horchata and Mexican street corn snack but I wouldn't drive down here to eat like some people I know. My boyfriend says this place has the best lengua in town, and he will make a special trip for it.

There's a bowl/burritos/everything else station and then there's stations for tacos so make sure you're aware of that.

I had to check this place out because of all the positive reviews. I'm now a familiar face at Taco Taco Mexican Eatery.  This place has a very similar setup like Tacos El Gordo, but has a little more variety on the menu, a nice salsa station, and is much more spacious.   I like the fact that you can order rice bowls, burritos, and grandes tacos from their menu. I tried their rice bowl with the al pastor. I was hoping to get the al pastor straight from the roasting spit, but it was taken from a container from that station. The rice bowl was okay, but I know it could've tasted better if the al pastor was freshly cut off of that beautiful stack of heavenly marinated pork. The al pastor burrito was alright also. It had pinto beans and I think rice. I can't say that I was a fan. My all time favorites are still the regular $2 al pastor tacos topped with pineapple. While waiting for my order, I'm checking out the tripas just chillen in the next station. The homie cuts me a few samples. MMMMMM grimey. I ended up ordering a couple of tripas tacos also. Soon after getting your order, you will find yourself at the salsa station. There is quite a variety of sauces to choose from. Their pico de gallo combo'ed with their other hot sauces is the winner. Don't forget to get some onions and peppers at the salsa station. I was hoping to see an Orange Bang on tap in the establishment. They didn't have my favorite drank whenever I'm eating tacos. They did however carry the Mexican bottled Coca Cola. Sugar sweatened Coca Cola tastes just like how it used to taste like when I was a kid.

It was flavorless and stomach churning. Got chips and guacamole, again flavorless.  I decided, it's just another shitty mexican joint that I will drive past and ignore, like most.   A couple months go by, I hear they are opening multiple locations, I decided I must have missed something, so I went back for lunch this last weekend.  My wife and I got 2 Street corn on the cobs with  butter , chili powder and lime. Butter has quotes around it cause what they use, that shit is not butter. I got a pastor burrito and my wife got a rice bowl. We also got chips and guacamole and I got a coke.   First, the corn was forgettable, makes you appreciate the dude selling it on the street. My burrito was God awful, the pork tastes like it's seasoned with kool-aid packets, I took 2 bite and lost 100% of my appetite. One of the worst meals I had ever had.

I had the al pastor (spicy pork) and buche (pig gut), and both were phenomenal. Taco Taco is a (brace yourself) taqueria. Sure, there are some other options (i.e. burritos, bowls), but tacos are at the crux of this business, and business is good. As per taqueria etiquette, you walk up to counter and order directly from the cooks. Feel free to try the various meats they offer (the cook I dealt with gave me a try of the al pastor unprompted) before making your decision. After grabbing your grub, Taco Taco has a large, clean, and no-frills dining area. My only knock is that there are not more tacos in the name.

Until recently, trying to find veg-friendly, authentic, good Mexican food in this town was like going on a quest to find the Fountain of Youth.  It just didn't exist.  Sure, there were places that list  vegetarian  items on their menus, only to tell you that it's full of lard and chicken broth.  Then there are the tex-mex chain restaurants that are veg-friendly but about as authentic as this Italian-Hungarian girl making a burrito.  Taco Taco is The Fountain of Youth.  You have your choice of burritos, tacos, bowls, and salads.  Soy chorizo is available, but for more health-conscious vegetarians you can just stick with beans and veggies.  Speaking of beans, they aren't cooked in lard or pork!  Woot!  The burritos are large and can be stuffed with tons of ingredients.  The tacos have house-made tortillas that are cooked up the second you order them.  Now here comes a dilemma: do you get the burrito that fits tons of extras like rice and beans or do you go for the tacos with their delicious tortillas?  Life can be so cruel.  They also have some special items like soy chorizo tacos that have been grilled (crunchy like a taquito) and topped with spicy salsa and cheese.  Or there are breakfast burritos with potatoes.  Then there's the horchata and Jarritos among the many beverage options.  And did I mention they offer a salsa bar with radishes, pickled veggies, beans, and eight types of salsa??    Don't you worry, meat-eaters, there are plenty of options for you and I'm sure they are just as good as my soy chorizo.  Just a heads-up, if you follow them on social media you can stay up to date with specials they will throw from time to time, like 2-for-1 tacos on a random Saturday afternoon or a free corn for checking in.  The owners and all the employees are super friendly and helpful.  Despite being on the opposite side of town, I've managed to make the trip out here far too many times.  Rumor has it they are looking for a second location which can be bad news for me if it's near my all my downtown drinking establishments.  Expect me to be 50 pounds heavier if that's the case.

Thanks to Jamie W advice, Taco Taco was a major bookmark for the week, and it's only a hop, skip,  jump from Henderson.    Well, not a that short of a trip, but it's closer than driving to Charleston for a few real tacos.  Located at the northeast corner of Tropicana and Peco at the north end of the strip center, Taco Taco stands out pretty good because of the very bright lighting inside.   Also, the place look huge from the outside, but it's kind of narrow when you walk in.   Seeing the set up of the ordering area, I could see some problem in the future when they start getting busy.   Thankfully, I got there late on Sunday night, and in the dining room  was kind of packed, but everyone was already eating.    The place is set up like El Gordo, and you make your order at set stations for your order.   Unlike El Gordo, this places has more selection on the menu board, which was nice to see.     I ended up ordering two Asada, two Al Pastor, and a Mexican corn on a cob.  As I was placing my order, one of the cooks were making corn tortillas from scratch.   I was very please to see this, because when bite into my first bite I could tell a total difference between Taco Taco and other places like like them.    My toritilla wasn't soaked in oil, like another place famous for this, and I was very pleased with the taste of  the meat.   I would put them on par with El Gordo, but they put way more meat than them, and had the killer salsa bar.

I got the Carne Asada Fries and Al Pastor tacos. The tacos were pretty decent and I'd say would be on par with Tacos El Gordo, if it was a little spicier. That was a little disappointment to me. The carne asada fries were completely disappointing. The meat was pre-cooked and put in storage containers on the side for the Fries station. So the meat wasn't even hot at all. It was luke warm, maybe. Maybe the fries were not enough to make it luke warm. I'm not to sure. The overall taste of it was very disappointing!!   I was too hungry to remember to take pictures =[ oops. I'll definitely come back to try the other tacos, but definitely skipping the fries.   Oh, it was pretty dirty. Which is really a big no no for me, hopefully they clean up. The fans looked like there were years of dust on it....yes I said years. Maybe it was a few months, but it looked pretty bad and gross to me.   I did like the condiment bar, lots to choose from which was nice!   The soda.....skip it, most of it was flat or tasted weird =\ ugh I hate flat soda! But the horchata was really good!   So yup, overall it was mediocre. I'll come back again in a few weeks and see how it fairs.

Came here last night around 7pm to grab some shrimp tacos (3 to be exact) and 1 shrimp burrito. The guy who took my order didn't speak a word of English, which is to be expected but not understanding the sentence  3 shrimp tacos on corn tortilla  isn't acceptable.  So he starts the shrimp on the grill grabs one tortilla and says  what it . I remind him it's 3 tacos. He looks confused and had to ask someone what I was saying. He says ok gets three tortillas. He had to remake the first one 3 times because he kept putting the wrong thing on them. The shrimp is done and he puts exactly two shrimp pieces on each taco. When I've been here in the past there was always at least 6-7 pieces. When I try to ask him about this he shrugged. I decided to try and talk to someone else. He then proceeds to mess up the buritto as well by putting guac on it which I said no to. I get to the cashier and it got worse... I walk up and attempt to explain my situation to her, I even show her the amount of shrimp on my tacos. She laughs, snatches my debit card out of my hand and charges me right away. It was $20. She charged me for the tacos he messed up and the guac on the buritto. Now the money is not the issue here, it's the fact she laughed and literally took my debit card from me without my permission.

You tell them what you want on your burrito and they make it in front of you. My absolute favorite aspect of this place is that they offer vegetarian (soy based) chorizo. The food is bomb with huge portions and is relatively inexpensive.  The bad:  At the time we went, AFTER they made our food and we went to the cashier station, they said they don't accept credit/debit cards -_- We actually had to leave our food to get cold and go find a bank so that I could take out cash. It was a huge inconvenience and it really pissed me off that they couldn't warn the customers with a sign on the door or something. Or at least have the customers pay before they make the damn food. I will say, the cashier was very nice and apologetic about it, and I appreciated that.   The Ugly: The way the restaurant is set up, aesthetically makes no sense at all. It's a really weird, slightly uncomfortable environment. The 'decor', if you want to call it that, is an atrocity and again, makes no sense. They seem to be pretty busy and are doing well for themselves, why not spend a little money updating the look of the place to make it palatable. I understand it's supposed to be authentic Mexican, which usually doesn't look too nice inside. But this is Las Vegas, we get tons of tourists from all over the world, and a place that looks like that would not keep tourist coming back to this establishment.  Just my brutally honest opinion.

But I'm going to make an exception for Taco Taco, because this place is LEGIT.  The standard by which I judge all other tacos in Las Vegas is Tacos El Gordo, and specifically the adobada that they roast all day long on a spit.  Well, taco fans, I can tell you that the pastor here ranks right up there. It's a little bit less spicy and a little more cumin flavor than the pork at El Gordo. I can't say it's better than the best but it's right up there. And like El Gordo, they make their own tortillas fresh right behind the counter.  The pollo taco (an option absent from the TEG menu, incidentally) was flavorful as well, and the asada was savory and tender but the real standout was the soyrizo taco.  You heard me. Soyrizo.  Vegetarian options at Mexican restaurants typically make me feel like I'm missing something. But not with this. The flavorful, spicy fauxsage comes out topped with black beans - the perfect complement.  Best of all? You can pimp out your meal with your choice of eight salsas and two kinds of beans, plus jalapenos and cebollitas.  On the whole I'd describe Taco Taco as a hybrid of the authenticity of TEG and the attention to ingredients and health consciousness that you find at places like Zabas or Chipotle.

Not really Outer space. Just Pecos and Tropicana. The tacos are killer though.  I'm intrigued by Taco Taco because:  MUSIC: It's really loud and goes from Red Hot Chili Peppers to some hardcore Mexicana shit that brought back memories of a booze cruise in Cabo wih ten professional surfers, jungle juice bong and wrestling masks. GOOD TIMES.(Donkey were not present on the booze cruise.)  CASHIER: She is a darker version of Shakira, dresses really stylish and either wears a jewel or has a flippin piercing in her forehead. Whatever the case I think she looks like a gypsy and it's awesome!  SALSA BAR: Yes, this salsa bar wins and then wins again when the other salsa bars are checking their smart phones for tips on how to win. The salsa bar has over eight different salsas, carrot/onion mix, peppers, limes and other shit I know is there, but didn't reach for. It's always clean and well stocked.  FOOD: It's all about the tacos. I've only done the carne asada and it's pretty bomb. They don't destroy it by slopping on a fist full of guac. either like another taco shop on E. Charleston across from the old Macayo Vegas. Tacos are $2 a pop and full of meat. It's a deal. The burrito? Not so much. I swear it was $6 for the carne asada burrito and it had more rice and beans nonsense than meat. Stick with the tacos, add chips for $1.25 and head on over to the buffet of salsa.   Overall Taco Taco is a solid taco option for people near this area.

I've been on Burrito/Taco Quest for the dankest Grindz in Vegas for a long, long time. I've read review after review and had this place bookmarked for quite some time.   I found myself on the East side recently and stopped into this taqueria. Once I walked in I was shocked at how large and clean this place is. Usually taco shops in Vegas are dimly lot and kind of dirty.   There are several different stations, all with different kinds of meats. TyT offered burritos, tacos, nachos, bowls, fries, and Mexican corn. The menu is much more limited than most taco shops around town, but I don't mind. Why do 50 things okay when you can do everything on the menu superbly?   The Mexican street corn is a must! Fresh corn on the cob, lightly brushed with mayo, coated with cheese, and some spices. (It is not hot, just seasoning perfection!)  Next I ordered an al pastor taco and a lengua taco. Both were melt in your mouth goodness. The meat was perfectly seasoned and succulent. Tender and juicy. Topped with opinions and cilantro.   Another stand out is the salsa bar. There are 8 salsas. All of which are tasty and fresh. Usually when I am at a Roberto's or the like, the salsa is just gross. Either red and fiery or green and watery and flavorless. There is a green creamy salsa here that is off the charts. No only are there the premium salsas, there are black beans and pinto beans, cucumbers, limes, the spicy carrots and onions, and grilled jalapeños and onions.  My sister and I dined here for under $12 combined. This place is cheap! Too cheap in my opinion, but I can't complain.  Taco y Taco houses the best tacos I've had in Vegas to date.

As it were, once I finally went, I went 3 times in less than a week....  The first time, I had 2 gran tacos and a side of street corn.  The gran tacos are BIG, $3.50 each and fully loaded with cheese, meat, fresh pico, and avocado.  They are fantastic.  You pay $1.00 upcharge for seafood, which I did because I tried the shrimp.  They are loaded, in fact a couple of shrimp fell out and I still had shrimp in every bite.  The shrimp and carne asada are heavily seasoned, but not overly so.  The wife had shrimp and chicken, and I tried a bit of the chicken.  This may be the best flavored chicken I've ever had at a taco joint.  It had spice, but didn't turn my wife off, as she doesn't like heat as much as I do.  The street corn was fantastic, but messy.  So, I would recommend eating this while sitting down or next to a roll of paper towels.    The salsa bar is maybe the best I've seen at a taco place.  8 different sauces, pickled veggies, and a pepper onion mix that they could sell for $3.00 and it would be a bargain.  You can really dress them how you like.    I then tried a chorizo breakfast burrito (the next morning).  Probably the best breakfast burrito I've had in Las Vegas, which puts it in the running for best breakfast burrito I've ever had.  Only $3.99 and huge.  Packed with eggs, cheese, potatoes, meat and flavor.  The entire burrito was wrapped in foil which kept it piping hot.  I tried the bacon one on the next trip, but didn't like it as much.  Don't get me wrong, it was excellent, but the chorizo is where it's at breakfast wise.  I was also very impressed with the cleanliness of the restaurant and the kitchen.  The kitchen appeared to be very organized, and the employees are friendly and helpful.

Since they are aptly named Taco Y Taco, this time around I made sure to try their tacos.  So this second time around, me and the wifey decided to try different stuff aside from tacos.  We ordered  2 tacos. 1 Al Pastor and 1 Carnitas. We also got  a Carne Asada Quesadilla and a couple of Elotes.  The Al Pastor Taco was ok. Flavorwise, I have had better. The plus was that they had a little more meat than others. The Carnitas Taco was even better than the pastor. The meat was tender and had good flavor to it. Both tacos were ok. I wasn't really blown away by it. What stood out for me about them was the price. It was 3.50 for just 1 taco while most places sell it for only 2 bucks a pop. I guess that's why they're called Taco Y Taco because it's almost twice as much as other places? :P  The Carne Asada Quesadilla was really good! Besides the good meat and cheese, they put a little bit of guacamole and pico de gallo in there. I asked for sour cream on the side for no extra charge. Now this was worthy of the 5 dollar pricetag they had for it.   Last but not least, the 2 Elotes we got were pretty good. For 2.25 each, you can get it normal or  Street Style  meaning they throw butter and spices on it. If you have ever seen Nacho Libre, those very same Elotes you see in that movie are what you can get here.  Service is decent. You order what you want, grab a tray, and slide on down the counter where they put the finished product on your tray. Since they have employees at different stations, you get your food faster because they can concentrate on those things they are assigned to make.  The place itself is very spacious and can accommodate large groups at a time. Good job on keeping a place this size pretty clean.  Before I go, let me mention the salsa bar they have set up. You have a total of 8 different sauces ranging from pico de gallo, to salsa verde, to extra spicy habanero! Besides that, they have the basic pickled veggies and sauteed peppers/onions that you would find in a fajita. So to me this is another plus because of all the unlimited variety of topping choices you can add to your meal.  So in closing, I would  come back here from time to time, especially for the Elotes because not every Mexican place has them. I just wished they didn't charge so much for 1 little taco.

I asked for the pastor tacos and somewhat skimpy on the meat, the sauce was salty and the meat not very pleasant to the nose.

I recommend a roach coach before these guys, there's a lot of them on Charleston or Nellis. Go there and you'll be better off.

We placed the order a few weeks in advance, paid for it, and received a confirmation email from them. The food was to be delivered at 5:00 (which is also the time the party started, since I didn't want to serve my guests cold food). At 5:00 my husband calls just to make sure they were on their way or close to it. When he calls, they tell him that they forgot the order all together and that it would be a little late. There was no apology or effort to make up for the fact that we had a house full of guests waiting for food which they forgot to make. We had no choice but to wait for them as the food had already been paid for and it was too late for alternative arrangements. They managed to get the food to us around 5:45, and it all tasted just fine. In their rush to get the order filled, they didn't bring the right amount of tortillas and they left out a salsa. The day after the party I called to speak with someone about what had happened. I felt like more of an effort should have been made to apologize and make up for their mistake. They offered us 1 free meal. This requires us to visit their establishment and to pay for a second meal. In my opinion this did not make up for the fact that they completely forgot about our order. We asked to speak to the manager and they refused. We asked to speak to the owner, and the woman I spoke to said the owner wouldn't be in for a few days and that he would say the same thing anyway. I continued to call over the next few days to try to get a hold of a manager or owner. They continued to give me the run around. They were rude and unprofessional. I have waited a few weeks to write this review to give them an opportunity to make it right, but I'm tired of calling them. It's unfortunate that they don't care about customer service.

On our trips to Vegas my fiancé loves visiting tacos el Gordo, but they aren't veggie friendly so I decided to do some Yelp research on taco shops in the Vegas area and came accross this one. As soon as I seen that they offered vegetarian options and the regular meat tacos both looked bomb I knew I had to try it. Yea the ordering process is a little confusing but we got lucky because nobody else was in line so we just walked right up and the cooks were super helpful, and really funny- cracking jokes with us while we were ordering. My fiancé ordered the lengua, pastor, asada and loved them all. He said they were comparable or even better than that other place I mentioned. I ordered 3 of the soyrizo tacos and they were AMAZING. They don't skimp on the  meat  and they were topped with Guac, it really doesn't get any better than that for a vegetarian. They filled me up for sure. Their salsa bar is also ON POINT, I got the creamy green looking one and poured it all over my tacos and they tasted even better. As far as cleanliness of the place, it looked fine to me. I was enjoying my tacos so much everything else didn't even matter to me. As far as the lady at the register, she was fine, I didn't get any bad vibes from her. This is definitely my go-to for tacos whenever I come back to Vegas. Not too far from the strip and just all around worth it. The veggie lover and the meat eater were both 100% satisfied. Now if only they can open a location in SoCal, that would be awesome. Thank you Taco Y Taco for having an option for everyone when most other taco shops could care less.

Thanks Chris V for helping spreading the news via social media.    The restaurant was poppin!  How poppin was it?  We accidentally came in from the dining room area, saw the balloons at each table and the mariachi band performing before noticing this was the back end of the restaurant.  So we walked towards the line of people patiently waiting their turn to just order trying to find the end, and literally had to walk out the front door to wait behind a few customers that were out there at the official end of the line. That poppin!  By the time we got to the lines to order the tacos, it was almost 50 minutes later.  But the tacos were great, they didn't skimp or make it smaller, just So crazy packed and wildly successful!  I have to say that due to the massive crowd of customers that came out for $1 beer and tacos, if you were not already a pro at ordering different tacos at different stations, the ordering system can and was definitely confusing and frustrating for me.  A slip of paper to mark down what you want to order, so you can get exactly what you want without having to go wait in the back of the long line again to complete your order would have been helpful, especially on days of their super promotions.  But the tacos were tasty. Fair amount of protein on each one. I initially wanted 12 tacos, but only ended up order 7 and a Horchata, and I was full.  And the staff worked their butt off trying to make the fresh tortillas, cooking and grilling the meat fresh, and expertly assembling each tacos to order. Everyone in line can see how hard they worked and not a single person complained about the wait.   The Al Pastor (Spicy Pork) is noticeably spicier than the other places, but so good. Maybe I was closer to feeling famished after an hour of waiting in line, or their grilled chicken tacos was just that good, but 3 of them quickly disappeared after I squeezed some fresh lime juice on it.

Why must I live on the West side???  This place is further from my place than even Tacos el Gordo, but it's more spacious and less crowded - though that doesn't mean the food sucks. No my dear children - the meat is wonderful. You know how some Mexican taco joints--actually, ALMOST ALL OF THEM-- use cilantro and onion (salsa sometimes too) to mask the flavor of an otherwise unremarkably cooked meat by piling that stuff on? And that when they do that, you're basically eating a cilantro and onion taco with meat filler? Not here. I mean, yes, they have those toppings but for once, you can actually taste tender rich meat.   I'm always looking for a place that has great lengua. I'm not sure how lots of places seem to fuck it up, but they do - barely cooked, tough, absolutely lacking flavor, barely any meatiness, or all of the above. Tacos el Gordo has amazing lengua, and so does this place. Their suadero and al pastor is also top notch. And don't worry vegetarians, they got you covered - finally a place that serves soyrizo!! My boyfriend is a (cheating) vegan and loves their soyrizo.   Their salsa bar is a welcome sight for so many of us who are rather tired of choosing between just roja vs verde. It's a salsa lover's dream. Their limes are also good quality - again, sometimes taco places just throw out crappy limes out there to sit on ice all day, or barely even any at all. Haven't tried their jamaica drink yet but their horchata is well-spiced and not watered down.  I'd also urge any future visitors to this place to READ THE SIGNS ON THE TRASH BINS. There's two that specifically state they're not for garbage but for glass bottles, and I've seen people dump their trash in there anyway.

Located in one of streets various retail centers, an elevated space with backdoor and dining room accessed by the parking lot while the counter at which one orders is best approached by foot from the street, Taco Y Taco is not the sort of place to splurge on décor or creature comforts, the focus squarely on the food and matter-of-fact customer service, an argument taking place on arrival as customer argued with the cook about why he could not add eggs to an item.

Playing traditional music loudly overhead, soccer on the TV with the view out the windows facing a Plasma Donation Center, a look at the food shows a lot of time spent in preparing various meats from which the Pibil was tender, though slightly underflavored while the Carne Asada featured a robust bit of char to the tender beef with a slightly spicy linger.  Serving Beef Tripe from a small steamer basket, but happy to toss it back on the griddle when requested crispy, the Taco Tripa was undeniably unctuous with a good mix of crunch and creaminess playing well off the toppings while the crispy Tortilla griddled around melted Cheese and Pork Al Pastor was every bit deserving of the praise heaped upon it - the marinated meat almost sweet in beneath the exterior layer of caramelization and good enough that a second trip to the counter was justified for one more.  THREEE AND A HALF STARS:  Certainly no expert on Tacos or Street Food, but knowledgeable enough to know well made food and a deal, Taco Y Taco is a worthwhile stop for their signatures, though the under-seasoned Pibil and lack of a menu item at 11:00 show room for improvement.", "Date": "2016-07-25", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Lyn", "ReviewID": "3Ui5USVvy9lujES48CHuOQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "This might be the best mexican resturant in las vegas.

We made the drive across town and arrived around 9 pm. I could see as I was opening up to the door that nobody else was in line so I was a little nervous but with all of the hoopla and the drive over we wanted to give Taco Taco a shot.   The signs above easily direct you to the line you want to order from. I knew I had to try the  Al Pastor Tacos  so I ordered 2 of those. I asked for pineapple but the worker said they didn't have any. I have seen other pictures with pineapple so they must have just been out for the day. I then made my way over to where hubby was at and I ordered a  Cheese Quesadilla  and a  Asada Taco . Hubby had already ordered a  Asada Burrito . You can choose corn or flour tortillas and they do make them right in front of you. By the time we finished ordering the place had filled up so we beat the rush! We grabbed our food and headed towards the back and found a pretty nicely sized dining area. There was a salsa bar with a variety of stuff. I didn't get anything from the salsa bar so I can't comment on if it was good or not. I can however comment on the following:  Cheese Quesadilla - This was priced at $2.25 and very good! It was filled with the perfect amount of cheese and wasn't really greasy. I would order this again.  Al Pastor - Priced at $2.00 each these didn't blow my socks off. It was missing the pineapple I love so much and just lacked the flavor I have had at other places. This is usually my favorite thing to order but not so much here. I will probably give it another try on a different day to see if something is different but if not I wouldn't order it again.  Asada Tacos - These were amazing. Such good flavor! I wish I had gotten more of these than the al pastor but I will know for next time.   Asada Burrito - I didn't like this. Hubby gave me some to try and it just didn't have the same flavor as the asada in the tacos. They did pull the asada meat for the burrito from a different place then the asada that was on the grill for the tacos so I don't know if they make them different but I will personally stick to the asada tacos instead of the burrito.  They offer rice bowls and have vegetarian options.

A friend went there and said it was OK, but other places were better, so it wasn't on the priority list. Our favorite taco shop was closed last night, so we figured Taco y Taco was worth giving a try.  They were fairly busy when we walked in, as the fancily dressed manager lady was helping to maintain the dining area's appearance.   We were greeted with smiles as we ordered our food. When I saw how they heated up the burrito tortillas, I knew I was going to have issues. I am not, and never have been, a fan of warming up tortillas in steam. This makes them sticky and gooey.   Anyway, I made my burrito, and the wife had her burrito bowl made up before us. Looking at the menu, she wanted chips and guac. Side of chips: 1.05 Side of Guac: 1.25 Chips & Guac: 2.95  WTF? So, she ordered a side of guac and I ordered a side of chips. Making our way down the line of taco options, we opted to just give one dish a try for the evening. When we were giving details of our order to the cashier, the wife said what her bowl was, and a side of guac. I gave info on my burrito plus a side of chips. The cashier gave us a smirk and said she was going to ring them up separate, since it is cheaper that way. We replied by informing her that's why we ordered it as we did.  The soda machine, for the one flavor the wife wanted, was broke, they were kind enough to just give her a bottled soda.  Sitting down to eat, the burrito was the length of a plastic fork (see photos) and had less circumference than a can of soda.   Picking up my chicken burrito, it was already cold (partially due to the pile of sour cream I had included, I am sure). Oh well, I wasn't shied away by that fact. The stickiness of the tortilla was tough to get over. I prefer a crispy burrito to a soggy, sticky one.  Flavor-wise, it was good. Nothing to write home about, but it was good.   Their chips were great. I don't know what they do different to them, but they were very tasty, nice crunch and fresh.

The salsa bar was stocked with radishes, limes, cucumbers, steaming hot beans, and 8 salsas.  I started off by grabbing the 3 green salsas.  I love green anything (except celery) so this was great, a trifecta!  I had the shrimp first - stuffed with grilled shrimp, avocado, lettuce - sooo tasty.  Then, the lengua - it had tomatillo salsa on it along with cilantro and diced onion.  I added a squeeze of lime and some of the fresh bright green salsa too.  Perfection.  Juicy, tender, zingy...thank goodness I had 2!  Then we decided we needed to do a salsa tasting - I got an order of chips and guac on the cheap and then got all 8 salsas lined up.  My fave was definitely the bright deep green one.  The habanero salsa had a warning but was not very spicy to me.  I really liked my meal and would definitely come back.", "Date": "2013-05-24", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Hugo", "ReviewID": "-3rfafIfuCGNntPVCxRwFw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Good food, the meat was flavorful and the tacos were delicious!

The meat and other items are super fresh, under-seasoned and appear to be health conscious like Stephanie A. said. The service is fast and friendly (even more if you speak spanish) and the salsa bar is huge. Here is the main issue, they lack seasoning all around. I first thought this was an issue, but then I realized...Its about the SALSAS! They are amazing and provide a myriad of flavor that the tender fresh meat supports.

The set up when you walk into this place is a little confusing but holy shit is it worth it!!!! For 2$ and some change you get the most packed with meat taco on a fresh made corn tortilla. The lady was literally pressing out and cooking fresh off the grill tortillas for all the people in line. Makes a huge difference in the taste compared to pre made shitty corn tortillas. I got the regular taco which is just your choice of meat, salsa, onions, and cilantro. Simple yet delicious!! Personally I like them more simple (street taco style) If you want the beans and guac and sour cream and all the other shit ,you should probably just get a burrito. If you are one to like a little more flavor they also offer a salsa bar with a large variety of salsas to add. Another perk of this place is the street corn or elotes. Not a lot of taco spots in town offer it. It's not the best I've had here but it's pretty good. The best I've had was out of the back of a van in a parking Lott. Sketchy and delicious. So in conclusion If you are in the mood for some tacos that taste like they came out of a taco shack in Mexico this is your place. If your looking for some fancy Tex mex or Americanized taco fusion or whatever else is out there you probably won't be happy with the simple deliciousness of this place. Either way try it.

I think my comparison for Taco Taco is definitely Gordo's!   Upon seeing the lay out it does scream copycat, but looks are deceiving because I think their offerings are better than Gordo's the only point ill give to Gordo's is their adobada. Taco Taco wins in everything else.  I love Gordo's, but its always so busy! I know dumb reason to knock them, but I am happy to have discovered Taco Taco from friends.  I'd also say it's like a chipotle mixed with a Gordo's. There's a large seating area. It's always clean. The salsa bar is legit! It really is an awesome thing to have for your customers especially when you're not dining in. A label for each sauce would be good.  My first visit was during a lunch break.  I was the only person ordering and it took awhile for my food to get to me. Considering the large staff I just didn't see how it was possible.   I can't knock them for my making my food fresh, but Gordo's is quick.  Whenever I try a new place I always go crazy ordering new things so I can get a real taste for their food.   This is my final conclusion on their food.  I had their al pastor gran tacos which were yummy. I think the flavor is too salty, but still good. They are like a  supreme  taco of sorts. It's larger than their regular tacos and are packed with meat. I've also had their carne asada tacos which are good. Their fries come in full and half sizes and they also carry nachos in both sizes. You can get any meat on either. I had a bowl today that was also really good. You get a lot of choices on what you can have on the tacos.   One disappointment was when I had a language taco their was no sauce on it. Since the salsa bar has so many salsas this shouldn't be a problem, but maybe a suggestion for which sauce pairs best with each meat?   Overall it's a hit for me.  My only gripe with the place is that I don't like their ordering system. The staff is nice in that they don't send you to a different area they'll just tell the order to the  correct  person. If they found a good ordering system and a way to translate it to their customers it would make it easier for them to take orders, easier for them to serve customers, and they'd make more money in return.

It was so busy...busier than I'd ever seen the place, but everyone remained super friendly, and helpful.    Last night, I had 3 vegetarian tacos: the Seta (mushrooms), Soyrizo, and Fajita tacos.   They were all delicious, but the soyrizo was my favorite. Mildly spicy, and a lot of  meat.    The girl who made my tacos was very nice, and made sure that I didn't have any avocado near my plate.

I like to get either a rice bowl or a burrito. The meats we choose are Carnitas, Al Pastor, Lengua. They also have a delicious vegetarian mushroom type option I get if I am not feeling up to anything at all greasy.  I love the steamed corn.  They have a Mexican version I haven't tried with mayonnaise and cheese, but  I just don't want to know if I like anything that adds the calories up even more.  Good and Bad:    The tortilla is good quality, large, and the burrito is plentiful. I have to ask for it the way I like.  Cheese melted on it first then the other ingredients.  if you don't ask it may come a different way each time.  Issues:  I have gotten Lengua 3 times.  Once was lean and perfect.  Two other times it seemed almost like the skin was left on or it was way overcooked with chewy tough edges and was inedible.  I had to pull the meat out.  So, I just don't order this anymore.  Not worth the chance of receiving the bad version.  I guess you could ask to taste it before they add it.  The carnitas is different depending on who works too.  Sometimes it is GREAT meaty bits with a delicious flavor and other times it includes large globs of FAT with NO MEAT attached.  I mean come on.  Totally gross and puts you off the food.  Now I try to ask for lean.  Didn't seem to make a difference last time.  Had to pull the fat out of a burrito.  So now I have been ordering it as a rice bowl more often to make it easier.  Very very sad that I have to even think about this.  The Al pastor has been good each time.  It is best when they cut it up into smaller pieces.    All the other items are good quality.  I never see any old looking items or even avocado that has turned colors even.  Nice job.  Let's work on the meat consistency and trim the fat off please.

I mean, I took 5 years of Spanish living in San Diego, so I can kinda get by, but this is a place where all the workers speak Espanol to each other and I couldn't keep up!  And when I ordered in English, I felt very much like a Gringo!  Damn, I wish I had practiced that Spanish more after high school!  Anyway, let's get to the food.  They have burritos, quesadillas, tacos, and bowls, but I went for the little street tacos!  I got one asada, one carnitas, and one al pastor.  Asada: Meat was very flavorful and juicy.  Sometimes when you get asada at other places, it can by dry and tough.  This stuff was delicioso.  Carnitas: They were ok, not my favorite of the three.  Al Pastor: WINNER WINNER WINNER!!!!!  This meat was INSANE.  Such good flavor, and the sauce they put on top of it was great!  Only thing I didn't like was the chunk of pineapple they put on top (I really hate pineapple), but it was ok cuz I just gave it to my husband.  Tortillas: I have a big problem with corn tortillas because they always split in the middle when you try to pick up the taco and all your innards get everywhere, but NOT HERE.  These tortillas held it together and were nicely toasted.  Salsa Bar: 1 salsa? 2 salsas?  No. SIX salsas!!!  And there was a smoky spicy one that's the kind that's so spicy, but you can't stop eating it because if you stop your lips will burn so you just have to keep eating it!!  A good burn.  Also, there were carrots and even beans at the salsa bar.  Ambiance: The restaurant is very large, very clean, and they even had live entertainment singing.

I had a carne asada burrito and decided to try the al pastor tacos. It is the best al pastor I've had so far here in Vegas. I love Pepe's Tacos and Los Tacos Companita which have excellent al pastor. Taco Y Taco's al pastor blows them out of the water! The salsa bar is clean and a great variety of salsas. The tables were clean and the staff is constantly cleaning up after messy people that leave there trays on the table. Unlike Roberto's or Pepe's where its usually messy and the tables are filthy and the salsa bars are usually disgusting! I was very impressed how well they keep the dinning area. Taco Y Taco has fresh ingredigents and ordering at the windows is easy. Everything is made in front of you and the protions are good sized.    The Bad: I would give it 5 stars but for a total experience they lose 2 stars for the fact that they have a huge swap cooler in the dining area. Its loud and if you're not sitting where the air is blowing on you it's very hot inside. I hate sweating while I'm trying to eat. Next time I'll get it to go and eat in the car with the AC on.  Homeless and shady people hanging around the doors begging for money and cigarettes. I really hate this. The manager needs to run these shady folks away, call Metro or whatever get rid of them.

I also got for my friend an asada taco, an asada vampiro and some Mexican corn.   This place is a little hard to find, I literally drove by it twice and finally had to get directions from Siri. I walk in and the place is pretty clean, am greeted by a few employees working the stations and make my way to the nacho one. Being my first time here I was a little confused but the guy behind the counter explained he would take care of a few of the items and to go to the other window for the asada stuff. This place is very well organized which I can appreciate. So after he's done making my food he goes to the other person I ordered from gets the rest of my order an walks it up front. Talk about good service. Everyone was smiling and I was in and outta there in less then 5 minutes.   So the food: I may or may not have accidentally (okay no accident at all) ate my friends asada taco on the way home. I mean, they did still have the vampiro and I immediately wante to go back and get like, 5 more (though i figured id save that for another trip).They were amazing just the right amount of flavor.  The nachos didnt impress me look wise, they kinda seemed pretty bland but as soon as I bit into them I quickly changed my mind. They were awesome. Not the best chicken I've ever had but not the worst and the guacamole could use some more flavor but overall you get more then your money's worth.  The corn is standard Mexican corn. It was okay though I don't recommend getting it to go...it loses most of its flavor in the foil they wrap it in and u just end up with mayo corn.  The vampiro...if u haven't tried it, do. I had a bite of my friends and also amazing. Meat was cooked just right, had a great flavor and only around $3.   So would I recommend this place? Definitely. Under $15 for all that stuff means the price is right and the food is more then worth it. Some other places have worse nachos for the same price as this whole meal for 2.

You can customize most of the food on the menu. Begin by choosing an item that you want to order and then choose your meat and fillings. Some of the meat options include  are alpastor, carne asada, lengua, and cabeza. If you don't eat meat, no worries. There's a soyrizo option. I have yet to try this, but I've heard positive things from friends who did.   On this visit, I got the bowl and chose alpastor as my meaty filling along with pinto beans, lettuce, shredded cheese, and pico de gallo. Guacamole is $1 more, but I'd suggest getting a side of chips an guac for a few bucks because you will receive a generous amount of guacamole that might be enough for both chips and your entree. Back to my order, I thought the meat was good and surprisingly not salty. I say that because most Mexican restaurants I've been to in Vegas add too much salt to their food -- or not enough. Kick your food up a notch by hitting up the salsa bar. The extra hot habanero sauce is a good choice; made me perspire a bit.  Not only is the food good, but the service is decent.

Many kept on comparing to another taco place that is very popular  in Vegas.  Yes , yes ,   Tacos el Fatty  !  Where to start ? I walked in and never as busy as the comparison  and the staff was to busy talking to each other instead of helping the few customers they did have.  I almost left, but another customer walked over and asked if it was my first time. (Probably my confused look) I Said yes and he explained how it all works.  Your typical taco place where you go order what you want from where you want it.   Tortillas smelled good and they taste home made.  The tacos were good, but nothing out of this world.  I would not compare as they hold their own, but  will admit the way they are prepared is very untraditional !  I've seen the local and the traditional  taquero who prepare a taco with passion and ensures it's delicious. These were more of Taco Bell style where they know they need to add this and that because somebody told them that is what it should have .  Making a good tacos is an art... Believe it or not!   The tacos de Asada were good and will admit better than tacos el fatty.  However then we come to al pastor !! I stand that Tacos El gordo has the best al pastor. The meat , the seasoning , and that green sauce makes the taco Amazing and Taco y Taco was good as the pineapple in top adds flavor  but the meat was a little cold and lacked flavor compared to others.   In closing if you are hungry and want tacos Al pastor and can't wait or don't feel like driving then yes this is your place.  However if you want a great tacos al pastor this would not be the place .  Also the place was not as clean as it could have been.  In my opinion  with the amount of employees present floors should have been spotless , fountain drink area should have been clean and salsa bar should have been up kept.  Oh not all was that bad ..

After a disappointing taco experience a week ago, I wanted to erase that memory with someplace better.  Taco y Taco definitely fit the bill.  Making last minute plans with the b/f and BFF, the three of us met up for dinner around 7:00pm on a Thursday night.   MENU SUMMARY:  Tacos, burritos, quesadillas, bowls, elote (corn on the cob), fries, nachos, mulas, and vampiros.  I don't know what a mula is, but we found out that a vampiro is made up of two crispy tortillas with cheese and your choice of meat in the middle.  The meats: al pastor, asada, pollo, tripas, carnitas, cesos, cabeza, lengua, trompa, suadero, buche, and chorizo.  Vegetarians have an option of soy chorizo and panela (pasteurized cheese).     We were offered a sample of their al pastor when we first approached the counter; this is what it's supposed to taste like!  Whatever I had last week did not compare to this flavorful meat.  I ultimately opted for two asada tacos and the elote, Mexican street style.  Those choices cost less than $7.  There is a salsa bar available so you can jazz things up if you want, as well.  I had my tacos made simply, with onions, cilantro, and salsa and they were both delicious.  The mere fact that they offer elote alone will keep me coming back:  I love that stuff.  For $2, I got a very large ear of corn on a stick with everything, which means mayo (yes, mayo), cheese, and chili powder:  fabuloso!    The place is spacious and clean and the staff is very personable.  We stayed for over 2.5 hours, enjoying their food and our conversation.

If you don't have a taco list, start one immediately, and put Taco Taco on it twice. What I love most about this double the name, double the delicious eatery, is that based on my limited knowledge, it appears to be authentic but is easy enough for a gal like I myself to navigate without feeling completely clueless. Big signs help.   There are different stations for different meats. Just saunter up and let the cook know how many you'd like of your preferred meat. They'll whip them up fresh, plate them hot and push them over the counter to you. They have a large selection of meats, including lengua. They even have vegetarian chorizo, aka soyrizo. The tortillas are made fresh in house, and each meat comes with a different selection of toppings and salsa. If you want to avoid carbs, they do bowls as well, and if you want a bigger bite, burritos are available. The variety is incredible.   I am a sucker for pastor with pineapple, so as soon as I saw that beauty spinning with a hunk of pineapple on top, I said,  Give me two!  Unfortunately, I thought it was too salty, and thereby violated a sacred taco shop rule: On the first visit, just order one of each so you can decide which one you really like. Here, it was the carnitas that I should have doubled up on! I should have known when I saw the simmering pot of juicy pork bits.   Every taco is super generous with the meat. It's definitely a $2.00 pile of goodness. The service is super friendly. The place is big and clean.

Most of the food we ordered was very light on meat. The pastor burrito was small compared to other restaurants and had a cloves after taste, carnitas also tasteless, very unusual as was the rest of the food. The pics on here are deceiving.  The flavors were mild to tasteless, not a typical taco stand. I think this place caters to the UNLV crowd, enough said. Not a good value for the money.

I think I was hoping to find a hole in the wall gem, but I didn't.   I had three tacos and some chips and salsa. overall total was around 10 bucks. All the salsa was fresh and had I had many choices. The taco's were just okay. I have had better and I have had worst.

The set up of the restaurant is a little confusing.  The doors facing the shopping center is actually the back door where you'll find the tables and salsa bar.  Instead, enter from the entrance nearest Pecos and it will bring you to the ordering stations.    There are two ordering stations.  The one you see when you first enter is where you can order bowls, burritos, nachos, fries, and elotes.  The station with numbers on the side is where you order your tacos   I love how friendly the staff here are.  They've always started a conversation with me while I'm ordering and helpd me change up my order. Did I mention the portions here are huge!!  So far everything I've tried, I couldn't finish.    Al Pastor is my favorite choice of meat, but I find it to be too greasy and not as flavorful as my favorite taco shop.  The carne asada is really good though and I had a sample of their soyrizo and it was tasty!   *free elote with check in!  If you've never had it, OMG TRY IT NOW! ITS HEAVEN IN YOUR MOUTH.  Corn topped with mayo, cotija cheese, and chili powder.  If they dont offer it for free anymore... I'd still say you should try it.  $2 may seem like a steep price for corn, but I realized the cart lady at my park sells it for the SAME PRICE.", "Date": "2013-09-29", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Kelly", "ReviewID": "Zjy0diJrQvUCPwotg8FB7g", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I am a big critic when it comes to tacos.

I am MAD. haha.  So I knew there were 2 new taco spots in the area and I wanted to try both of them.   When I first pulled up I thought, oh cool a nice little corner shop.  After I parked and walked over to the corner shop I saw the other half of the business and thought, YES! It has a big dining area and multiple stations but when I came in on a Thursday night there was no customers except me and another customer it might be a sign. Anyways I just tried them because it looked nice enough and I was already here. As with every business I first venture to I must explore the menu before ordering, trying to remember things I can include in the review, I must've looked a little curious because one of the girl workers, I think she was a hostess, approached me and we started having a friendly conversation.  I don't remember what we talked about but it eventually ended up with me getting a plate of meat samples, SCORE, and ordering some lengua tacos, I'm sure I must have said  How's the tongue?  and  I would like some tongue  in our conversation, not  I want some beef tongue tacos.   I went with two tacos http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/taco-taco-mexican-eatery-las-vegas?select=YjOw4JLUEZ36X9O5BYS6hw#G6-xTt9g3-Q3DAQ_84_c7w  The al pastor and lengua tacos, both were delicious. The al pastor meat was layers upon layers of awesome tasting pork meat cooking in it's own juice with other spices on a spit.  Request for the meat in the middle or lower section of the spit, a lot more juicier and not as dried up as the top.  The top section is still good too it's crispy and pineapple tasting.  Once in the tortilla it was topped with onion, cilantro, pieces of pineapple, and a green sauce.  The lengua meat was tender and topped with onion, cilantro, and a green salsa.    I'm a sauce guy and I love that there's various sauces and complimentary ingredients you can add to even enhance my food. Hook it up with some of that habanero sauce please. Their condiments bar have everything from grilled, or was it fried, green onions and peppers, various sauces/salsas, limes, radish, and carrots. I might be forgetting a few other items but this condiments bar is probably one of the main reasons their 5 star in my book. This might be my favorite place because they variety on their menu.  I mean you can select from tacos, burritos, bowls, nachos, fries, etc.  There's like 12 different meats you can put.  If you're vegetarian, they have something for you.  I wonder if they sell alcohol, if they do I'M NEVER GONNA LEAVE. I'd hang out here cause they also have a TV and those various Vegas Weekly and Seven magazines, which I always pick up and look through.  The customer service here was awesome.  Very friendly and their ordering system is easy to follow.  You're not going to get overwhelmed here or seem hurried.  They have a bell hanging on the wall that I think you're suppose to ring if you liked it, GO crazy and ring the damn bell if you like it.  They're located in the North East corner of Pecos and Tropicana, where there's a Bank of America.  It shares the same building as BOA but on the North, opposite end, of the building.  There's a few nice shops between BOA and TT, just make up an excuse that you have to stop at the bank then come here before or after. Also at night the area is well light outside and it's not in a bad area.  They have a website that you can order from, nice flyers, and a nice interior so it seems like some money has been put into the business.  Oh yea it's just a bus ride out from UNLV or if your in the Tropicana or Pecos route.  And they now serve beer!!!

That should say something! Not your typical Americanized Mexican-type food. Very authentic, and their carnitas and carne asada grande tacos are fantastic! I also got the carne asada burrito bowl with no rice. The red and green sauce here is far better than many of the other Mexican restaurants I have attended.  The best thing here is that they appreciate individuals who observe lent by offering grilled fish and shrimp in taco, burrito, and bowl form(s)! Their jalapenos are the best!

I showed up around 8p with my friend Adam M. to check this place out after having a sampling of Taco Taco at the Yelp 89XXXhibition Block Party last month. I went in already knowing what I wanted to get - one taco each of asada, lengua, cabeza, and al pastor (hey now, don't judge - they are TINY tacos!). Seeing that asada requests were in one station, lengua and cabeza in the next, and al pastor in the last, I started by waiting in the first line for asada. A senora swooped in next to me, but I figured she was getting items from the other stations, so I didn't think too much of it. Then she started to talk - ohhh boy.    QUIERO TRES TACOS DE LENGUA, CUATRO DE CABEZA, TRES DE ASADA, CUATRO DE AL PASTOR - NO, SABES QUE? CUATRO DE ASADA. Y QUE DIJE, TRES DE LENGUA? NECESITO SEIS.  Okay, for those of you who are asking yourselves, WTF is going on, essentially she was ordering for the entire Chivas soccer team as well as half of the Latin Grammy Awards production staff, except for some reason I only saw 4 people at her table, herself included. But what the heck! I'M waiting for asada, why is there no respect for the station and its signage!?   So ordering is a little hectic. But once you can get beyond that, the service is super friendly, and the food is fantastic!  The al pastor is decorated with pineapple bits on top of the hefty chunks of pork, while the asada, lengua, and cabeza tacos are all very well seasoned, and when ordered  con todo,  ( with everything ) there is onion, cilantro, and salsas sprinkled on to enhance - not overpower - the meats. All of the tacos have very generous helpings of meats that, after being well salsa-ed, sit on the strongest little corn tortillas I have ever seen. Speaking of salsas, they have an awesome salsa bar as well - everything ranging from mild to habanero HOT, with chunky and smooth options too.   They offer a free corn on the cob with any type of social media check-in (e.g. Facebook, Four Square, etc.) but they were out the night I went :( But they did offer me a free taco instead. I'm not an idiot to say no to a free taco, so OK! I'd definitely recommend bringing cash - it seems like their credit card machine is touch and go, so save yourself the hassle of having to go out to the Bank of America just to get more dinero.", "Date": "2013-07-03", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Mary", "ReviewID": "RTW8Vna8xmOEK9idxlCp3A", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Where have you been all my taco life?
