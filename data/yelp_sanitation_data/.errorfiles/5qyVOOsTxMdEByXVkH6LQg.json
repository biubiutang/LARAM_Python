I have been to a lot of starbucks in a lot of different places and this location is awful!

I have been here numerous times because it is the closest location to my house and I truly wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt.  What finally made me review this location is today I was the ONLY person in the place with 7 employees working and it took 15 minutes to get a simple iced peach green tea lemonade.  I have no idea how with so many people working, the process is so inefficient.  The drive-thru line only had 4 cars in it too.

I picked up my order and my cup (grande) had 3/4 cup full of ice. I notified the barista and she just blew me off. Usually SB is so good about offering to remake it. So after two sips my drink was gone. I went back up to the counter and showed them all the ice in my cup and the print out showed light ice. The partner said well we ran out of cold brew. Hmm maybe that is why they added all that ice. So then I said well could I at least get a small cup of regular coffee and make my own iced coffee...I still needed caffeine. Then a partner brought me a cup of cold coffee, not sure if it was cold brew or if they keep a supply of cold regular coffee on hand. I was confused. So then I go to the station where they keep cream, milk, and sugar and there are NO CARAFES of anything. I wanted to doctor up my cold coffee and my full cup of ice. The whole time it was like I was putting them out. I noticed employees being bunched up chatting near the pastries, etc. I have been to this location before and I agree they are slowwwwwwww My parents live in the area and I told them my experience and the said they go out of their way NOT to go here but I had no choice I was staying at the Hampton Inn.

While standing at the pick up window I noticed a barista holding a venti cup with a few shots of espresso.  Then she scooped up some ice and put it on top of the espresso. I told her I asked for the ICE 1st and then the espresso. She told me this is how we serve it and tried to hand it to me. I asked for the manager and she ignored my request. I then had another employee find me the manager,  MAURISO .    I told Mauriso the situation, explained that I have been drinking  quad espresso's OVER ICE in venti cups since Starbucks first arrived in S. Nevada 20+ years ago.

Yes, I agree with previous reviewers that complain about the wait time. It seems pretty slow.   However, my biggest complaint is that about 50% of the time...they get my drink wrong. Here is what I order, and exactly how I say it:   I'd like a venti, iced, sugar free vanilla latte, with 2%milk, well stirred please.   (Yes I even always say please). And I always, always tip the baristas. (I have literally borrowed cash from a coworker before because while I had $$ on my app, I didn't have cash on me for a tip).  When my drink is handed to me and it seems too dark, I know they've put in nonfat milk. Yes I know I could stand to lose a few pounds, but I just don't like nonfat milk in my iced coffee.   I tell them it doesn't look right and they'll swear its 2%. Only when I practically force them to check with who made it that they find out that I'm right. Hey, I get this drink 4-5 times a week and know what it looks and tastes like.   The other thing that bothers me is that when I order it, I get lectured that I really don't have to mention that I want 2% since it's their standard milk. Really??? Then why is my drink wrong so many times?

Not one of the best Starbucks in town. Location is great as I pass it often, however, good location doesn't make up for bad service and product.   As a common practice I use the mobile ordering which has been absolutely wonderful. I'm not one who jumps and shows up 2 minutes after I place the order, as it takes time to pull and make the order, and have had positive results with the time allocation on the app.   I went into this Starbucks to see if my order was ready and no one would even greet me. I asked where the mobile order pick up was, as I became frustrated waiting because the allocated time on the app had expired, which meant my order for 2 specialty coffees should have been ready and no one said anything while I waited at the counter. Finally after asking again, the barista took my 2 drinks and handed them to me. They had been sitting there the entire time!!    I could understand if they were busy, but I was the only customer at the time waiting and they were too busy talking to each other.   Thanks for the cold coffee.....

We ordered Oatmeal, Pumpkin Spice latte, & classic coffee cake through the app coming out of a doctors appointment with a very sick child. My husband goes in the pick up our order. (Already ordered & paid for through the app, duh.) Usually he runs in to pick up an already ready order but not this time. They hand him the food & leave him waiting for the drink for about 20 mins. He sees a cup just sitting & asked if it was a PSL. They replied yes...it was sitting there the whole time. By the time he comes back to the car all the food is cold & I take a drink of the PSL but it had absolutely no pumpkin flavor to it. But with a sick & cranky kid (from sitting in the car for 20mins) in tow am not willing to go back in to get the correct drink.

Sometimes they are on top of it and you are in and out of there in minutes, and sometimes you wait and wait and wait. I wish they would put the lid stoppers out or within reach so you don't have to try to get someone's attention to get one.

Employees: Fast service and friendly. You can tell it's a happy group as they get along well with each other. Lots of smiles.  Location: Sits slightly west of the SW corner of St. Rose and Seven Hills. Easy right-turn access for eastbound St. Rose traffic; all other traffic should enter through Horizon Ridge and Seven Hills/Spencer stoplight -- takes a few turns to navigate through the parking lot. Tons of parking--you will never lack for a space as it shares a large parking lot with a Hampton Inn & Suites.  Customers: Serves Seven Hills/Anthem and Silverado Ranch communities, which means predominantly affluent  clientele. A few odd characters (as with any Starbucks) -- ran into an extremely pungent gentleman with a plastic broom and a glittery pink backpack on my first visit. Gets slightly busy in the mornings but there are always plenty of seats; nowhere near as busy as the 8975 S. Eastern or 10604 S. Eastern locations that are 1-2 miles away.  Amenities: INSIDE -- 10-11 faux-white marble-topped tables (including 1 handicap) with seating for 20-24 (mostly wood with 2 leather chairs and one long high-backed tufted jacquard fabric bench near the baristas) and 4-5 dual electrical sockets. Like all the Starbucks in Las Vegas/Henderson I've visited, the AC is set very low so it's cool-bordering-on-cold inside, even in the summer. Bathrooms are unlocked and fairly clean. OUTSIDE: 8 tables (including 1 handicap) with 16 chairs and 5 patio umbrellas in a partially fenced courtyard.  Overall: Love this location. It's fairly quiet (but not so quiet that you're the only one around, which always feels weird to me), and the store is clean and well upkept, the location is easy to get with easy parking, there's plenty of seating and wall plugs, and the staff is very friendly.", "Date": "2012-06-22", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Melodie", "ReviewID": "Y6Rp3spuMAyNoS3k-UKxKQ", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Coffee tastes great, but takes forever in the drive thru!!!!!
