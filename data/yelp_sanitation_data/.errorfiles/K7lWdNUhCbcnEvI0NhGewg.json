Anyway this one was okay.  The decor is great and the space is very open and inviting.  There is ample room to move and it's not overly crowded.

For years I have been wanting to go, but usually the people I go to Vegas with aren't interested in trying it ( they don't like buffets) and the ones that have tried it have a strong opinion against it. While my group was busy- I decided I would go myself to try it. What a disappointment.   Maybe I was just expecting too much? For whatever reason it was just unimpressive to me.   1.  They do have a fairly good selection of stuff; many are unique takes on classics. The stuff I liked- I ate plenty of.  I will have to say that the desserts are on the same caliber of home town buffet's desserts ( basic classic desserts, nothing too special). I will hive that the ice-cream/gelato is good (again, nothing too special).   2. The service is good. My waitress was amazing and super kind.   3. I liked plenty of things, and didn't care for a handful of things. The crab to me didn't seem fresh- it smelled fishy to me. The carving station  was good, all the meats were tender and cooked perfectly; i paired most of it with the BBQ sauce ( delicious). I liked the pho, but it burned my hand as I was pouring the soup onto my bowl. They have a number of different pasta dishes, all good with a need dose of salt and pepper. They have a fresh cook seafood station which was good.  The sushi was my least favorite- it was cold :(.    4. The cost for lunch is (M- F) is $27. I happened to go right at 2:30 so I started with the lunch and ended with the dinner ( lunch ends at 3 and dinner starts at 3). I didn't see too much of a difference. I will say that the buffet is worth 27, but in no way would I pay the dinner price.   5. I would come back if someone wanted to come back with me.

So many choices in different cuisines, that I ended up eating breakfast food, and then lunch food 30 minutes later.

The first try was a fail, since we arrived after the 3:30pm closing time. On second try, we arrived around 2pm, thinking perhaps we had missed the lunch rush....quiet hallways leading down to the buffet......no line to the cashier....and STOP.   The line of people waiting to be seated looked comparably long to the one at the Wynn we saw the day before. However, this line didn't move as fast, if even perceptibly at all. By the time we got seated nearly 45 min, we were starved, and thirsty!  The extra $8 for unlimited champagne was worth it, although refills didn't happen at exactly the speed I'm used to at NYC brunches. So was the $40 price tag worth it? ($30 + alcohol + tax)  Yup.  The small plate style of many of the food options made the buffet less trough-like, and although we caught the tail end of brunch, everything was still fresh and hot. I avoided the token asian dishes (lo mein, fried rice, kung pao chicken), and focused on the real food - boiled egg with avocado and bacon vinaigrette, omelet bar, sashimi, lamb chops, steamed clams.....i could go on, but basically this was the classiest buffet I'd seen.   The desserts were my favorite - there were actually lactose/gluten free options!  I had a choice of several sorbets, as well as a house-made marshmallow served in a dark chocolate cone.   Great service (we never felt rushed out), and nice spacious table set ups in addition to the non-buffet like food really made this a great dining experience.", "Date": "2012-08-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Sharon", "ReviewID": "yzZbUJZ8Cq4Kb9Jf4tSh9A", "Overall": "5", "Content": "By far one of the best buffets that I've been to yet...

The second run was just some soft goat cheese, bread sticks, and sliced salami with pistachios in it. Then I had a a small scoop of pistachio gelato for dessert. Service was good, but I was here during transition to the lunch portion of brunch and several items were not available or were picked over.

The food isn't that great and 2. If the food is good, I can't stop eating. Unfortunately for my stomach, the food here was great. This was the last stop before heading home. The wait/line for Sunday brunch was sooo long! Felt like I was in a Disneyland line for a ride. However, its safe to say that it was worth it. For about $30.00 you get to stuff your face with quality food.  There is a little something for everyone, from pasta, salads, breakfast items...too many things to name. Luckily for me, most things came in somewhat  small portions...which only meant that I had to try whatever I could get my hands on. There were so many things to choose from that it made my head spin.  Some of my favorite items were: the angry mac n cheese, short ribs, salmon, dumplings, and apple salad. I took a quick peek at the breakfast items..and almost shed a tear when I saw the jar of nutella. Finally, I had to try the dessert. There were a lot of options. With my major sweet tooth, I had to brace myself and try almost everything. They had a wide variety of mini trifles, cheesecakes, and other goodies. They even had a gelato bar! Sugar-free items were also available (macarons, tiny trifles, chocolate mousse). A second stomach is seriously needed at this buffet.  The only downfall is the service..took forever to get our drink orders and utensils.  Highly recommend checking this buffet out...just don't do it before a 4 hour drive home like I did -_-", "Date": "2012-05-03", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "tammy", "ReviewID": "cmKbT9mLXJC7_TXXJrc9ow", "Overall": "2", "Content": "This is probably one of the worse buffet ever. $45 and there were hardly anything impressive.

So another person had written a review about how this buffet has a good weekday brunch price ($27) on the same day I went to go try it (12/19/16). When I got there the price was $43! And the reason was because its Christmas week but technically Christmas is next week so that really made no sense. I've seen reviews how they're buffet is the best in town so I decided to give it a shot with my girlfriend. In total we waited an hour to pay and get seated. The food was a hit and miss, for the most part it was a miss, some of the food being too dry, not cooked right, or not that tasty. There was some good choices like the eggs Benedict, bacon, chilaquiles, and shrimp cocktail. They did have a wide variety that I didn't really get to choose from because my stomach was feeling weird after a couple plates in. At other buffets I'm able to thrown down 4-5 plates and still feel pretty good. As soon as we left my girlfriend and I had to use the restroom badly and it was not a pretty scene.

It touts itself as an upscale buffet located in the ritzy Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino. The only thing upscale about this place was the price ($38 per person). The food was OK, but not really worth the price we paid, considering this is supposed to be upscale. The mac and cheese bar was  meh , the Asian section was lacking, and the gnocchi was not cooked properly. Not what I am expecting from a $80+ bill at the Cosmo.

For variety, though, it was most assuredly  a 5.  We went on a Monday night and had a ten-minute wait. There was definitely something for everyone on this buffet. The first station catered to vegetarians: breads and cheeses, fruit bowls, salads and Mediterranean items. The latter included a heartbreaking hummus that could not even stand up to what you'd get at your local grocery store. On a positive note, this area had the most delectable kale salad I've ever had. There were a couple of shrimp offerings, too.  Next was the Mexican area, which was . . . meh?  The rest was devoted to more eclectic and ethnic dishes including hand-stuffed Italian sausage, chicken tikka, sushi, beef with peppercorn sauce, oxtail (disappointing) and even pizza and mac and cheese for the kids. A few were misses, but most met with our expectations. I only gave a few examples, but there were dozens upon dozens of choices.   Oh, and the dessert area is awesome and includes an ice cream and gelato bar, so even if you think you don't have room, sidle on over, since there's always room in the cracks for those!

Really folks... the deal is not what it used to be and they are living on lost reputation... kinda like a chicken that is running around after its head is cut off.   Yes they have some intriguing and great items here. However when I was just here, not 1 person was impressed. When I see the prices that people used to pay of $22 for brunch/breakfast, I can agree my whole outlook would likely be different. However the price is not $39+tax & tip. So realistically you are looking at a $50 meal. Is this place worth that? To be BLUNTLY BRUTALLY HONEST, OHHH HELL NO! It's a standard Vegas buffet.  The Good:  Bangers n mash - Hands down the best tasting item on the menu. The sausage snapped when taking a bite. Even on a precut portion. The gravy was perfect. However the mash was one of the best, if not the best, that I may have ever had.  Stir Fry Beef - My second favorite item on the menu. But you can get the same results from just about any good Chinese restaurant for $10-15.  Watermelon Juice - Super Tasty, but I cant remember what exactly that they called it  Kalbie Ribs - If you like strong flavors (perhaps over the top) this was an awesome thing to eat as well. There was no subtlety here it was in your face taste and I loved it.  Gelatto - Hit and miss, but the mint chip was outstanding and the best of the 5 flavors that I tried.  Cheesecake - very rich moist and extremely filling in small portions  BACON! Just the right level of crispy and soft. Very flavorful, and tasted more how I make my bacon than I almost ever find at a restaurant.  The OK: Prime Rib au jus Blue cheese Cream corn with red n green peppers Most of the deserts  The unimpressive: Angry mac n cheese - bad day? The cheese wasn't creamy and seemed to be separating, very oily Linked sausage from the carving station - no snapping, no taste, no interest Fried Chicken - no taste hardly at all. The Colonel 's chicken is ten billion times better than this. (several of the yelpers I was eating with agreed that this is the worst that they have tasted chicken from wicked spoon) Gnocchi - very very bland with an unanticipated consistency, almost grainy if that makes sense. Definitely different from when I have had this in the past The asian riblets - very weird tasting and I only took a small niblet to figure that one out  The five billion little dishes for food to come in. This is an utter nightmare. I do like that all the dishes can be tasted separately, but it's still a royal pain in the derrière!  This is easily solved by plates with dividers on them as an option... it is a buffet err cafeteria after all. Ohhh wait, does it matter? They ran out of all of these lil pint size dishes and started putting out large bowls for things previously in mini dishes.  The service sucked. I had to ask for more juice several times and they didn't want to take the dirty dishes even though we had piles of mini bowls, baskets, plates, etc... Then when they did take plates from us, they just grabbed everything from you including what you may still have been working on.  In summation, for the money spent, this place is not worth it to go to again for me. Perhaps it was a bad day. At least I didn't wait in line for this crap like so many others were doing. Drop the price, kills the stupid excess dishes, improve service, make sure you don't have an off day in the kitchen, and I bet I may like it. I would have been satisfied in the $20 range. But at a base price of double that, it simply does not even remotely contemplate being a good deal...  One last thing, being it was brunch, if you wanted champagne, mimosa's, or alcohol period, that was an additional fee. Bottomless mimosa's was an additional $10 per person!", "Date": "2013-07-08", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "RaShae", "ReviewID": "J2Ngt0AP-bR4b0psG6O7gg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Buffets are in abundance in Vegas, so picking one can be like a crap shoot.

Most dishes are presented in small plates, shot glasses, or mini replica pots.  This is perfect for sampling without gorging yourself and wasting food.  The majority of the dishes are excellent.

Some stuff were oddly flavored, overcooked, too dry, or mushy.  I was able to try the crab legs, some legs were good, some legs were bad. The crab legs were skinny compared to the ones at other buffets.  The dessert selection I thought kind of sucked. Everything I grabbed just tasted like pure sugar. I wasn't able to try the gelato though, but I'm sure that's probably the best thing to get there dessert-wise. Variety of flavors :). They do have a lot of chocolate-covered strawberries though :)  They have fresh fruits like banana and plums. I took a few so I don't feel too guilty about consuming all the food I ate.  I do love their presentation of the food items, however, I think they should really work on the taste of their food before presentation.

But I will go real soon...  So far, this one is my favorite, the dishes are placed in small containers, which is a nice touch. It's very well portioned, it's small so it allows you to try different things.  My problem with buffets is this: what to eat, and what not to eat. Some people go for what they think is the most expensive stuff and gorge themselves to make it worth it... and there are so many things to try, once you've tried most of what you wanted to try, you're already full.  And while buffets are made for quantity, I like to take my time to try different things, I know I shouldn't eat the salad, but having a balanced meal matters to me so leave me alone if I don't eat the crab legs by the boat load!!!  On the variety side, this place really shines, pretty much all major cuisines represented, from chinese japanese french italian american... whereas most buffets have the whole wall in the back with some station before the wall, most of them only have original items on half the spread, and the items are repeated on the other half of the wall. Not here, the whole buffet is unique, no food is repeated anywhere!!!  Of the few items that people keep talking about, namely angry mac an cheese and bone marrow, I found these item s to be meh. I actually liked the pork sliders, fried oysters, rib tips, parpadelle, kim chi fried rice, crab salad, mushroom salad...  The pasta was fresh and had good texture, worthy of an italian restaurant!!! Kim chi fried rice was so good, I actually had seconds, I know I know don't eat rice at a buffet!!! lol  Sadly I never finished sampling the whole spread and was actually full before I tasted all the stuff I wanted to try. On the dessert side, I really like the coconut flan, and the thai iced tea gellato. And never before seen is the chesse plate among the dessert spread, very nice touch.

We tried it on a weeknight around 6:20/6:30pm and the lines were longer than I expected. And yes, I said lines...plural! You have to wait in line to pay and then you get in another line to wait for a table. Luckily, our friend who recommended this place had one of her Vegas-local friends arrive a little earlier and get a place in the wait-to-be-seated line. That definitely eased the pain. I'm not sure if I would have been willing to wait without that arrangement, but I'm the kind of person who hates long lines...especially when I'm starving! ;)  The Wicked Spoon is located in the Cosmopolitan and has a nice atmosphere and layout. It was a little strange only because it feels like you have to walk all the way into a back corner to get to it (past conference rooms and such).  $35/person is how much it cost and it seems like too much if you ask me. We didn't have to pay...thank goodness! At first, it looked like it might be worth it because I saw people with crab legs and such. My husband and I both ended up being disappointed with the crab legs because you could hardly get anything out of the shells without a bunch of torn cartilage mixed in.  Shrimp and grits were surprisingly tastier than I expected and the mac and cheese bar was fun and yummy! Yes, there is a man who prepares it for you with whatever mix-ins you select. He serves it to you in a cute little pot and it is cheesy goodness!   The dessert section didn't disappoint with a good variety of chocolate treasures and even chocolate-dipped strawberries.   Our waitress was friendly and did well with our drink orders and kept up with taking away our dirty dishes as went along.   As I mentioned, I just don't think it was worth $35/person.

Well...I don't know if you deserve to have that title as of yet. First off the décor, I'm a big fan. The orange-ish (I know not a word)/yellow hues and the brown give it a modern restaurant feel, it doesn't feel like you're inside of a cheesy buffet. The tables are set up in ways similar to some restaurants in town and they actually give you water in a bottle (whether its really tap or not) instead of just slamming a glass of water on the table and having to refill it with the old school yellowish clear water pitcher that's been used 7,498 times and probably not washed, very refreshing. Not to mention the service was pretty good. Everyone that worked there was quick and attentive so I like that as well.  Second, this may not mean anything to anyone but they have a bathroom inside the buffet. I find that to be huge. It's not vital but listen the last thing I wanna do after I've been cracking crab or eating something else with my hands is dig in my pocket for my receipt, walk out of the buffet in the casino to the nearest bathroom, and then come back just to stand near the exit and convince the people there that I was already in there and just had to use the bathroom. Is it really that big of a deal? No, but as with other things if it requires less effort on my part, then I'm all for it.  Finally is the food which I'll have to split into two parts: the quality and the setup. The food quality kind of disappoints. The food selection is alright, the side dishes were okay, and all the meats I tried at the carving station were chewy and tough.  The fruit and  vegetable section was impressive but the overall quality of food was less than stellar. It was not as good as the buffet dinners at the M or the Bellagio. Maybe it was an off night because I keep hearing nothing but good things about the dinner and the brunch but I just felt very dissatisfied by the food quality.    The setup is different, I like it but I don't. I would say that a good part of the buffet has dishes that come in tapas style or small single servings in these little mini pot like things. So lets say you want soup, it already comes in a mini pot with a handle. You want shrimp cocktail there's two small ones in a bowl with cocktail sauce at the bottom and a small lemon. This is a good idea in theory and saves the company money. It's a good idea if you just like to graze and taste and you're not exactly sure what you want, it gives you a little taste of everything. It also saves the company money from people like my friend greedy Nick who piles on 17 shrimp and a glob of cocktail sauce knowing damn well all he's going to eat is four shrimp.   However, for people like me I usually know what I like and sometimes I like to go to just one item and eat all of that. Well that's kind of difficult to do with these small little bowls and pots. You could try to load them all on your plate but you'll maybe get about 5 small bowls without having to do a juggling act. You might think, well that's not too bad, but it just gets annoying. What if I feel like just eating shrimp or crab claws in those little pots. It's like finding a certain chip you like and only being allowed to put five on your plate and having to get up and walk back to the kitchen and go to the bag for five more chips. I know my inner fat kid is coming out. So you may be wondering is it really that big of a deal? Not really, but I get my exercise else where and then after I'm lazy ...just let me get a bigger serving so I can save the exercise for later.", "Date": "2011-05-03", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Thomas", "ReviewID": "yUhOLQ23Og3qM9o9lFeMmw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Best buffet in Vegas that I've had.

They did have the not so normal, Kale salad and a cheese section. Also, at this station is some cold meats and smoked salmon, which is an upside in comparison to others. Also, they have a juice station, which included; watermelon drink, strawberry banana juice etc.   The American section had the usual carving station that had sausages, beef, ham, chicken and the norm. The highlight of this section, which is the most popular item perhaps, is the Bone Marrows. A mountain of gelatinous fat on roasted bones, what is not to like. I just found this to be okay, but I know that others may find it more exciting than how I actually found it to be.   The Asian section came with the usual, Sushi, noodles, fried rice, broccoli beef. The highlight in this section is probably the Korean Short Rib BBQ. I know for a fact that a pound of uncook ribs goes easily for $10 a pound, when at the wicked spoon comes in heaps. The Ribs was exactly how it supposed to be, tangy, sweet and delicious.  The dessert bar is big. A  variety of dessert. A definite standout is the chilled white chocolate cake that is filled with passion fruit crema - Excellent!!  The lunch deal which was around $26 plus tax is definitely a great deal. Although from what I heard, the price doubles during dinner because at that time seafood is available.  I recommend this and agree that this just might be the best buffet. Located at the Cosmopolitan Hotel, which in my opinion is the best hotel at the strip at this moment.

I remember being extremely excited for about 20 minutes while running around and grabbing everything I could see.

Not only were the lines never ending but dinner cost a whopping $40 per person! I thought,  Maybe they have something really special?   NOT.   Not only were they running out of food left and right (I never got to try the smoked salmon, chocolate croissants or several other entrees) but the food was mediocre at best. I was so disappointed! Their desserts sucked...again. The best thing is the gelato.  Most of the options left were bread-based. (I got so mad at my boyfriend for filling up on pizza...then I realized I'm crazy and should let the man eat what he wants.)  Overall I like the idea of Wicked Spoon better than the reality of it.  I felt ripped off and I'm really upset that they didn't replace a lot of their entrees so the rest of us could try them. If you go, GRAB EVERYTHING YOU SEE! Don't make the mistake I made and say  Oh, I'll try that next.   I was so mad I was contemplating stealing little pots and pans from the tables around me.

Often new buffets are great when they open, they get a good reputation and then start cutting.  I'm praying this doesn't happen here.  First off, they are one of the first to care about presentation.  I don't mean of the space, I mean the food.  I think it is so smart the way that they serve each option in it's own little dish.  If you want shrimp it is served in a shot glass with 2 shrimp and a little cocktail sauce.  Yes, this means you can't really pile up a plate full of shrimp 2 miles high with a mound of cocktail sauce on top.  At the same time, do we really need that, and this presents so much better.  You can have as many shot glasses as you like, but it makes more sense for cost controls from their side, and it is better presentation altogether.  That goes for most of their food.   I also like this from a cleanliness factor.  I own a small Italian restaurant in town, and one of the things I hate about buffet's is the fact that everyone else is sticking their hands into food that we're all eating.  The way that Wicked Spoon presents their food stops a lot of this from happening.  Each person gets their own little portion so they don't get their dirty hands in everyone else's food.

Once you make your way to the second floor for the buffet, you are encountered with splashes of modern art, including oversized sculptures of high heels; very sexy! The whole vibe is very trendy, hip and modern. The staff is very friendly and helpful.   We were seated in our special req. booth without a problem.  We headed to the buffet and I couldn't believe the humungous selection of items! I read about the tiny dish distribution, so I knew what to expect, but I didn't think there would be such a variety. I have been to practically every buffet in Vegas, and usually make my way around the whole thing on the 1st round, but I only got through half of this place the first time around!  Almost every item I tried was highly delectable! One of my favs was the braised beef with pasta & mushrooms, yummmmy! The roast chicken and mashed potatoes were also divine, perfectly cooked and seasoned! Even the salad was above the norm, with tasty, high quality, applewood smoked bacon.  It seemed like every dish was made of the finest quality of ingredients. This was a major bargain, 20 bucks for a gourmet lunch with endless, delicious selections!   The only negatives were the mac & cheese, which lacked seasoning & the santa fe style corn bread bake, not my thing, food labels would have been helpful here.  The desserts were beyond amazing as well, the salty peanut & pistachio ice cream tasted like they were homemade, and those madelines were mighty tasty.   I highly recommend this buffet!!

A food waster like me who just likes to try one bite of each thing, this made me feel less guilty not eating everything.  The lines can be quite long, however, our group of 7 only waited about 30 minutes on a Saturday night. Because it was a  holiday weekend , they upped the charge to $45 a person. Quite pricey, and definitley not worth it for me. No difference in food, except the cashier mentioned there was turkey.  We sat at a high table which made it a bit tougher to get in and out, but appreciated the decor and set up of this place.  Buffets are a waste of $ for me, as I don't indulge in prime rib and crab legs like the majority of people. However, my girlfriends said the prime rib was one of the best they had (not just at a buffet), and enjoyed the crab legs.  I sampled just about everything except for the meats. There is an Asian station with LA Kalbi, various meats with veggies, but I only wanted to try their salt and pepper calamari. Waited nearly 10 minutes for it, but it was worth it. You get about 3 pieces in a little cute frying basket. They were typical calamari, but good to have as part of the meal. The sushi here is absolutely terrible. The rice is overcooked and hard, possibly from staying out so long.  They had a variety of meats and cheeses, that I enjoyed, although I wish there was some bread or crackers to enjoy it with. Their clam chowder was really good too. My favorite of course was the pizza, which are tiny slices, perfect for me. There was a french onion, sausage and veggie, and a margherita. All very tasty. The stromboli was really good too.  Their shrimp and grits, although looks really good, the grits were way too salty for me. I was super bummed they didn't have the bone marrow everyone raved about, and was dissapointed with the mac and cheese station. Although it's really cool to have any type of protein, veggie, and cheese in your mac and cheese, it was just typical orecchietta pasta, pan cooked with pasta and meats. Very heavy, and a larger portion than I had expected.  Their dessert station was sub-par, but did enjoy the choices of having a scoop of gelato. Had 3 different kinds, and the coffee was my favorite.  Unfortunately, our waitress was MIA the whole night. We got our drinks in the beginning, and over an hour later, we had to flag her down for a refill.  Overall, a decent experience.

I'm pretty sure if the uneducated food preparer at Wicked Spoon took a crap on their plate, these Cosmopolitan fanatics would still give rave reviews.  With that said, the dining area is a modern style setting. The floor is well lit and the waiters/waitresses are polite/professional. The drinks offered is pretty much the same across the buffets in Las Vegas. For those self proclaimed  buffet connoisseurs  will argue that there's fresh squeezed juice and etc, no one goes to a buffet for juice and if they do, they are as about retarded as individuals calling themselves  buffet connoisseurs.   Dinner per person is over forty bucks per head. The price you pay for is not worth due to the lack of quality and variety given.  When viewing photos of this establishment, you will notice most foods come on a small dish. This is very important to know because Wicked Spoon controls their portions and waste. Because of these small dishes, usually the hot dishes dry and shrivel up. If they're controlling portions and waste well they are doing a good job because each plate I had went to waste and I didn't feel bad because it wasn't much.  There's a salad/bread/cheese section. The salads are pre made onto this small dish. You can't make your own salad. For those ranch lovers, bring your own ranch. This place don't have ranch.  On a Friday night, there were not king crab legs. Their was snow crab legs however it appeared old due to the discoloration. The person who cut the crab legs also did a bad job, due to the difficulty of removing the crab meat. The sushi was pathetic, go to 7 eleven for sushi, not this place. There is a station where a cook makes a seafood sauté for you. That is the only thing worth your money. If you're looking for seafood, you get better seafood, with a cheaper price at Red Lobster. Yes this place is that bad.   The meat section of the buffet consists of pork shoulder, beef top sirloin, sausages, leg of lamb and turkey. NO PRIME RIB. The meats were subpar, and dry. I've found better quality meats elsewhere for 19.99 during lunch. Very very disappointing.   The Asian section consists of less than a dozen items which include fried rice, noodles, Kung pao and other items which did not look appetizing and dried up. Hint hint, if your looking for Asian, Panda Express.  The Italian section consists of pizza and dried and hard pasta and risotto in those small trays. They make Olive Garden look freaking authentic. Better yet, Chuck e Cheese has better quality food then these dishes left on the warmer top.  Dessert is average compared to other buffets on the strip.  Overall, save your money and go elsewhere. I had a difficult time eating knowing I spent almost fifty bucks for crap food. If you're looking for expensive crap food, come here. If you don't know what good food is, come here and you may like it.

Maybe it was on the salty side but other than that, it was pretty good.  There was a vanilla infused beet salad that was almost like a dessert.  I do like a good beet salad so this was a treat.  There was some Thai green curry that had some good flavor going on.  Coconut up front.  Curry spice on the back.  I just wish there was more beef.  I think my favorite from the serving line was a little smoked sausage with a nice snap.  My main complaint here is the freshness of the food.  Some of what I tried was really quite dried out.  The gnocchi with bolognese had almost no sauce left having been sucked up by the gnocchi which were then dried.  The shephards pies were mostly all burnt on top.  I had to look for one that at least still looked like mashed potatoes on top.  There was an Asian chicken dish that seemed moist but had so much skin and fat that after I pushed it aside I was left with little actual meat.  I did not care for the bone marrow.  That is more of a personal taste thing than it is a knock against this establishment.  I had never had marrow and was not expecting the gelatinous nature of it.  At least I tried it.  For people who are into that sort of food, they serve it here.  Enjoy.  Dessert looked great.  And for the most part it was all pretty good.  But again it seemed like it all was sitting out a while.  The mouse cakes were spongy and chewey. So was the banana macaron.  The chocolate covered strawberry was under ripe but still good.  My favorite dessert of the night was a pistachio cream eclair.  That was an interesting little take on one of my favorite of any desserts.  I only wish it was bigger that my little finger.  Unfortunately I was not able to sample all the food here.  I have a shell fish allergy and shell fish happens to make up a large percentage of the offerings at Wicked Spoon.  The crab legs looked average and smelled fresh.  I hear the shrimp balls were good and my eyes would back that up.  I am not used to this type of high end dining on the Strip.  I am more of a  support your local Station Casinos  kind of guy.  The small plates at Wicked Spoon that then receive smaller plates with yet smaller food is a turn off.  With some fancy foot work and putting my old Tetris skills to work I was able to fit maybe four or five foods on my plate at a time.  I prefer where I can just dump a spoon of this and a spoon of that and have half the offerings in one go.  Trying to place plates on plates just seems a waste of dishes.  Job security for the folks in the back I guess. And then there are the wine bottles, water bottles and drink menus on each small table making for little space to put all of your plates once you are done with them.  There is even less space when the bussing staff does not remove your used dishes by the time you get back with your next round of stacked servings.  I like the idea Wicked Spoon is going for here.  But at nearly $40 per person, I would like to see the execution improve.", "Date": "2015-03-18", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Laura", "ReviewID": "-JtLvNopUkZoyWDFsz26dA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I love the Cosmo, so why not give the buffet a try.

For their Chinese food, they even had it in take out boxes! They had mini pans for their  angry mac and cheese.  Everything was really decorated!

I think what sets this buffet apart from its competitor at Caesars is that the price is a little bit more reasonable and the service was phenominel in my opinion.

Maybe not as big as selection as Bacchanal during dinner time, but it was great nonetheless. the Asian/Sushi/Seafood selection was a little week in my opinion but regardless, it was still a delicious dining experience.

Their price has recently gone up to $35. I think there are other buffets in Vegas which have better tasting food for less price. At first, the small dish thing looks nice. But here are some of my observations.  Because most of the dishes are in its own small dish, all the food seems to be cold, from the lobster bisque I had to potato gatin.. also, since they are already portioned out, there is no way for you to try just a bite to see what something tastes like. So I ended up taking, but only taking one small bite and not finishing the rest because it either did not taste to my liking. Waste of food. The other thing is that there is only so many small dishes you can carry. So you end up taking a lot of trips to the bar.  There were 3 things I really wanted to try from reading the reviews here... the crab claws, risotto, shu-mai.  None of those things were available. In general, most of the dishes were very salty or very sweet.  The lamb at the carving table was really tough and not edible. And the chocolate used in the desserts seemed like plastic.  For me the best dishes were the cold shrimp cocktail (the shimp was bing and plump), and the spinach salad. Other than that, the food you get at the buffet at Green Valley Ranch is much more tasty (and cheaper too!)", "Date": "2011-05-09", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Steph", "ReviewID": "jm3BJE4SftVGCoOjoen-IA", "Overall": "2", "Content": "I came here on New Years Day this year with some girlfriends after a long night of going out. This, we learned, was a bad idea.   We were stoked and heard great things about Wicked Spoon being a must-go-to spot in Vegas. For a holiday, the wait wasn't bad at all (maybe 10 minutes)! Our waiter was super enthusiastic and great. The restaurant is very nicely decorated inside; has that upscale Vegas, bright lights thing going on.   Food was just okay in my opinion. I tried pretty much everything from all the sections they had. I would say everything is presented very nicely, but the taste was just average. But I was not quick to judge because the dessert area looked awesome. Then, I was slightly disappointed when I tried a couple of the pastries and gelato. Pretty plain and like any other chocolate mousse and pistachio gelato you could find. I guess I had high expectations because I paid a good chunk of money for this buffet.   I will give it another chance next time I am in Vegas though, because our group was super tired from the night before. We basically all fell asleep at the table after we ate. I can't tell if it was food coma-ing or just being super dead from the night before.  Overall: Wicked Spoon, you disappointed me, especially on a holiday. I expected more. Also, the prices are hiked up during holidays...no fun. Maybe I'll get the unlimited mimosas next time for the additional money and make it a boozy brunch. Technically if you pay $40 for brunch and have about 8-9 mimosas, they're only $4-$5 each, in addition to the food!

The best thing here was the risotto and the poached egg on a toasted English muffin. The desserts were nice as well, but they were very similar to the things featured at the Bacchanal.

Sure, some of the plates are served  tapas style,  but honestly, they were nothing special. And since we arrived around 10ish, I didn't even see any shrimp nor crab legs! I thought to myself,  honestly, $42 for brunch items???    Luckily, we were taking our time, so when we were about to leave (1130ish,) I heard someone yelled out  they're started serving crab legs and shrimp!!  So I finally got to enjoy what I really came here for... except, the crab legs were just ok, not as juicy as I expected, plus, the shrimps weren't even peeled.

Unlike any other buffets I had ever tried,  wicked spoon  offers an incomparable dessert station like I've never seen.   I think of all the Cosmopolitan restaurant collection,  Wicked Spoon  is probably by far the least of my favorite.

Usually this needs to be earned through multiple visits, but I have to say that I was blown away by this buffet. It is not just your typical buffet where selection is the key factor in its success.   The Wicked Spoon earns its stripes due to the stylishness that it presents its dishes. You feel like the offerings here are items that could be served a la carte at a great restaurant, as opposed to being just one choice in a buffet line.  First off, the ambiance in the RESTAURANT sets the tone. You actually have placemats for your plates and water is presented in a large glass bottle.  I went to Wicked Spoon for the dinner buffet ($29) and was amazed by the menu offerings. I like that this place does not stick to a certain menu. If the preparation for a dish is not good, they are willing to chuck it in favor of something else.   But what struck me is that this place may take something as simple as mac & cheese and jazz it up with a gourmet spin. It also helps that they serve it in untypical individual pot dishes. It makes you feel like it was made specifically for you. A departure from those large buffet servers.  They have a variety of cuisines offered here. Asian, Italian and Creole notably are featured. Again, I like the little touches here. I love that they put the curry tofu into a mini Chinese takeout box. This place also introduced me to the concept of charcuterie which I was familiar, but yet to try. And I have to say pork rillettes is one of my new favorite food things.  Nothing at the Wicked Spoon seems typical. That would be obvious by the offering of a selection of chocolates and gelato at the desserts table. When have you ever seen gelato at a buffet?

How great is it that I can find bone marrow in a buffet, and I don't have to go to either a French restaurant or a steak joint for it?!  I love that everything is portioned controlled.  Yeah, it would suck to be their dishwasher and you may only be able to fit 4 ramekins worth of food onto your plate but you won't look like a Fat Assssss for sure (unless you've got awesome balance and a waitressing background and can carry 4 or 5 plates to your seat like ME).   They have food that I've never seen in any other buffets:  Bone marrow - my dad actually makes it better but this was still tasty and I could go back for eighths if I wanted.  Fried oysters - YUM!  Lobster risotto - YUM!  supertenderandohsodelicious Short ribs - YUM!  othertenderporkwithcollardgreens - YUM!  Korean short ribs - YUM!  Primerib sliders - you get the idea!  and like, a shit ton of other YUM! stuff (sushi, pizza, asian fares, bread and cheeses, pitas with hummus or tabouli, salads, tapas type foods, a carving station, full dessert bar).    Their gelato in the dessert section alone is worth it.  And it's not even just the usual boring strachiatella or chocolate flavors, they have blood orange, raspberry, strawberry and balsamic.  I died and went to heaven.  On a side note, a lot of the food was rich in that there is a lot of fat, cream, cheese, fried in oil, type of foods there.

And yes, it is wicked delicious.  TL;DR: eat selectively, and share when possible. Even when the items are pre-portioned into small plates, sharing is feasible and allows you to strategically sample the endless dishes.  =Round 1: Apps & Veggies= (++) Shrimp & grits with beer blanc - Subtly cheesy grits and plump shrimp, with boozy-augmented flavors. I like the incorporation of new dimensions on the otherwise simple comfort food classic (+++) Cipollini onion with pinenut praline, Mandarin, & candied pumpkin seeds - It seems like it would be an Onion prank that one of my favorites of this famous buffet be... an onion. Pun intended, but the interplay of sweet, nutty, and fruity was indeed quite memorable (+++) Vanilla infused beet salad with stacciatella cheese & hazelnut vin - Another fascinating vegetarian masterpiece. I had to squint to taste the vanilla, but the incorporation of hazelnut was creative, an avant-garde culinary concept I've seen only at high-end restaurants (++) Kale salad with ginger dressing & spiced pepitas - Somewhat too heavy on the dressing, but tasty. Would likely please kale non-enthusiasts (+) Bourbon glazed carrots - Too much sugar and too little bourbon; nonetheless still a thoughtful rendition on carrots  =Round 2: Seafood= (+/-) Seared salmon cauliflower puree with blistered tomatoes - Salmon was dry and inconsistent (friend's piece was grossly undercooked). Also unimpressed with the tiny smudge of cauliflower puree (+++) Made to order seafood - Cooked to order with your choice of shrimp, molluscs, and fish paired with scampi or garlic white wine sauce. I think this is the omelette station at brunch; the fact that this replaces it for dinner makes the price difference well worth it. The cooks were very friendly, generous with the seafood, and helpful in making it ultra customized (a bit spicy, extra garlic, and no salt with white wine sauce was my favorite!). Man do omelettes seem lame now  =Round 3: Meat= (+/-) Lamb leg with rosemary & garlic - I was excited for lamb, but it ended up being tough, dry, and lacking flavor. Could at least use more rosemary and garlic to distract (+) Prime rib - Quite dry and not remedied by the au jus, which was also placed under the heating lamp making the spoon too hot to hold (+++) Celeriac polenta with short ribs - Eat this instead of the prime rib! Tender, flavorful short rib cuts balanced with an earthy infused grainy polenta (+) 5 spice pork belly - Honestly I was skeptical of the Chinese food, but this was an interesting flavor profile addition roast pork. It also has more layers of alternating crispy, lean meat, and fat than what I'm used to (-) Bone marrow - From the rare times I eat bone marrow, I remember it being much tastier. This mostly seemed like a maple BBQ sauce on a fatty vehicle (++) Jerk chicken - Unexpectedly, the chicken turned out to be the star of the carving station. Roasty and multidimensional from spices  =Round 4: Pasta= (-) Angry mac & cheese - I guess the chipotle addition and crispy garnish are novel, but nothing interesting and it's very dry for mac & cheese. Makes me angry that everyone likes this so much (++) Trofie pasta w/ kale pesto & Italian sausage - The al dente texture is so perfect with the kale pesto, which is light and slightly nutty. Paired with an umami Italian sausage for oomph (-) Tortellini with tomato fondue & fried basil - Meh, typical pasta in my opinion  Round 5: Dessert (++) Blueberry cake - I like how the blueberry is not too sweet (+) Opera cake (+) Strawberry cheesecake (+) Almond apricot torte (++) White chocolate & apricot mousse cone - I thought this would be gimmicky, but the combination of thin chocolate surrounding apricot mousse is delicately on point (+++) Mango & passionfruit zenith cake - Most beautiful item of the buffet! The texture is a little reminiscent of meringue; also, it's an amorphous blend of cream, plain sponge cake, and pieces of fruit, more attenuated than full-on fruit cake (+++) Tres leches - Mmm, deliciously alcoholic  Surprisingly, the much-anticipated carving station was underwhelming as much of the meat was dry and lacking flavor. Instead I was most impressed by the various vegetable dishes, which remind me of the fancy novelties crafted in the realm of fine dining.   ~$42 for weekday dinner buffet is a good deal; however, prices are marked up on weekends as are all the Vegas buffets.

I was craving for oyster and king crab legs so I called to make sure that had that for dinner before I really invested. The operator said yes and I was more than happy to give it a try. I have been to Bacchanal buffet before for dinner on weekends and it was phenomenal. But Bacchanal was $14 more expensive and because Wicked Spoon confirmed they had what I wanted with a cheaper price then why not.  I arrived around 4:45pm and they opened at 5pm. So there were about 4 parties before me. We were able to start our dinner right at 5pm. However, the seafood station looked pathetic. There was no oyster nor king crab legs. All they had were snow crab legs. And they were one of the worst crag legs I had ever eaten. Well I visited from the Midwest so I tasted enough bad crab legs to confirm this was one of the worst. The crab was served chilled. They cut it in half so it was more convenient to eat. However, because of that, they lost all the sweetness of the meat and they just tasted bland. My mom is very easy to pleased and she even said it was even worse than casino buffet in St. Louis, MO. Beside the bad crab legs, I tried the shrimp cocktail, it was not bad but it just can't blow your mind away. Shrimp ceviche tasted ok, not bad not great.   Pretty much done with the seafood station, I thought maybe other food were much better because so many people recommended this place. I tried to convince myself that $90 dinner for two would be worth it. But hell no, carving station was just average. The meat was chewy. There were about 4-5 dishes in Asian station and they didn't even look appetizing. All the Asian choices you can just dine at any Chinese buffet for a much cheaper price. For Las Vegas casino buffet, I expect more than that.   Salad station and bread and cheese looked ok. I didn't even bother trying. Who wants to pay $90 for salad anyway?  Their dessert station looked amazing but variety of cakes. I tried some of them but my favorite was raspberry lava chocolate cake. Ask them to put a scoop of ice cream on top and it is heaven.

It seemed to be the perfect occasion to splurge on a buffet.  Of course for my very first meal, it had to be between Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon.  I had eaten at Bacchanal on my previous Vegas vacation, so by default - Wicked Spoon it was!  I was so thrilled to finally have the opportunity to try this elusive gluttonous foodie heaven.  The buffet is very pretty and tastefully decorated.  The servers are very friendly and attentive.  Unfortunately, the food was not memorable at all.  I wanted to love it so hard, but sadly, it did not live up to my expectations. I had 5 rounds at the buffet - yes 5!  I started off at the meat carving station - the beef roast was very good, but the asparagus was a little woody.  The thick cut bacon was not nearly as good as the bacon at Bacchanal - it was not even thick and there wasn't enough smokiness to it.  It just tasted like any regular pork belly.  Even though the beef was good, I decided that it did not warrant a return trip to the carving station.  I also had the fried chicken wings, which were decent, but not crispy enough.  Kinda under seasoned and the sauce selection was sadly very limited.  There was BBQ, ketchup, and something else.  You would think that a place like Wicked Spoon would be a little more creative and playful.  For round 2, I did the breakfast part of brunch - I had some carnitas benedict fusion dish - which was not very good - too salty and the carb (I forget the name of it) was far too hard to even cut - I didn't eat it.  The guac was good though, so at least there was that.  I also had the fruit cup, sriracha watermelon (weird), and watermelon-apple juice blend (which was not so flavorful and had me wishing that there were other juice options).  Once again, Bacchanal beats Wicked Spoon out here.    For round 3, I had the oxtail  pho .  First of all, the noodles were not even pho.  They were a different type of thick Vietnamese rice noodles - called bun.  Not the same as pho - don't try to trick the customer, Wicked Spoon!  The broth was oxtail and wasn't made to order - there was a big vat of soup that you serve yourself.  The condiment bar for the pho was abysmal.  The  beansprouts, cilantro, and green herb (I don't know what it is called in English) were not fresh at all.  Some of the stuff was BROWN.  No bueno.  Also, it's very inaccessible, you really need to reach to get stuff and for me, it was a huge struggle.  However, gotta give them props for the phenomenal roasted bone marrow with crostini.  That was my favorite thing of the meal.  Absolutely delicious!  That was the only item that I came back to the buffet a second time for.  For round 4, I tried some of the Asian stuff - sushi (don't get it - it's all rice), pot stickers (good, but not worth wasting your calories on), some sort of sweet and sour chicken with rice (don't get - the rice was hard, the chicken was not hot), chicken wings (decent), and of course more bone marrow.  All in all, pass on the Asian section.  Finally, round 5 consisted of desserts.  My fave was the carrot cake and gelato bar.  This was the only section that beat out Bacchanal I think.  Since I'm not a huge dessert person, I will not be returning to Wicked Spoon and instead I will be going to Bacchanal.  Wicked Spoon had good variety, pretty presentation of the food, and a delicious dessert bar.  But, most of the food, with the exception of the bone marrow, was unremarkable.  Was it worth the $40+ ($35 + tax, tip)?  Probably not, to be honest.  I think that money would be much better spent at Bacchanal.  I wanted to love Wicked Spoon especially since I have heard about it for years, but I just wasn't impressed.

Bone marrow? Nope.  I guess the dessert section was decent. Saving grace really, otherwise I'd stick em with a cold hard one star. They had like cute gold dusted cake pops. And fancy gelatos hand scooped for you by an unenthused chef looking guy (at least he's got the poofy hat).  I guess the only fate worse than eating here is losing those 45 bucks to the casino. But at least you'd have vague amounts of fun doing so (assuming you play 45 bucks worth of penny slots or some shit ... if you a big balla, then the 45 bucks ain't even the small blind in your poker game, mirite?). I just feel disappointment and head-shakery. But yo if you like what all these other sheep have to say about the buffet then I say go for it bruh bruh. Try it out! Give it a whirl!

That's what I said all night long...at dinner... at one of my new favorite buffets on the strip.   Located on the second floor inside the most fabulous trendiest hotel on the strip, The Cosmopolitan,  you'll be in a chic ready-to-party mood the second you walk in.    We valet parked and a very friendly bellman welcomed Kate and I to the hotel. We sauntered in pass the changing laminated columns in the hotel lobby passing the Vesper bar which was sprinkled with a classy, hip styling crowd and the music was on.  Right next to it you will find the escalators that will take you to Food Heaven a.k.a. The Wicked Spoon.   House Cabrenet wine for only $20-nice reasonable option which we got!  A bottle of water is always on the table.   Service very attentive (unlike Bacchanal where our plates piled up and drinks took forever).  Lots of fabulous side dishes that we tried/shared mostly served  tapas  style which I prefer because it allows you to taste more and waste less:    Asian beef and vegetables lemongrass flavor this was tasty Lobster risotto was heavenly-my favorite!!! Polenta and roast beef-oh...yummy yummy Duck ravioli fabulous another favorite!! Truffle potatoes, hmm okay Salmon-sadly fishy Whipped potatoes, okay Mini prime rib panini's were amazing another favorite!! Sushi which was okay Creamed spinach-mmmm Fried oysters-good Lemon grass flavored stir fried rice was fluffy and fabulous. Gnocchi with ricotta sounded good was just okay Shrimp cocktail-two tiny shrimp in a shot glass with sauce and a slice of lemon Cheese plate and parmesan crisps-perfect compliment to my wine  The Asian section had servings in tiny to-go chinese boxes-that was clever.   Another station was the made to order mac n cheese, (literally a bar with toppings to choose from) I didn't stand in line for this one.  Seafood was crab legs and some ceviche, side dishes of BBQ shrimp and grits, and other side type of seafood dishes-but no stand outs for me.  For meat eaters they served prime rib, several styles of chicken, ribs, fried chicken served in tiny frying baskets and bone marrow.   Desserts were full of flavor. Here are some that jumped on my plate:  Chocolate Molten cake -served warm-good not fabulous but good Chocolate covered strawberries also dipped in oreo crumbs-mmm loved this Tiramisu-yes more more! Bon Bons gold dusted and on a stick-yes give me some mo! Opera cake-very good Pumpkin cheese cake-okay Pumpkin flan-yummy  I missed out on the gold leaf Macarons:(  boo hoo hoo!  Well I guess I will just have to go back!  Maybe we started dinner too late?  7:30? My advice come early!  $84 for two people not including wine. They didn't play any music like Bacchanal, no crepe stations, no Mexican food or Ramen station and the food options were not as grand as Bacchanal but the consistency and presentation of the gourmet dishes, the service and ambiance were all very good and worth a second trip-plus NO two-hour wait in a buffet line!

It had been over 10 years since I ate at a Vegas hotel buffet, but I figured I should give The Cosmopolitan a chance, since I've became a fan of their other offerings (like The Chandelier). Since I wanted to take advantage of that $22 brunch from 10a to 2p, I got here around noon.  If I arrived any earlier, I wouldn't have been hungry enough to sample a lot of their offerings.  In the end I took care of 5 plates, when including dessert.  On my first place, I piled up salad, fruit, a chicken salad slider, and shrimp cocktail (that come in plastic containers resembling shot glasses).  Then I got up to head towards the warm food area.  On my next 3 plates, I went with their chicken, pork, mac & cheese, korean ribs, fried rice, chow mein, and even threw in some bacon for good measure.  I know I had more than that, but I packed those ribs on twice and there were some other things I wanted to try, but didn't get to.    And for dessert, I went with strawberry balsamic gelato, a chocolate covered strawberry, and a macaroon.  If I had taken a look at the dessert area first, I probably would have cut back something else from that of my previous 3 plates. I wanted a lot more gelato flavors, since they have what looked like well over a dozen!  My advice: practice some self-discipline, take small portions, you can always have more of something later if you like it a lot.  As for me, I obviously had little self-control.

You really know how to impress! Located inside the gorgeous and very chic Cosmopolitan Hotel, this was our first time dining at their buffet. I can honestly say that it was the best buffet experience I have ever had!  We came for Brunch on a Friday around 10am. The line was very long which means popular and delicious! For $27 per adult it was an incredible meal. I've been to almost every buffet in Vegas over the last 7 years and this was the best one.  The food area was divided between breakfast and brunch sections. We started with eggs, sausages, bacon, waffles, maple syrup and smoked salmon bagels with divine whipped cream cheese. Croissants and cheesy hashbrowns and crispy chicken wings!  Next I headed over to the  brunch  section to look at the Asian items, pizza, prawns, fried chicken baskets, grilled salmon, desserts and a full Gelato bar that would put Jean Philippe to shame.  Once I discovered the thick cut applewood Slab Bacon at the Carvery there was no way I was ever looking back.   My husband and I looked at each other and exclaimed  Manny's!  after taking one bite. If you've ever been to Manny's Steakhouse in Minneapolis or The Strip House Steak House inside Planet Hollywood, it tastes just like the Bacon appetizers both of those restaurants have. Outstanding. And having it for brunch, even better!  I also had Prime Rib sliced nice and thin and just pink enough. The regular crispy bacon was good too!  Smoked Salmon was fresh and light and just perfect on my toasted bagel. The coffee was some of the best Buffet coffee ever. It was far superior to Bellagio and Wynn's coffee but I love both of those buffets too.   Dessert: I had a maple pecan bread pudding with Salted Caramel Peanut gelato. Mini Tres Leches cake and chocolate covered strawberries topped it off for me. So much food I couldn't finish it. Even the orange juice was divine.   Interior: One of the most beautiful interiors I have ever seen, with such thoughtful attention to detail like amazing light fixtures (sculptures, if you will) and nice large tables and chairs that were so comfortable.

Noisy but not too much, it's a good setting for a loud group. Try to get a table on the right side, it's closer to the desserts, you won't regret it.  Lots of variety for every taste, most of it pretty good, and some interesting items I don't see very often, like bone marrow. I liked how they made everything easy to eat with their single serving portions, especially the crab shooters. You could actually eat crab without needing to pick crab parts off yourself afterwards.   I tried just about every dessert and if I hadn't already tried most of the other half of the buffet, I would have tried them all again. I had about 3 of those funny egg cups and couldn't muster up the patience to wait 10 minutes for the berry cobbler that comes fresh out of the oven, so I took another egg cup instead.

I believe that it is an experience meant for mass-consumption of an unhealthy amount of food that is never truly spectacular and provides for a lackluster experience that is meant only to fill your stomach. That being said, I was won over by Wicked Spoon. It featured food in new and creative ways while preserving quality over quantity. Needless to say, it wasn't the most remarkable dining experience you will ever have, however it will make you think  did I really just go to a buffet?   Set in the recesses of the Cosmopolitan resort, getting there can be a challenge in itself. Whoever designed Las Vegas resorts to get you to set destinations clearly set a slot machine or a poker table in your way. Be prepared with some comfortable shoes, because no matter where you park your car or if you valet, the trek is clearly enough to burn off your first plate of food (I'm exaggerating here for the record). Yet if that isn't enough to deter you, the line to pay followed up by the line to be seated might be. Don't give up.   When you finally are seated, you are greeted by a diorama of epicurean treats that are hard to be rivaled. From the lighter fare to the more delectable treats, our brunch buffet was among the best I ever had. The smaller plates encourage variety and expanding your taste palate with bites uncommon to the normal buffet. Forget the mass produced scrambled eggs, the cold pancakes and such. Bring on the mushroom risotto with truffle oil, thick cut slow roasted bacon, or perhaps the desire for the gelato bar might arise.   The smoked salmon mousse in a cone could be passed up, the watermelon with feta and balsamic reduction right next door shouldn't be passed up. While simple, the crisp flavor of the watermelon is complemented with the salty feta and the sweet tart of the vinegar. While it might be over in a bite, I guarantee you will be back for a couple more of them. The bacon was heaven. Not too fatty or oily, but still offering the silky saltiness to go with your made to order omelet.   Be sure to save room for dessert because the gelato was extremely well done along with the other small morsels set away enough to avoid the drool that will escape your mouth.   Service was good. Who would have thought I would be talking about service at a buffet!? Yet here I am including the fact that the staff quickly cleared plates, were incredibly pleasant, and never let the water glasses go full. Service usually is tolerable at a normal buffet, Wicked Spoon clearly takes it up a notch.  While the buffet has become an integral part of Las Vegas cuisine, don't skimp on the $9.99 buffet that might dote the landscape.

Not just variety, but quality variety.  It's nestled in the  back  of the Cosmopolitan. So I feel like it's in an overlooked spot in an overlooked casino? There are signs, but you'll need to follow them upstairs and through some hallways in order to reach Wicked Spoon. While it is out of the way, it's also not right off a casino floor, which is nice, a bit less hectic.  It markets itself as a little more of a foodie buffet, and I think it's delivers. For Sunday brunch, they had things like gnocchi in tomato sauce, polenta with braised lamb, and wild mushroom risotto. There was their  wicked  fried chicken and mac & cheese (legitimately spicy, in the case of the mac & cheese), as well as a large buffet of cold cheeses and meats. Good shrimp dumplings and dry fried green beans were also available. While you could get  American  breakfast, I was uninterested in the face of their Italian and Asian counters. There's also several carving stations with good beef and pork options. I was stuffed by the time we got around to dessert, where there's a gelatto counter and dozens of small cakes, cookies, macaroons, and even bitter chocolate cakes, swimming in mini-cast iron skillets of caramel.  For about $15 extra, you can get unlimited mimosas or bloody marys, which, we figured, meant we'd have to get two drinks over the course of the meal to break even. Easy deal when you consider the waiter was bringing two at a time for everyone at the table...we had a forest of mimosas by the end of the meal. So even if the drinks were a bit weak by reports, we had no problems getting them.  Brunch ran me (sans alcohol option) about $38. Was it a lot for brunch? Maybe. But I'd never been to a buffet before, as most of my Vegas trips are for conferences where lunch is provided and we're away from the casino floors and restaurants during the day.

The chimichurri sauce at the carving station is pretty flavorful though. Fair warning! Your breath will not smell so heavenly after eating the chimichurri! I think what you have to keep in mind is that you're not only paying for the upper echelon of buffets. You are also paying for the experience. Your first point of contact is the hostess who rings up your bill and another hostess who takes you to your table- both accommodating, happy and super nice. Every waiter I've had goes above and beyond the norm. Now, if you would rather be left alone to eat in peace and rather not spend the $cA-chiNg$ for a higher end all you can eat....

I am a self proclaimed Vegas Buffet Expert.  For those old school people, you always still hear about the Rio Buffet being the best. Yes, it was 10 years ago. Times have changed and hotels are dumping serious money into buffets.    With all that being said I am going to have to say that the Wicked Spoon is probably rated as the #2 in my book. Being rated that high is pretty hard.   Here are some of the pros: The price is 25% less than the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars. If it were the same price i would have rated it one star lower.   Quality of food is really really good. Each item is very unique and made to perfection. I would say that this buffet typically has the best prepared food of any of the buffets.   Short lines due to its remote location.  Here are some of the cons: Getting to the hotel sucks, there is no easy way to get here so enjoy walking.   The food is great, but the selection is so so. It probably has one of the smallest selections compared to the other major buffets in vegas. I.E. Bacchanal, Wynn, M, Bellagio, (rio back in the day)   Final Thoughts: If you have not been to this buffet, you should. Its a path less traveled compared to the others and offers a really good meal. It may not have the largest selection, but it has the best tasting. With the pricing being more affordable than some of the others in its class, I suggest adding this to your list of buffets to go to in Vegas.", "Date": "2016-11-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ruth", "ReviewID": "Aokv71BxYLPmQi0mHwEqOQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I visited Wicked Spoon on Thursday July 7th for Brunch .

I'm not usually a dessert guy, but there was one dish from here that literally made me cry. True story. More on that later...  Wicked Spoon offers a smorgasbord of small plates that are decadently rich in flavor, calories, cholesterol and so on. Most of everything is plated beautifully so it's very pleasing on the eyes as well as your stomach. If it's not plated, it's in a small container that makes it easy to carry as well as to eat. It's definitely not a buffet that leaves a huge mess.   They have all kinds of protein from pork belly, kalbi-style ribs, lamb, prime rib etc... What also stands out from other buffets is that they serve bone marrows. Yes, that rich, fatty, oily, creamy part inside the bone that will ensure your arteries will clog, your blood pressure will rise and makes your brain say  Uncle  on the richness and fattiness on every single bite similar to Foie Gras. It's definitely not a food that one should eat everyday, but in moderation. Oh, but sprinkle some kosher salt and spread it on a cracker and it's irresistible.   They have seafood, salad, pasta, pizza, Chinese, Mexican, Italian and so on. Another plate that me and the Wifey kept going back for was the savory watermelon on a bed of Balsamic Vinegar topped with cream cheese was oh so good. It's a one-bite plate and everything comes together with a perfect balance and flavor note. It's also light so I didn't feel so guilty stuffing my mouth like a garbage compactor. Well...I probably had 8 plates of that thing.   I didn't try everything as I made sure to save room for desserts. The gelatos were on point and the Coffee-flavored gelato had nibbles of wafers in them giving it an added texture and flavor, which was a nice surprise. I also had the Thai Tea-flavored gelato and Wifey had the Pistachio.   And for me, the pièce de résistance was the White Chocolate Mousse Cake with Exotic Cream. Like I mentioned, I'm not usually a dessert guy and I shouldn't be eating desserts for personal reasons, but this one dessert was on another level. From just looking at it, it looks like a simple dessert cake with a gold leaf topping. But one bite took me to a happy place way back during my childhood that instantly made me think of my mom. I was crying with joy and happiness and even tried to prevent a tear from falling on the corner of my eye to no avail.   Every other bite could not stop the tear from falling onto my cheeks as I thought of my mom. This dessert literally reminded me of my mom. The sweetness was just right as it was not overly sweet. The shell of the exterior, the filling and the pie crust combined together with the tanginess of the sauce made a perfect blend that created a harmonious music in my mouth. All the components together was so perfectly balanced and easily ranked as one of the best desserts I've ever tasted.   Just thinking about it is making me tear up again.   *sigh*  For a dessert dish that makes me think of my mom is surely a special dish in my book.

I had read about how it's one of the better buffets in Vegas and, knowing me, I just can't resist following up on food hype :)  Pros:  * The price was pretty reasonable (compared to the other buffets in the area); for their dinner buffet, we spent ~$40/person.  * The service and ambiance were top quality - it's definitely more of the relaxing type of buffet (not a total zoo).  Very glamorous!  * The presentation of the food was beautiful! Dishes were individually portioned in either frying baskets or mini pans.  * They served up quality and unique dishes, e.g. Bone marrow, smoked salmon pizza.  * Their Tempura Calamari skewers and Grilled Salmon were especially delicious.  * And of course, I looved their dessert station! Macarons, mini chocolate cones, strawberry chocolates and many varieties of ice cream were all scrumptious.   Cons: * Selections were limited; disappointing assortment of sushi or sashimi (there were only about 4 types of sushi rolls and none of them were good). * The meat station - had the prime rib and, ugh, it was disgusting. The meat was done a little too rare, but maybe that's just not my preference. It was also cold and looked like it had been seating out a while.  * People were going nuts for their King Crab and other seafood items, which were placed together in this huge pile - didn't get why the fuss plus they were served icy cold.    Overall, Wicked Spoon's presentation is wonderful. I really appreciate the time they spend to make the food look so good; yet, if only they could spend an equal amount of time on the taste, as well as try to broaden their selections of food, it would really be a step up in setting them apart from the other buffets.

Plenty of variety for everyone to find something they love and could eat five servings of.  I found more than one item I could continue eating for a lifetime.

We were leaning towards Bacchanal, but my fella insisted on giving Wicked Spoon another try since we weren't really in the mood to stand in a long line for dinner. We arrived at 7:30 on a Saturday and there was no line at all. I have to admit, this scared me off a bit. This is peak buffet-eating time and there was no line, it just didn't seem right.   We paid and were seated within 2 minutes of arriving. Service was friendly, but we had to wait quite a bit of time to get drink orders in. On several occasions I had to ask other servers that were meandering around if we could order drinks and refills. After this coaxing our server did arrive and take our orders. We made sure to order refills as he was placing our drinks down after having to wait one too many times with nothing to drink. As a thirsty girl, that's a pet peeve of mine, keep those refills coming.  The food wasn't too exciting either. I actually had a hard time deciding on anything. I wandered around around much longer than I usually do at buffets and ended up with the same things over and over. The only things I had any interest in eating were the kalbi and assorted veggies I found on the line.  I don't see myself returning to this buffet any time soon.

Before we chow down, I decide to browse the buffet end to end snapping photos along the way.  You have your standard food stations-Japanese, Chinese, Carving station, Pasta, Pizza, and Flatbread, International, cold foods, breads, and salads, and on the far Right side of the dining room, Desserts and sweets.  Nice decor and great concept having individual portions of some of their selections, but it makes you wonder if and how long will they keep this concept....dishes will chip and break, and it will be a challenge to keep the mini pots and pans well maintained.   A few items were offered here that I haven't seen at other buffets: Lamb Ribs, Roasted Bone Marrow, BBQ Shrimp and Bacon and Cheddar Grits, Chicken Liver Mousse, Pork Rillettes, and even Fromage de Tete(Head Cheese)  A few of the Items still didn't have names,(like how Studio B was when they first opened) but luckily, I reconoticed just about everything that was offered.  Here's my Hits and Misses for the evening: Hits: Roasted Bone Marrow-Spread some of that goodness on toasted bread and top it off with parsley salad, red onion jam, and a pinch of salt...Addicting!  King Crab Legs- Leg Chunks de-shelled and individually plated, brushed with butter and herbs. Very sweet and tasty, also cost effective and visually smart. You don't see a swarm of people grabbing plates full like at Bellagio or Wynn, no messy hands or piles of crab shell at the table either!  BBQ Shrimp and Bacon and Cheddar Grits-Tasted as good as it sounds!   Fries with eyes -Crispy Fried Smelt with a pair of remoulades, regular and spicy-Crunchy goodness!  Lamb Ribs-well seasoned, nicely charred and fall-off-the-bone good!  Taleggio and truffle oil flatbread-anything truffle is BOMB!  Rillettes and Chicken Liver Mousse were pretty tasty too....     Misses: Dim Sum, 3 kinds-Siu Mai, Har Gao, and Sticky rice in lotus Leaf-go to chinatown Sushi-california, Shrimp tempura, and spicy tuna,-not too appetizing Risotto- Impossible to serve at a buffet unless done a la minute in small batches-it was gummy...  Desserts-Looked better than they tasted....especially the ones in the glasses and fancy containers..... Chocolate covered apples? what about caramel and candied apples? Mini pastries and desserts were sooooooSWEET, and so were the gelatos and sorbets-too much sugar and stabilizers... Crepes tasted like the packaged ones-cold and rubbery.

The variety of food selection was lacking.  I think it's about half the selection of Bellagio's.  The quality wasn't much to harp on either.  The cooked salmon was dry for example.

Although we've only ate at Bellagio before this, I see no reason to go here over Bellagio's buffet.  Bellagio's buffet is literally better in every regard in our opinion.

Being from Hawaii and coming over on Vacations Hawaii, we tend to stay in Downtown Las Vegas for most of our dining.  Similar to the majority I would guess. We headed out to the Wicked Spoon after a long day of shopping.  Originally I expected to have a stopover at our hotel to change clothes and was actually not happy about being in shorts and slipper for our dinner buffet.  I was glad to se numerous other people as the dinner progress to be in similar clothes.  Based on my friends despription of the dinner fair I was thinking everything was upper class, even the dining attire.  I guess they probably would want you to dress up but being Vegas, take anything. We got there at the start of their dinner buffet service.  Just after 5:00 pm.  Even though we were one of the first parties to arrive, they were prepped and ready for a hundred.   We did a quick walkthrough of the buffet to plan  our attack.  My goal was not to load up too much on the heavy foods and make sure I can try all the dishes that I wanted too.  Almost all of the dishes are presented like 5 star restaurant appetizers or sides.  Coming form CUT two nights ago I can honestly say they could have easily pulled their appetizers straght off these buffet lines. All the dishes were presented very elegantly.  A dish in their own.  My particular favorites were the shrimp and bbq, cowboy bacon on potato, soybeans, cheese platter, pig tail, and the decadent desserts.  The desserts were awesome.  I usually don't eat dessert in restaurant as I normally am too full, but I save space for them here.  I actually ate dinner, dessert, then dinner again.  I had to end on the king crab legs-----of course. They also have a special Happy Hour pricing for selct drinks and cocktails from the bar from 5:00 to ?.

Gambling was on the minus side, but fortunately I think the food we tried on our latest Vegas trip was on the plus side.  First off, the new Cosmopolitan hotel is absolutely gorgeous and stunning. Unlike the commercials, you won't see random cute animals running about with catchy music in the background, but if you appreciate abstract art, you'll feel right at home. Much of the chic decor has definitely influenced their buffet.   It's probably one of the most beautifully decorated buffets I've ever seen. This is from somebody who grew up on Circus Circus buffets as a kid. We've come a long way (shed tear). We came for dinner around 5pm on a Friday night and while there was a small line, it went by pretty fast. Soon enough, we were seated at our table.  As you may of heard or read, they do things a little differently here. Some of their dishes are served in small porcelain cups and trays, or stainless steel pots and miniature pans. I think it's a great idea to keep the freshness and integrity of the food -- such as the braised beef short ribs. While a bit on the rich and salty side, I thought it was a dish that rivaled that of many high-end restaurants.  Other favorites of mine include the prime rib, fish, and... wait for it, vegetables. Sometimes buffets go overboard with fancy dishes, but I like how this buffet executes their veggies -- like the green beans and brussel sprouts (gasp). The dessert station was fantastic. I liked the stacked squares of fudge and various mini cakes and tarts. My favorite was the gelato station, where you can tell that it was good quality.  But it wasn't without some misses, however. The supposed  crab  dish was pretty disgusting. Rubbery and chewy, pale-looking masses of meat, I'm not quite sure what type of crab this was from -- maybe some mutant crab that lived in the depths of the sea. The meat was taken out of its shell and sauteed in a sauce. No matter, it was bland anyway.   You won't find any of the long, dangling king crab legs that you're used to seeing in other Vegas buffets. They have mini pre-shelled crab claws served in small trays that come with a dab of cocktail sauce and wedge of lemon. It's okay, but you might need a few dozen of these just to get your crab fix.   In the end, I was pretty satisfied that I got my $27 worth for dinner. Service was excellent, and I like how they leave a bottle of cold water at your table so you don't have to keep asking for it.

Trust me.  The long version: We were super excited to try a new buffet in Vegas. Although we love the Wynn, we figured we should branch out with our most recent visit. The reviews on Yelp were all glowing, and the pictures were drool-inducing.  But maybe we should have headed the signs the gods were sending us not to go.  We got lost not once, but twice on our way there as no one in that complex seems able to give good directions and it is way out of the way in the bowels of the beast.  Seriously, there is no way you would be able to find it without directions. The signage was crap.  On to the food though.  By the time we finally arrived we were starving and ready to go. As per usual buffet routine, we each grabbed a tiny bit of everything during the first round (or as many bits as would fit on our plates). Here we encountered problem  #1.  Predetermined portions (unless small) should never be used in Buffets. particularly when they plate dishes on too big of plates and one can only grab one or two items on a trip.  For example, there were like three varieties of mac and cheese, none of which were good, yet we had to take three sizable ramekins to find this out. I hate throwing food out.  Problem #2. Yes, fusion is fun, but not every dish needs to be a  wow, i never thought those two things would go together!   Sometimes the classics are ok. Really. Dishes that fell into this category were so un-memorable I've forgotten them already, but trust me, there were quite a few.  Problem #3. Sushi. I agree, sushi really should not be a sushi dish.  But if you are going to serve it, and you are in vegas, home of the sushi buffet for some reason, you need to keep it fresh. Blegh.  And now on to the good things... Awesomeness #1 Marrow.  I know people have commented it on it many atime, but crap, it's so good.  Awesomeness #2 the dessert bar.  Oh my lord. Seriously. Next time it will be straight to this section. The sheer variety was awesome, but of all the pieces we tried, there was not one bad or even mediocre one.  The Lady Godiva Chocolate Lolis.....just think of super moist brownies with an amazing chocolate shell. And cheesecake with just enough lemon zest....dare I say it, better than homemade. And the homemade marshmallows will change your whole perspective on things. I could go on and on, and am very tempted to, but that would just be cruel.  Awesomeness #3 Best wait staff in a buffet.

I went here again and was surprised by how they raised the price to $35 when it used to be $28 (I believe). I expected this place to be in the same league as Wynn buffet because of the price but it was not even close to the same vicinity.  I still love how there is never a line even on a Friday evening. I guess people can't find it since it's quite a walk to find it. The style is chic and modern. I do love the water they serve! It tastes fresh and they provide a carafe so you don't need to ask for refills.  The presentation of food is very lovely- tapas style, served on individual plates. I think this is their way of saving money because you can only fit aboutt 2 or 3 of those small plates on your regular plate. Clever concept indeed!   The bad part is that the food just tasted... bleh. Even the snow crab legs were dry and lacked flavor. I did like a few dishes like their roast duck and the bone marrow which I have never seen at any other buffet.  I felt like I got full by trying food that I didn't really enjoy. The only great thing about this buffet is the desserts. The desserts are very pleasing to the eye and they have a wide selection. I love the chocolate covered strawberries and the gelato.

I had it bookmarked for over a year. We came on our last day which was Sunday night for dinner. It was a little bit over $50. Since for me that was expensive I decided to go all out and stuff my face!  Before I start talking about the food lets talk about the atmosphere there. It is very nice and elegant in there. Also they provide 2 big thing of bottled water. The crowd is very relaxed dressed casual.   Now lets talk food. I tried the following:   BBQ Shrimp- it came in a tiny pan. Comes with 2 shrimps smothered in what said was BBQ sauce but it was like a BBQ/cocktail sauce.   Crab legs- the beautiful part about these is that they are already open so you don't have to struggle trying to eat them.   Artichoke salad- delicious and fresh if you like artichoke  Asparagus Salad- Absolutely a must try. Fresh and the dressing on it is really good  Salmon with crunch on top- lemony and buttery and so tender. Cooked to perfection  Greek Salad- favorite salad of the night for sure. The combination of the vinaigrette, olive oil and lime juice was perfect.   Caesar Salad with tuna mackerel- had a weird taste didn't really like it  Shepherd's Pie- it came in a cute little pot. It was delicious. I had never tried Shepherd pie and I thought it was delicious  Spinach Cream- So good with a side of bread  Pork Loin- WOW! I wish I would've gotten a few extra slices but since there was an employee slicing it I was a bit shy to ask for more. It was so thick yet tender and full of flavor.   Bone Marrow- Personally I did not like it. It was my first time trying bone marrow and probably my last. The texture and flavor I just didn't like it.  Dirty Rice with dried fruit- also didn't like the combination of this  Risotto topped with parmesan cheese- another one of my favorites of the night. Great taste and combination  Sushi Rolls & Salmon individual sushi- I love sushi and I was a bit disappointed because they tasted like 7-11 sushi rolls.   Asian Noodles- by the time I got to this section I was already full but I still gave them a try. The noodles were great.   Beef Teriyaki with veggies- So good. The flavor was intense.   Green curry Rice- maybe I am not a fan of curry because I didn't really like it.   Dessert- Carrot Cake and chocolate covered strawberries   were really good but that's about it. They need to improve on their desserts.  Overall, I got my money's worth. I will definitely recommend this to friends and family.

The Wynn buffet and M buffet used to be tied for first, but Wicked Spoon DOMINATES!  They don't have all the typical things that any other buffet on the strip has, but the quality is so much higher, and the dishes they offer are definitely more unique!!!  This is quite random, but I have to say the best thing I ate at the entire buffet is their mini pecan pies in the dessert section... it was so good I wanted to go back the next day and ONLY eat that!  (Of course I didn't...)  They also have the most amazing array of chocolate-covered strawberries!  It's divided into 3 sections of ones with peanuts, oreos, and heath bars.  THEY ARE SO AMAZING my bf ate literally 35+ of them... kinda crazy and gross :) There are also chocolate covered pears!!!    Also they give you one complimentary mimosa, champagne, or bloody mary for the brunch meals!  There's a personal omelette bar that turns into a pasta bar at night I think... or maybe a salad bar... not sure!  I love how everything is divided into tiny portions, so you feel like it's individualized for you.  Also, it's perfect for me because I really just like to sample but not eat anything in particular, so they have a whole section of pastas put into miniture pots for you to try!  There's gnocchi, ravioli, polentas... it really helped my self control because I could share with my boyfriend without grabbing a bunch of food that looked good and just piling it only my plate and feeling to full too eat it in about 20 minutes.    Another thing I loved is the GELATO BAR!!!! it's so cool how there are really unique flavors like pink grapefruit... the PISTACHIO LITERALLY TASTED LIKE GELATO I HAD IN ROME... unbelievable!!!  It also comes in these really tiny scoops, so you are basically just sampling each flavor... PERFECTION.  I am definitely ditching all other buffets in vegas and only coming to this one... it's just not worth stuffing yourself unless you are going to do it with wonderful food!!!

I tried calling out to 2 of them but they just looked spaced out and kept heading wherever they were heading.  For almost an hour, I observed all the waiters walking around.  Most would blankly stare off into the distance, and despite being surrounded by people with piling dishes, they'd pick up a couple of things from a table that had already cleared out, and slowly disappear somewhere.  Or hang out with the cashiers.  At one point there were 8 workers just hanging out at the cashier table when there was not even a line... and meanwhile our section was full of customers and piling dishes.   Props to our waiter Cruz (who wasn't even really our waiter to begin with -- he was just the only one in our section actually collecting dishes and delivering drinks) for HAULING ASS and picking up everyone else's slack!!

I was too stuffed to get a good sample of everything, but I did leave satisfied. Service and ambiance was top-notch.   However, if you're looking for quality seafood (especially shrimp cocktails and mussels) or a large selection before dinner, Bachannal is still your choice.

I heard so much about this place that's why we were very excited when my girlfriend's cousin told us she's taking us here. My expectations were high.  6pm on a Wednesday night, we were lucky that we were seated right away because people started filling up the place. Our server was very accomodating but as much as he wants to attend to our needs right away, he can't because he was attending to more than 10 tables. Compared to other buffet restaurants, seems that they were short staffed.   Before I start getting food, I go around first to plan my attack. Except from desserts, nothing really made me excited. To be honest, I can't even remember what were my starters but I do remember there were a lot of goat cheese that made the buffet flat - stroganoff with goat cheese, goat cheese panna cotta, goat cheese risotto, goat cheese ravioli, etc.. What's with the goat cheese?  The meat station was a big disappointment. The beef ribs were tough and other cuts of meat were too salty. Nothing really enticing on the Asian cuisine station except for the shrimps but unfortunately, they were overcooked. It's good there was a fish station - ordered shrimps and scallops with butter, garlic and white wine. Cooks were very nice.  The dessert station kinda saved the day for me. Its not very often that you find good desserts in a buffet restaurant. We love the chocolate and cookie covered strawberries. They were huge and fresh. Cakes were nice too. How I wish, I started my dinner with dessert first.

It is about $36 for bunch $48 for brunch with unlimited mimosas and a little over $55 for dinner. The best deal for your buck is to come here for before 3pm but close to it for the unlimited mimosa brunch so you can get drunk and eat. The best part about doing a late lunch is that you pay brunch price but you get dinner food items. Dinner doesn't have unlimited alcoholic drinks which is why I rather do that.   Just eat all the crab legs and drink all the mimosas you can. Their Thai tea ice cream to finish it all off is also amazing.

Came here for breakfast and was impressed with the selection. Wicked Spoon has lots to choose from, breakfast items and non-breakfast alike. Some of the items were really good.

Throw in some horseradish, and call it fancy. Gross. Overall, you'll find some good stuff here. You'll also find some bad stuff. It's a buffet, so not everything is going to please you. But in the end it has something for everybody.   Now for the miscellaneous stuff. Breakfast was reasonably priced at $39/person. Restaurant was clean, and food was replaced as needed. Server was absent most of the time, but that's fine. I don't like being bothered when I eat. Except when I need a drink refilled.

The roast beef was just how I liked it cooked, and they had a wide variety of desserts!! Even macaroons!!

BTW, it wasn't very busy but perhaps its the fact that the COSMO is still a pretty new hotel and maybe no one knew about the buffet? Nice though since we didn't have to wait long on a Sunday evening.  Now this isn't my favorite Vegas buffet but I just enjoyed it because it was different and unique. It was nice and clean and the food was presented in these cool, plates, small pans, and were portioned controlled. Everything tasted good, but the one thing that stood out was the crab in cajun butter. I am just salivating thinking about it right now as I type. Yes, seafood is a must have for any Asian person at a Vegas buffet. Check my pics, pretty awesome huh?  Overall, I give a solid 5 stars. The atmosphere was great, and our server was amazing and friendly. We practically chatted it up with her, and she was nice enough to give us tips on where the hot spots were and what places to hit up (even on a Sunday). She was amaze! Food was delicious, clean, and presented well. You can't go wrong with checking out the Wicked Spoon. But if your lazy about going up a lot, you might not like it as the plates are small and everything on the buffet line is in a separate pan or mini plates, so be advised that your plate fills up quickly.

Why is it so great - FANTASTIC food, amazing selection, chic decor, and of course, bottomless mimosa!   The food here tastes and looks delicate - great presentation and things taste fresh and light. Great variety as you get all kinds of cuisine, American, Italian, Asian, Mexican etc etc. I really have to rave about their dessert, make sure you save room for these because they are what makes this buffet a step above the other Vegas buffets in my opinion. First of all, it's huge, even bigger than Wynn's dessert bar. Second, everything is SO CUTE! Hence making everything look even more appetizing. The dessert come in small portions and the plus side of that is you get to try a variety of their delicious desserts instead of getting full from one big slice of chocolate fudge pie. Nothing is too sweet so you get to enjoy other flavors and textures of their dessert such as the sourness in the mango gelato, fluffiness of coconut puree, and the richness of the chocolate of the chocolate-covered gigantic strawberry.

I know that buffets are the thing in Vegas and throughout the years, I've tried many different buffets and I think I get less and less impressed with Wicked Spoon each year.   Yes, the long lines suck and then you pay and then stand in another long line. The WIFI doesn't work because it's for hotel guests only so you get little to no service while you're waiting in line. Then there's the price, it's $35 for the buffet, but if you want  bottomless  champagne, bloody marys, etc. it's $45.   The issue with that is, it's not bottomless, your waiter doesn't just refill your glass when it's empty, you need to request it and since you're always up standing in lines to get food, you get maybe 3 glasses if you're lucky. Oh and in fine print, they mention that you can only redeem the  bottomless  alcohol for 2 hours from payment. To me, it doesn't make sense, because you're standing in line AGAIN after you pay, so you really have about an hour to redeem your  bottomless  alcoholic drinks.   Then there's the water served at the tables, it's pretty to serve it in a glass bottle but it still tastes like tap water. Just don't lie to us and serve us in regular pitchers, we won't be upset.   And what buffet such as this one doesn't have crab legs or lobsters? I know it doesn't say that it's a seafood buffet, but come on, even the Bellagio carries crab legs and lobsters and it doesn't have the name  Seafood  in its name anywhere. I do like that it has ethnic food options which was pretty cool, overall.   Also, I don't think this buffet is as big as some of the other buffets I've been to, but it's still pretty good nonetheless.
