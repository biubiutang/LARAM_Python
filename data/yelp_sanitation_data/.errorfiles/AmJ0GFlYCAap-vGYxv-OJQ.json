Our regular server always leaves a pitcher of iced tea on the table for my guy, who is an iced tea camel to the highest degree, not because she doesn't have time to be back but because she knows he will down it. I cannot say enough about the service here. It has NEVER been bad.  The owner of the restaurant can often be seen talking with his guests and I have been lucky enough to chat with him for awhile.

This past Saturday, Rocky's Bar &  Grill (abbreviated Rocky's) was the bar and grill where my work week merged into my weekend.     Rocky's is located in the small shopping center at the southeast corner of Maryland Parkway at Windmill Lane. The locally famous Grouchy John's Coffee Shop is the landmark.     For a couple of years I had been parking near Rocky's when I hung out in Grouchy John's. I never stepped inside until this weekend.     In similar style to many bars and grills, Windows here are nonexistent. Once I stepped inside the heavy brown doors, I left the outside world for an isolated world of dining, gambling, and moderate drinking. In similar style to several bars and grills, the layout is a dimly lit restaurant separate from the smoky bar and lounge.     From the time I walked through the doors, I waited a few minutes to be acknowledged. The host and only waiter Roland arrived a few minutes later. He was friendly and professional. He invited me to sit anywhere. I chose a comfortable booth in a room that was sporadically populated and quiet to the degree that it is a nice place for a date or me time. The primary sounds were the hard Rock classics playing at a soft volume.     My mind was set on the chicken parmesan sandwich. When it came time to ordering, Roland let fall that it is a hero style sandwich that doesn't come with fries. Okay. I'd order the fish & chips.     The three large pieces of cod and the steak fries were tastational and filling. The portions were large to the point of Roland placing a second plate containing  bowls of tarter sauce and cole slaw. The cole slaw was out of this World. Rocky gives the knockout punch with the cole slaw. I give Rocky's kudos for including cole slaw with the fish & chips. In my opinion, fish & chips without cole slaw is like nachos without cheese. Yet, it amazes me that there are so many restaurants that just don't get it and exclude cole slaw with fish &  chips. A few restaurants that I lately reviewed that are guilty of this are Village Pub and Red Robin. This delicious cole slaw rounded up my rating from 3.5 to 4 stars. The fish &  chips with bottomless Pepsi came out to $14.47 before tipping Roland.     If I was still hungry, I could of ordered a homemade apple cobbler or vanilla ice cream. Subsequently to the end of the work week dinner, I  headed for the beginning of the weekend revelry in the bar/lounge.     The bar/lounge is a long rectangular space with sofa style chairs and a bar with monitors above showing sports and video gaming below. I played my video Keno while enjoying a $3 PBR and watching the UFC. I shared the bar and lounge with a friendly clientele.     Time went by fast. When I opened the heavy brown door to return to the real World I had a few thoughts lingering on the isolated World of Rocky's. As I put the thoughts to words they are that this is a good spot in the Southeast Valley to enjoy tasty fish & chips that include delicious Cole slaw before a cold one and some moderate gaming or watching a sports event.           I                                                                  I         I        Pictures of the food &  menu       I     \  I  /                                                           \  I  /       \I/                                                               \l/", "Date": "2015-02-09", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "jackson", "ReviewID": "2DsPLsmmQxzMJ5SziWPDsw", "Overall": "1", "Content": "So I decided to give Rockies a second chance after my horrible experience with the bartender with the tattoo I walk in tonight and first thing she made a stupid comment about my yelp review this broad need to get a life you can take your beer and shove it.

The Reuben was good, with more meat than kraut and good Thousand Island dressing, but salty.  Rounded out with raspberry tea and no room for dessert, we left satisfied.

My only complaint is they removed the outstanding beef tips from the dinner menu - this was a signature dish that was always worth the trip, darn tasty.

Chicken wings were good, mozzarella sticks were awesome and the nachos were also very good. It came on a plate big enough to serve a Thanksgiving turkey with a myriad of sauces.  Full bar, lots of beer on tap. Didn't see a wine list or ask for specialty cocktails so can't comment on that.

Rocky's was a Timbers for years and when the ownership changed, the price of their food went down but the ingredients for most of their dishes also became noticeably reduced in quality. The upside is that the portions are pretty big for the price.  (On that note, I was surprised that Joyce was mentioned as giving good service because if she's the Joyce who has served us, we've experienced her disappear for long periods of time and seeing the bartender or another waitress notice us and pick up the slack in her section often.)  But the price is right for solid bar food, friendly bartenders, (mostly) good wait staff and lots of great seats - tables, large booths and a non-bar dining area- to watch sports on their many TV's. The alcohol selection's not huge but they have everything from Miller Lite and Bud to Guinness and Bass on tap. Plus, there are drink specials and once the bartenders get to know you (pretty quickly), they can get you what you need quick enough, whether beer or mixed drinks.  Also, calling Rocky's a gastropub is misleading. It is like other  locals  taverns that give the off-Strip Vegas dining scene its unique character (PT's, Steiner's, Village Pub). It's a good go-to place for inexpensive bar food and a place to watch the game or celebrate St. Patrick's Day with your friends, but neither the food nor the decor is  what most people think of as  gastro.  For that, try Shakespeare's on Eastern Ave. or off-Strip Irish pubs like McMullan's or Molly Malone's.  Overall, don't go to Rocky's expecting amazing food, but the portions are large, you won't spend a lot of money for them and your bartender will treat you right. If you need a place to watch the big game, it's also not a bad place to be.", "Date": "2011-12-16", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Craig", "ReviewID": "DTL5vWo11lmWH8PxJL4-Pg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Had a great time.

Rocky's has decent food at decent prices. The food took quite a while to get to us which was odd because it wasn't busy. It would've been a better experience if the waitress was more attentive. We were there for over an hour and she never once refilled our waters. Overall it's a decent enough place to hang out with friends while grabbing a bite to eat.", "Date": "2014-08-03", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Margie", "ReviewID": "O_Zll5oY8ZLTCJLyzpMcew", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Best bartenders in town!

I stopped by on Sunday with friends to have breakfast, there one and only tv in restaurant was not working (it has been broken for 3 weeks). Customers came in and walked out when they found out it was not working. This is the start of the football season. I asked for the manager but was told he was not there.  Joe you need to get with it, there are plenty of other Bars and Restaurants near by that have  working  TVs.  It seems to me that you have no clue on how to keep your customers happy.", "Date": "2012-09-10", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Richard", "ReviewID": "UGHdC6p9kgMJ-W8cur-Hkg", "Overall": "3", "Content": "So chicken in salad was really good, no really really good.

But it was the closest place to a meeting I was about to have and I was starving, so I went in.   Now, I hesitated to order a turkey burger because I'm a blue blooded American that believes dead cows on a burger bun are a gift from God but it was honestly the best turkey burger I've ever had, hands down. Fries were great too and they make their own ranch dressing on site which is fantastic.   Bartender was friendly. Good selection of beers. He was knowledgeable on them and on the food.   For me, one star detracted for the atmosphere. Smoking is permitted and again - no windows. The place deserves a classier atmosphere than what they're giving it.", "Date": "2016-08-28", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
