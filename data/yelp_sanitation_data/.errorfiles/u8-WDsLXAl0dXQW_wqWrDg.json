I really wasn't in the mood for anything in particular... He was ready to eat his own arm. As we walked through New York New York, we saw  Broadway Burger Bar  and decided to look no further.  I found the menu (somewhat) limited. My husband went with the Cowboy Burger which had bacon, (pepper jack) cheese, onions and BBQ sauce on it. He is lactose intolerant and can't do pepper jack cheese so he asked if he could get provolone instead and the server said there was an up charge for provolone... I personally have NEVER heard of an up charge for a cheese switch, especially provolone???? He then asked for it to be cooked Medium Well and she said they ONLY cook the burgers medium or well... Personally have NEVER heard of only 2 temps either. Weird. Sides do not come with the burgers so you pay extra if you want fries. They do have a combo where you get a burger and add fries and a drink for $5 more (which is what he did). He said the burger was really good but unfortunately having it well done made it dry (but he was nervous getting it med). The fries were great too, fresh cut.  I ended up choosing just a house salad. I asked if I could get romaine lettuce instead of the lettuce it was supposed to come with. There was a looooooooooong pause... And I continued,  Or is that a problem??  Eventually she said I could have romaine. (Almost then asked if there would be an up charge for that switch). The description said the salad came with a  sherry vinaigrette  but I get weird with dressings, they can make or break a salad so I asked for it on the side. It ended up being good BUT I wouldn't call it a vinaigrette... It was a creamy dressing similar in consistency to Caesar or ranch. I see vinaigrette and I think more or a thin Italian-like, oil & vinegar dressing.   Iced tea cost $4. Yikes. Seemed high.  Server was ok. She wasn't super friendly but did her job.   All in all, food was good and came out fast. They'll charge you for everything extra.

It didn't appear to be an overly busy night but about half full.  My only complaint would be that we felt rushed by the waitress.

I cannot recall the name of the burger that I had, but it was your run of the mill hamburger with the fried egg in it. I opted out of the cheese and had some sweet potato fries on the side.   The reason it gets 4 stars is because of the taste, location, value, and service. Unfortunately, the  touristy-ness  takes away a star, and that's not the restaurant's fault. I understand it's part of a big tourist area and how they try really hard to appeal for tourist dollars. The price is very good given the type of food you are ordering and the location of the restaurant.  Finally, the service was good. I remember that the bartender was very friendly, and knew that most of the patrons coming in and out of their restaurant were people who were playing the sports book and/or ponies, like myself.

The Broadway Burger Bar & Grill couldn't have a better location, right in the heart of the New York, New York. And we wanted to try it from the moment we saw the sign. We were disappointed.  We ordered two  Cowboy  burgers and one child's chicken strips meal, all of which proved tasteless. That's a lot of calories and a lot of dollars for not a lot of enjoyment.  Some positives: we were seated immediately, and service was very fast even in the middle of lunch. And the onion rings (with some dipping sauce) were quite nice.  But you don't visit a burger restaurant for onion rings, so let's talk about the burgers. First, Broadway Burger Bar & Grill cooks burgers either  medium  or  well done , so if you like your burger  medium well  you're compromising before you even sit down.  Each burger can be made with beef ( all natural, grass fed, 100% free range Estancia Beef ), chicken, salmon, turkey, or veggie as its heart. And there are more than a few combinations of toppings on the menu. We picked The Cowboy ( Applewood-smoked bacon, barbecue sauce, crisp onions and pepper jack cheese. )  Every word of that sounds delicious. The real things were completely bland. Unseasoned ground beef has more taste at our house than all those wonderful combinations did here. Even with the pepper jack cheese and barbecue sauce, I couldn't find even a hint of spice or flavor in my meal.  With the most basic burger (the  B3&G ) costing $9.95, by the time we'd added drinks and onion rings, a meal for two adults and a small child rang up over $50. That's admittedly less than we might have spent at other casino restaurants, where everything is overpriced, but that doesn't make the product worth the price.  In-and-Out burger is just a ten minute walk down Tropicana, and would be a better experience for about a third the cost. Inside the casino, Nathan's (on the second floor) costs about the same but offers a much tastier meal.", "Date": "2012-03-30", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "LCLLQ28vRBCrh1UhedioKw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Visited twice during my recent Vegas visit, once for lunch, once for dinner, both times ate at the bar and both times service was very good, a little better during the lunch visit.

However, both times i had the garlic and herb fries with my burgers.  This is where they lost a star.  They serve the fries in a metal basket that is shaped like a mini deep fryer basket lined with paper to catch the oil.  However the fries are packed into the basket so the oil is trapped and the fries are soft and mushy.  The first order was tolerable, but the second time was worse.  I'll know better next time.  There are three or four other types of fries and don't know if they result in same mushiness.  There are also many sauces that can be had on the side, though none really appealed to me.

As far as burgers go, I would say, this is as good as your going to get. The portion size per burger is huge, the amount of choices you can get on it are endless, and the taste and quality is perfect. Went here twice (once at the beginning of my trip and once at the end) and both times we enjoyed the place very much. I've had many standard hamburgers, but Broadway Burger in NYNY is far beyond that. I almost wish I stayed longer to try all the burger options.   PROS *Price - For the price it was certainly worth it. With tip, I think I paid around $16 for a really good burger. That may sound expensive, but for Las Vegas I think that is pretty reasonable after everything is said and done.  *Quality & Taste - A lot of fancy restaurants overcharge for a standard hamburger, but this place really brings flavor and juice to its burgers. Not to even mention there are a ton of options to put on your burger and make it how you really want. I got the Cowboy burger and added a fried egg, to give it a ton of extra flavor.  *Portion Size - Burger is huge. You will be full after eating it.  *Atmosphere - It's in NYNY, so when you're eating there, you feel like your actually in a city. It's pretty cool have they have a whole section for restaurants in the area, so when you walk around you'll see a NY Pizza place and so on.  CONS *Caesar Salad and Fries - Really the only negative I saw with this place was the Caesar salad and the fries. The Caesar salad was very dry and not very flavorful. They didn't really have caesar dressing, but just some parmesan cheese. Also, I wasn't the biggest fan of the fries, but to be honest, I've had much worse too.", "Date": "2013-02-16", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Debbie", "ReviewID": "8hzBEq4mdbHDF-hqS2omiA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "David our waiter was amazing!

Eh. Blah.   Before making the long drive back to LA, the 'crew' (i lack a better term) - and I were cranky, hungry and hung over and couldn't agree on a kind of food to consume. When in doubt, grab a burger. So stumbling around New York, New York - we ran into this place.   It was pretty empty so we figured we could get some food relatively quick and hit the road. Too bad that wasn't the case.   The service was ridiculous. It wasn't busy at all and there were plenty of staff around to get to us, but mannnnnnn slow is not descriptive enough. I guess everyone else was hungover too.   Anyway, I was digging the idea of grass fed beef and all that hipster burger-ness that I adore. Too bad it didn't deliver.  My burger was on the dry side (so much for med rare), the bun was a bit day old feeling and the flavors were gamey and over seasoned. Damn it. I hate when I waste calories on bad food.   Also, one of the burger options says 'avocado' whereas another option is 'guacamole' so I assumed that there were two options. Nope - no avocado. Stooopid.  But the guac was fresh - I have to give it to them on that.  (However, that begs the question of whether it was homemade...which means I could have had avocado plain, right? - anyway.)

I do remember paying something like $40 for everything - everything being two burgers, an order or fries, a beer and the aforementioned root beer float.  Sounds about right for a restaurant, ya?  The noise level is pretty average, where we were sitting by the kitchen anyway.  You sort of get used to the singing of slot machines while inside any casino so someone with a sensitivity to noise might think other than me.

The Philly Cheese steak burger was very good, too.  Both were very juicy, needed plenty of extra napkins!!  And if you must have fries with burger (like its optional), go for garlic fries.  They have an interesting way of making them, they use minced garlic!!!  Lots of garlic and one serving was more than enough for two. You can get about 6 differnet mustards and four types of mayo.

The turkey patty was on the salty side but as a whole, the burger was pretty good. The bloody mary was very run of the mill. Nowhere near as much horseradish or kick as I like to have in my bloody marys. Service was attentive and food came out in a timely manner.

I am going to need to revisit Broadway Burger Bar & Grill sober so that I can write an update... I was pretty Jagered up by the time we arrived, and can't even comment on the burger I had (I will spare you all the details, haha!). I wasn't too drunk to notice a few things though!    Likes:  Prices weren't bad, considering it was a casino on the Strip.  There was no wait to be seated at 8 pm on a Saturday night.  Options for turkey and veggie burgers, variety is always a plus.   Dislikes:  I had to ask for water multiple times before I got it. My husband also asked for waters for the table. I was the only one that got a water, after asking again...  And I REALLY needed some water!!! When my husband asked for his burger to be medium well he was told his options were medium or well, nothing else.  Most of the beers that our table requested were not available. Having a decent selection of good beers means nothing if the ones people order are not actually available.   The garlic and herb fries smelled fantastic but I found the flavor to be a little weak. Maybe it was the booze messing with my tastebuds though?? They don't skimp on the amount of fries, consider splitting an order if you aren't a heavy eater. My brother in law RAVED about his burger, he even said it was the best he ever ate. That may have been the whiskey talking though...  My husband devoured his burger as well, and commented that he could really tell the meat was good quality.   Since the guys were so happy with their meals, I would definitely be down to go back sometime...

Our hostess greeted us with a smile and promptly seated us. The waitress followed shortly thereafter and took our orders. I decided to play it safe and just get a cheeseburger($9.95) and fries($2.95), while my friend opted for the chili cheese burger($11.50).   Both of our burgers were quite tasty and the patties were so thick and juicy! They seem to take great pride in the fact that their burgers are 100% free-range, grass fed Estancia beef.  This means they are all natural with no hormones and no antibiotics! Nice! Fries were nothing spectacular, but the portion size was healthy.  We were checked on repeatedly by our waitress and never had to ask for our drinks to be topped off. We were very pleased with the service here.  I noticed some people complained about the prices, but considering you are on the strip, the prices are not bad at all. Actually it's not too much more than you would pay at a Chili's or Applebee's off the strip...so suck it up,cupcake!
