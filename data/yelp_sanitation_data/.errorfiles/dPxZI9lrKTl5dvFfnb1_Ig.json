So I let them to my favorite Italian restaurant. I did a triple take when my beloved Montesanos was not there.  So naturally we wanted Italian food so what a perfect time to try the new local Italian restaurant.  And I'm very happy that we did. We were greeted and seated by one of the owners named Pascal?  We were served by his sister whose Name Escapes Me but who had a lovely personality and attentive service. There were four in our party and we all ordered different dishes. The chicken alfredo , sausage and peppers sandwich , lasagna, followed by hand filled cannoli.  Everyone agreed their food was excellent. I'm so happy that the family-owned restaurant I lost has been replaced by a family-owned restaurant I am certain I will come to love.  It truly feels to me like a newer version of one of my old favorites.  Thank you for a wonderful dining experience, excellent service, and relaxed atmosphere.  Not only will I be back, but I will bring more friends and family!

We want to like this place as the previous Resteraunt was one of our all time favorites. The owners are very nice and helpful I will give them that. They work the dining room well checking on things. We sat at a middle table looking into the wait station. We sat for 10 minutes before we were told who our server would be but I guess they forgot to tell her. Lots of staff in the dining room running around but no one stopped to check on us for the 10 minutes. When we were approached we ordered an appetizer and a glass of wine and for another 10 minutes no wine to the table as everyone kept working the POS computer for orders. We stopped one of the openers who handled the wine delivery. Mozzarella balls were very good and I had the Seafood Pasta which was very good and hot. Wife had the Eggplant park which the outer layer was hot but the interior was ice cold. Not a good fist experience but I hope they will get better and we will try again. They did deduct the eggplant from the final bill which is admirable. What I noticed is that there is an over abundance of staff on the floor but all doing different things at the same tables. The Server who delivered the food kept getting the tables wrong or brining the wrong meal to a table. Again I hope that in time they fall into a rhythm. The table next to us had the same issues with service and order delivery so it was not just us this evening. We did how ever receive a free dessert which was also very good. We will be back and hopefully my next review will be in the 5 star range", "Date": "2016-12-18", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Anthony", "ReviewID": "BScEiSXDtUXjp6VlW5n3QA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Great food I had the Veil Parmesan very tasty.

We were previously pretty dedicated to Montesano's as our regular pizza place and, like apparently a lot of people, desperate to find a suitable replacement -- that it would be located in the exact same space would just be a convenient bonus.   Unfortunately, the search continues. :-/  We did a large half cheese/half pepperoni, it was just over $16 (there's a $1 charge for take out, apparently, which is...fine ¯\_(ツ)_/¯) and it was incredibly mediocre. I think the photo kind of speaks for itself, but it was basically the taste/look of a pizza they'd serve in a high school cafeteria. It definitely is pizza, but it's not really what you wanted.   (It's about the same level of fulfillment as Blaze, just down the street, in my opinion. Definitely not the  new regular spot I was so ardently hoping for.)  The guy that answered the phone was super nice and the staff inside was nice, and it's possible that their actual entrees are where they excel and the pizza is just an afterthought, but for our experience, and what we were looking for them to do, it comes up pretty short.", "Date": "2016-12-24", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Danielle", "ReviewID": "PsWjBaIMe9zC0kd2jt2RuA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Much love to Pasquale and Dion, not only was the food amazing!!  but its so nice to have that extra personal touch where your treated like family.

I used the GrubHub app for delivery. Lasagna , Meatballs and a Fettuccine pasta with cherry tomatoes and olive oil. Very easy process to order thru the app. Food arrived as promised on time. The problems as I see them are this. Carry out package is simple foil tins with paper tops. Really not designed to keep food warm and leak free. The Grubhub folks use the standard insulated bags for transport. The time to get to my house from the restaurant is literally 15 minutes tops. Well the food had to be reheated and the lasagna leaked thru the top lid. So many new modern to- go type containers are available that are microwave friendly. I recommend that they use this type. Sure they cost a bit more but add on the price for carry out. They already do. The food my guess wasnt that hot when the delivery guy showed up to get the order. Quality was average. I prefer Buon Gusto or Bootlegger.

We never got bread when every table around us did. When the meal came I realized I was not getting my soup :(  The food was good but it was not very hot. We then ordered coffee and that was not hot. We did receive a comped desert of cookies and mini cannoli's. The table agreed that was the best part of this experience.   When my husband received the check the server told us that she said she was sorry once already. She then took $9.00 off the check.   All my husband's customers had good things to say.
