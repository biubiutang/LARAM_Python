I am so glad I did! The cocktails were all wonderful! The mixologist there was so friendly and accommodating. And the atmosphere was just delightful. Calm, quiet, I just wish we had gone on a pianist night. The history of the place is cool. Be sure to obey the rules - that's what makes this place as special as it is!!

I came across  The Laundry Room  which is located in the  Commonwealth  bar. Just like you, I was on Yelp and was only able to find out that I needed to text a number to make a reservation. At first I wasn't able to find this so called number and almost gave up. Then I did as much research as I could find on  The Laundry Room  and was able to get the number. We went on a Sun night at 9:30 and the Commonwealth bar was pretty dead even though it was a cool little spot. We texted the number again to let them know we were there and were led into a small room hidden by a secret door. The mixologist June was amazing!! We sat at the bar and talked to her the whole time. She is definitely a mixologist and not a bartender, her drinks take time to make so don't rush her. I can't remember the decor too much except I know they had doors on the ceiling and in the bathroom they had a old school Alcohol Still from the prohibition days and old newspaper clippings as wall paper. They also had the best popcorn in a goblet style type cup and you could eat as much as you wanted. It wasn't regular popcorn either, it was like a sweet and spicy flavored popcorn. There was like a 2 hour time limit but June and her bar-back/helper (who was also really chill and nice) said we could stay as long as we want. The drinks were absolutely delicious and super strong. I had 4 drinks in 3 hours and left feeling pretty good. I will definitely come back every-time I go to Vegas. No need to text the number next time cause June gave us her card and said we could personally call her to let her know we were coming in. I thought that was pretty cool of her and it made our stay at the infamous  Laundry Room  a little more special then others.", "Date": "2013-03-29", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Alexis", "ReviewID": "D2Pjn228pJKo_2I_22oqzg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...  Don't tell anyone about this place!  It is quite the little jewel.  It's hidden inside of Commonwealth, but SHHHHHHH don't tell anyone!  You have to text a number to get a reservation and then when you get to Commonwealth, you look around like you're lost and then someone says,  Excuse me, do you have a reservation at Laundry Room?   Why, yes we do, how do we get in?   Follow me....  through a door hidden in the wallpaper, and then another door, and then.....boom!!! You're in the 1920s.  I mean as soon as you walk in there is some prohibition clinkity piano music going on, some filligree on the wallpaper, some tufted couches, and a glorious bar with very comfortable backless stools (usually not a fan of backless stools, but these were nice).  Drinks are labor intensive, delicious, rightfully expensive (so don't complain, you've been warned!), and full of a bunch of ingredients that I've never heard of, but damn are they amazing.  There is also popcorn in little vintage bowls strewn with crystals.  Now listen....I don't like popcorn.  I don't like how it gets stuck in your teeth and tastes stale no matter what.  But this popcorn was HATCH CHILE popcorn and it was spicy, a little smoky, and I pretty much became obsessed with it considering the bartender filled the bowl up twice for me.  This is what a speakeasy should be.  Classy, sexy, chic, and mysterious.  SHHH, DON'T TELL ANYONE!  PS, I would have taken some pictures, but pictures are not allowed!!

My story starts with a date night with the wife.  We do not usually frequent bars as a couple, not our scene, but I was able to secure an elusive reservation on a Friday night and my wife and I decided to partake after dinner.  We arrive at the Commonwealth and skip the line by telling the doorman we are on the Laundry Room list.  Show the text and was let in.  Once in, texted again and was asked to wait at the end of the bar.  A wonderful young lady named Kara, steps though a small door in the back and leads us to the back room.  We are now in a small parlour with about 15 people, a bar and a piano.  We sit in the back of this charming room and was personally served by the bartender, Dan I believe was his name.  He asked what we liked, told him what my wife likes and I got my customary Moscow Mule.  My wifes concoction was like a passionfruit creamsicle.  Delicisous.  My MM was also great, tangy with a little bit of spice.  The whole experience is what people love about the LR.  It's exclusive, you are in a nice area to talk with your companions, not noisy and loud like the full bar that is 10 feet away from you.

So we made a reservation for my wife's Bday and 3 of our 4 guests were there when we checked in. Our fourth was about a min out and Harrah informed us to wait where we were and that she would come back and seat us as soon as our other member arrived. A couple minutes later we were all there and we stood waiting for her to return. After 5mins passed we asked the bartender and he informed us to just hang tight and she should be out shortly. 5 more mins passed so we decided to text her again. No response for another 5 mins and then she comes out to seat another group, afterwards she doesn't return, only texts us that we missed our time and that she wouldn't seat us. I asked for clarification and to speak with her and 15 mins later she finally comes out, talks to some other guests and then eventually come over to our party who has been standing in the same spot for almost 30mins. Her explanation was that they have tables available but that she wouldn't seat us because we missed our reservation! I asked if there was anything she could do since it was my wife's Bday and her response was,  that's not my problem.  To make matters worse when we asked the bartender to validate that we had all been on time and waiting on her, she just walked off. The bartender was empathetic but confirmed our suspicion that the real issue here is that Harrah has a power complex and is one of those people who likes to turn down customers to make herself feel special. What she doesn't understand is there are tons of bars in town with signature cocktails and that mixology isn't a limited art in Vegas. If you want a good speakeasy skip this place and go to the  velveteen rabbit instead.

The laundry room used to be for the Cortez across the street in the 1940s.  To gain entry you will need to text their number and then follow the instructions provided.  Once inside commonwealth just wait for someone to grab you and they will show you the way into the laundry room.  It's a small hidden bar that can maybe seat about 20 people max? So reservations are critical here! All drinks go for $15 each and you can also order popcorn too! (Have to try it! It's delicious!)   As for the drinks the menu provides plenty of excellent options, and the best part is you can even order off the menu too! The mixologist Tony did an incredible job crafting our drinks to his perfection.  I went with the sazerac which I was told may be the best sazerac and that I won't be able to drink it anywhere else! After hearing such a bold statement I had to try it out! The result? It is definitely up there, and will get you feeling pretty good if you're looking for a drink with a strong kick.

Getting into a speak easy is always fun and even more fun when you're visiting Vegas for your birthday. Its true what they say, if you don't have a cell phone you can't get in. There is a secret phone number that my boyfriend found on his own in less than a minute. Its not hard people, you just need to be observant.   The interior of The Laundry Room is bad ass. Every teeny tiny detail is completely well thought out. Even the long stick candles were real and lit. There are rules when you visit a speak easy and this one is no different. I abided and didn't snag any photos. My boyfriend on the other hand snagged photos and cussed occasionally. Sorry 'bout it! (Thats what he would say)  For $15 cocktails its a good thing they are strong right? you feel like you're getting your monies worth. My experience wasn't that. My drink was so strong I could barely finish it let alone enjoy it. And believe me, I can handle my liquor. Everyone else with me enjoyed their beverages just fine. That is one reason I didn't give this place five stars. The main reason though? I'll get there. First and foremost you should know that I NEVER rate or review a business based off of other people visiting the establishment.  Although, when a speak easy has rules I expect them to live up to that standard and a few of their top rules were, 1- Regarding Guests. Do not bring anyone in here you would not allow into your home to babysit your only child and/or your new born puppy. 2- Please, Speak Easy. Keep the volume of your voice at a reasonable level. And 3- Jesters Who Muse.  The patrons may be minimally tolerated, but jesters lacking redeeming social value will be escorted out.   A group next to us was clearly friends of the bar tender and possibly owners of the establishment. After us waiting almost two hours to get in, they were enjoying themselves by being annoyingly loud and a girl at the table literally kept looking at our table with the craziest  I will destroy your face  expression. On one occasion we all stared back and she didn't look away. It was beyond creepy and awkward. This woman and her friend had been escorted out of Common Wealth earlier that night. If she's getting kicked out of Common Wealth, how is she even allowed into  The Laundry Room ? Guess the rules are for show. Which is fine. Towards the end of our stay I over heard the group of people saying things such as  lets get these people out of here  etc... I get it, you're all friends and you want to enjoy this place alone.

The bartender is really nice and he'll make a specific drink from the menu or you can ask him to make you something special. I forgot the name of the drink I ordered but it tasted like nail polish ..... BLEH! :( I couldn't even finish it because it was just not sitting well with me. They also gave me some rose petals to put in my drink but it didn't make it any better. Yikes!!   We only stayed for about 30 mins and left. They also give you a clothespin with their  laundry room  logo on it as a souvenir or something? Or it's your ticket back in if you ever want to go back. You also couldn't take pictures inside so that was kinda sad for me since I wanted to take pictures for memory. But the bathroom was nice! They had a cool faucet and it was really clean.   But I probably won't come back here the next time I'm in vegas since it wasn't really my type of scene.", "Date": "2014-06-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ashley", "ReviewID": "hdiHc8xhdkNe82uW_Q5Y4A", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I absolutely LOVED this place.

Come in with an open mind and a taste for creativity. I recommend the Sazerac if you enjoy rye whiskey and also asking the bartender to make you something customized.

All drinks are 15 dollars which is a perfect price for the cocktail and the service you get. It sits up to 27 people so it's not a big place so it makes it more private.

I can't even begin to describe our experience! I had heard of The Laundry Room recently and wanted to check it out, especially if it's anything like Commonwealth + Park-- and obviously, it is part of the trendy, hip experience! The only downside of that is making a trip downtown when it's NOT super packed at these popular spots. It ruins the experience haha. So Sunday night, after watching War Horse.... And to my surprise, they were open and operating! WOOOO HOOOOO!!!!! Texted the # on here and they responded right away, I got a rezo!   It was all of our first time, party of 3 speakeasy lovin girlfriends! Didn't realize this is THEE only speakeasy in Vegas! And they do everything right by having the secret entrance and being exclusive. We were greeted by Kara, the host... She was a lovely gal! Brought us in through a couple doors and explained the concept. She showed us to our table and we had gourmet popcorn waiting for us! Chili con Queso from POPPED! Mmmm we killed that right away haha she also brought us water in a cute bottle that stayed with us all night. Dan was our server/mixologist and he was WONDERFUL! Definitely had the persona for the job-- I wish I would've met this Ju everyone raves about though! Dan made some great suggestions and drinks for us, one of my girlfriend's drinks were prettttyy strong haha we even told him to maybe not make her such a strong drink the 2nd round and it was still pretty strong haha. He must have really liked her ;)  The decor an ambience was SUPERB!!!! Totally brought us back to our ideal era-- the roaring 20s! We chose the theme of 1926 for the evening! The music was fitting, the chandelier looked like a timeless antique, the table clothes looked aged but gorgeous, they had cute linens as bev naps, the popcorn was served in fancy large oversized ashtrays haha, it was dim in the lounge, totally intimate. Everything was just PERFECT!!!!!  Prices aren't even bad, average of $12/drink. I'd pay more for the experience and everything!!!! I decided I want to host a themed bday/Christmas party in there! Very exclusive and limited of course-- I'm talking BUYOUT!! Who's in?!! Thank you, Commonwealth for blowing my mind again! Y'all rock!!!!

Laundry Room is Commonwealth's not so secret secret room. Theres a some what hidden door to get in and out but someone has to let you in and out. Getting in is pretty much the only thing you need to figure out cause I dont remember and wanted to get in last time there. Just remembered a little close pin. Try asking the Commonwealth bartenders.  The cocktails are $15 a pop but they'll cater to you, bring snacks, water, chill with you while get sober or wasted and relax. The bartender was awesome friendly and made some perfect drinks. The hostess was very friendly I gave her a big hug before I left.  Its literally a small room with just enough room for a full bar and a couple small tables w/ chairs. Theres a door that goes to the street, im sure its just for emergencies.

On previous trips to town, we'd tried to get reservations for the intimate speakeasy within Commonwealth without success.  However, whether it was the day (Sunday) or the hour (around 9:30pm), we were able to get seats at a small table in the cozy room.  The cocktail menu was impressive in its comprehensiveness and detail, covering a wide swath of differing spirits and taste profiles.  While the extensive list may have made it difficult to make a decision, Dan the seriously talented bartender, made it easy by coming over to our table and discussing the menu with us.  He asked questions and made sage recommendations to customize cocktails on the list to precisely fit our particular tastes.  It was akin to the chef coming out of the kitchen to go over the menu.  Frankly, it was the kind of service touch that made a serious impression.  Our classic cocktails were impeccably made, nicely balanced, and exactly what I'd hoped they would be.  The wife's Boulevardier with a slight twist was genius.  The Laundry Room is a must for anyone who loves a well-made drink.  Is it a bit pretentious?  Sure, but that probably helps it to maintain its exacting standards and keep the customer experience unique and memorable.

I thought thrill of going to a secret bar/speakeasy would be too stuffy and uptight, but it was quite the opposite. It is small, but I love the intimate feel! The mixologist was super cool (I hate that I forgot his name) and made me a special champagne based drink since I don't drink hard liquor.  The drinks are $15 a pop, but worth it for the privacy and experience.  Unfortunately, that night they didn't have a pianist playing (which I didn't know otherwise I would have gone on one of the entertainment nights) but we still had a great time. They even serve you complimentary flavored popcorn.  My favorite aspect was the BATHROOM!! So clever, so be sure to check it out! The theme of the decor and staff went well with the speakeasy theme and you really felt comfortable and at ease there.

Anyhow, we showed up, the reservation allowed us to skip the huge line into Common Wealth on a First Friday. Once in, we were escorted to the oh so mysterious Laundry Room.  Now for the good part. Inside was a fancy dim lit bar and was the brightest area of the room. The bar had drinks not common to ordinary bars. No beer at all. It was quite (as per a rule) and everyone was sat (as per another rule.) At one point someone broke the noise rule and the bar tender shut them up immediately. The bar had seating, there was also seats along the walls. Then a piano and in front of the piano a seating area, which if you are lucky to grab a seat, is the best place. The whole place was lit by very dim light bulbs and some candles, my eyes took a bit to adjust.    After seating, you receive a booklet outlining their specialty drinks although you can ask the bar tender for others. However, if you don't know your alcohol then you will have a hard time choosing one. You have to be patient to order drinks. Why? because the bartender personally visits you and I'll tell you now, she know her sh*t. Very informative and creative. She takes your order and watch her work ever so skillfully!

Texting the host back and forth to literally get the in on this place makes you feel like a member of a secret society, though the entire process is not as intimidating as it might sound. Final reservations are taken at 1a and for groups of up to six, with management reserving the right to limit your seating time to allow for another reservation on especially busy nights. Once you get into Commonwealth, the mixologists will instruct you to just let the host know - via text as well -  that you are here, after which someone will come and shimmy you into what literally used to be the laundry room of the old El Cortez Hotel.   We went on a Wednesday night when we still had a choice of bar or booth (the maximum capacity is 25), so we chose to sit at the bar where Ju was working her magic. She serves each guest that walks through her door, without the help of a cocktail server or a barback, and helps every individual either pinpoint the perfect cocktail on her menu or whips up something she'll feel is perfect for him/her after a bit of conversation. She's currently working on getting some equally fancy non-alcoholic beverages on the list as well so that people who don't understand what a hangover is can participate too.
