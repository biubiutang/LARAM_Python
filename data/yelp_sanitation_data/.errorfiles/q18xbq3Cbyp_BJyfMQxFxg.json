It's humongous and it's four stories. It's M&M's in all its glory. Besides selling every color of M&M imaginable, they also sell clothing, pillows, souvenirs, blankets, and toys. Every so often, they have designs that are current with the times. Since Star Wars is coming back this year in a big way, a lot of merchandise was Star Wars themed. They called it The Chocolate mPIRE.  I bought a few Star Wars M&M shirts for my son and his bestie. They were also running a promotion, so I got the matching blanket for $5. I picked up some magnets and of course my green M&M jacket. I love the green M&M. She's sassy and she's hot.  On the third level, you can catch the short 3D movie. The 3D movie was awesome. It was about 15 minutes long and it looked like things were just jumping out of the screen. The fourth level is all their racing stuff. They have a full sized race car in the middle of the room.", "Date": "2015-10-18", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Daniel", "ReviewID": "Cubl5AtHVdm14ypMb0-tlw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Cool spot but I guess u can't let the chocolate melt.

You can take a picture with the green M & M, fill up on various different flavors, and even pick up keychains if you're a collector!   Visiting this place as a child, it was definitely one of the most vivid memories I've had in regards to Vegas besides picking up an advertisement for strippers at the age of nine. So if you have kids, or are just feeling nostalgic in regards to candy, this is a MUST on your list of tourist attractions while in the area.", "Date": "2015-03-04", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Tiffany", "ReviewID": "5V5EIuCehm9RAVUdGr76nw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Cute store!

Sugar high that is. Sometimes I seriously wonder if the creators of M&M's were on acid or shrooms when they came up with the idea. Chocolate, in a convenient candy coating that comes in MILLIONS OF COLORS. Seems pretty hard to come up with that in your normal state of mind.  I haven't seen it in years, but back when I was a kid and was practically whining for my mom or aunt  to take me out to some sort of amusement park when they didn't have enough money for one they would take me here, buy me bags of M&M's and take me to a ~FREE screening of I Left My M In Vegas in 3-D M&M's are cheap and they come in wide varieties here, the movie is free, there's absolutely no reason to NOT come here.   I love how it's next to the Coca-Cola experience.

I really wanted to give this huge candy store 4 stars, but because of the ridiculous prices they had were outrageous I had no choice but to bring this place down a star.   They don't only have a shizz load of candy, they also sell a bunch of souvenirs, shirts, magnets, cups etc. just about anything you can find at a convenient store but with a m&m label on it. One thing that I really did like at this place though, was their cool little free m&m 3D show. There's 4 floors of everything overpriced m&m stuff (well who cares as these tourists will pay for just about anything). Heck m&ms here tastes just as good as the m&ms down the street at a liquor store, but you're paying more because of how cool this places look. Don't get me wrong this place is cool especially if you love m&ms because this place will make you feel like heaven. I do come here almost every time I'm in Vegas but I hardly buy anything here besides m&ms and watch their show.", "Date": "2011-07-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Luke", "ReviewID": "UBKeY3UIhTHabDAG-1k6mQ", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Sure M&M's World is somewhat similar to their next-door neighbor Everything Coca-Cola - souvenir shops intended to make people to spend money on their merchandise, but at least Everything Coca-Cola has one unique option - the Tastes of the World (sample various cokes from different parts of the world). M&M's World is just an nicely decorated four-story tall building with all souvenirs and nothing interesting to remember.  ***  1st Floor: Souvenirs & gifts, personalized gifts, jewelry & accessories  2nd Floor: M&M's candy wall, M&M's dispensers, apparel, accessories  3rd Floor: Drinkware, home accessories, toys & games, stationary & offices, M&M's personalized printer  4th Floor: NASCAR race car, holiday shop, apparel  ***  There's also a free 10-minute 3D movie showing on the 3rd floor and half pound of candies is $6.99 (you get $5 off if you purchase 1 lb or more of M&M's from the candy wall).

I really enjoyed the store but it was kind of messy inside and on the different floors. Also the escalators were not working and I walked up and down them in the store. I did not mind but it would tiring after the 3rd set. The store is filled with everything m&m which was so cute. I knocked off a star for it being messy inside and the lines were kind of long.

It's colorful, choclatey, and cute. Very family friendly.   There are 4 floors neatly categorized with a variety of items. I've been here twice now in the last 4 years and within that time gap, I saw most of the same items from years ago. So their selection of items don't or rarely ever change.  this can be good or bad. Good because you don't have to worry about low stock of items. Bad because well, there's not much to look forward to if the items are always the same if you visit more than once.   I really recommend the 3D movie too. It's cute and free. It was like 15 minutes long I think?  There is staff that will call out when seats are available and you just walk in.   They have everything here from cute house wares such as mugs, cooking utensils, etc. to jewelry, plushies, coin purses, golf balls, key chains, penny pushers, clothes for kids and adults,   And ofcourse chocolate M&Ms!!! A huge wall of dispensers. $6.99 per half pound LOOOOL. whatever. It's just for fun I guess so why not just try it once. Many flavors, colors, and sizes you won't see on the normal market often.   There are also printers to make custom sayings on the M&Ms, more expensive but a nice gift idea.  Then there's M&Ms prepacked in pretty containers that are glass bottles, have shapes or designs on it , and can be reused for storing stuff. Those are worth the price because of the cute container and price per ounce of candy.   Overall, this is a must stop for all candy lovers. Very colorful and cute. Lots of cute props for sight seeing.  It's located on the strip and you can't miss it when walking around because of the huge M&M statues!", "Date": "2016-03-16", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Francine", "ReviewID": "6uEovY1AjTt52nxOxF64xA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Every child's heaven!  a bit pricey but worth it.

This place is truly unique, different and amazing! This store is located right on the strip so if you are on the strip feel free to take a look, you can thank me later.  It's huge in here! 4 floors full of M&M treats and sweets from candy all the way to pajamas and blankets!  1st floor: Souvenirs and gifts! You can buy cups, blankets, different bags of candy. You name it and they have it! They also have Jewelry that you can buy as gifts and personalize with names! How cool is that?  2nd floor: Whatever you do you HAVE to go to the 2nd floor this is where you will find the M&M wall and boy it's a sight to see! Tons of different M&MS (Peanut butter, Dark chocolate, all different colors) OMG! I wanted to buy the whole wall and place it in my house! HAHA 3rd Floor: They have all type of kitchenware and drink ware with the M&M Symbol on it! I was SO tempted to buy gifts for everyone back at home and bring it back! OMG!  They also have the personalized printer on this floor as well! SWEEETTTT!!  4th Floor: Come do your holiday shopping as well as see the Race car on this floor! Unfortunately I didn't make it all the way to this floor because the 2nd and 3rd floor took nearly 2 hours just to get to everything I wanted to see!   (Yes, expect to stay a couple minutes to hours in here, it's THAT good)  Okay...okay...So the pricing here is CRAZYY!! But what do you expect from a BIG M&M Store like this...You're crazy if you think it's going to be cheap. So let me break it down for you: ~A 1\2 pound is $6.99 ~1 pound of M&M'S- $13.98  Whoa! I need to just stick to the small bag and hurry and run out so I don't get mesmerized thinking about all the M&M'S I could have! HAHA  During the time I came here they had a deal, with any purchase you get the M&M blanket for $5! Of course, I bought it! I had to be able to take something home to say I went to the M&M World Store! Always ask them about the today deals!   This is a definitely MUST see when in Las Vegas and on the Strip!
