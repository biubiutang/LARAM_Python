I have been wanting to try this place for a year and a half.  But between nursing school and work and kids and dogs and training....I have no time!  lol  Today, I had to go down to my doc and get my yearly check up and TB test for healthcare and it just so happens that I would be in the neighborhood...YEAH!!  First, I love Olivier!  He is such a sweet and kind hearted person!  He first asks if you have been there before and then he asks your name.  I noticed after that that everyone that came through the door was addressed by their first name.  This place must really have a following!   I really only wanted to try the quiche...I have been craving quiche for days!  But when he asked if I wanted a cup of coffee I could not resist.  I ordered a latte and wanted a flavor.  Low and behold they have almond.  I asked for not too sweet, just a touch of flavor and my request was perfectly delivered.  The quiche was soooo yummy!  I returned a few days later to have another coffee and croissant.     I love this place and wish it was not so far...but I will make it a point to return anytime I am in this part of town during the right time of day and day of the week!!", "Date": "2013-08-14", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Erika", "ReviewID": "iAYLWW55dI7SfNgtdZ7VVg", "Overall": "1", "Content": "I wanted to like this place so bad, based on all of the good reviews it received on yelp and a bunch of recommendations I kept getting from my friends. Unfortunately, I just did not have the same experience they had.  At first, everything seemed okay. I was greeted by Oliver, who was very welcoming. I ordered a sandwich (I don't remember the name), a cup of thai curry soup, a chocolate pastry, and a water cup. I expected to wait anywhere between 15-25 minutes considering how busy it was at the time. I waited a whole hour for my food to finally get to my table. That's right, one whole hour. For just one sandwich, a cup of soup, a pastry, and a water cup. That's it.   On top of waiting for about an hour, I saw other customers come in after me and receive their food before me. I went up and asked how much longer for my food because it's been about an hour and one of the workers told me it was coming right up. I saw my receipt, so I know my food was not given to the wrong people/forgotten/skipped. I finally got my food, and it was good, but not worth an hour wait, especially when you notice from people that came in after you were already half way through their meals.   I wanted to speak to someone, and finally one of the workers asked me how my food was. I told her it was good, except for the amount of time I had to wait. I was glad to finally talk to someone who seemed to care about my misfortune, but whoops! Nevermind! Before I even got to elaborate or explain how long I was waiting and how others got their food in a fraction of the time, she was already running back towards to kitchen saying  sorry for the wait.  Seriously? If you're going to ask someone about their experience, at least act like you care enough to listen to the whole thing.  Maybe I just came in on a bad day, but regardless, the service should be consistent. I would have appreciated someone taking the time to listen to me, or checking up on me while noticing I was waiting for awhile. Maybe that would give me a reason to come back, but since none of that happened, I don't know how I could ever want to come back.", "Date": "2013-06-14", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Misti", "ReviewID": "bJ5G94dLpqGGGyDvz5D55g", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Soup, sandwiches, quiche and ginger!

It's located along big business that you wouldn't even know it was there until you were told about it. I was seriously rooting for this restaurant since a lot of people has said so many good things about it. After sitting on my archived bookmarks for a while, I finally decided to give this restaurant a go.   Right when me and my friend walked in, we were greeted by a man who asked whether we've visited there before. Did we really look that lost? I think so. He was so pleasant about everything and explained the menu to and gave us a general idea of which one was the most popular items. You can tell that he was an experts about all the food in the menu because I was sold! I wanted to try the croissant with egg as I saw that it's one of the popular items that people review about. My friend got a turkey sandwich.   What I love about this place is that they make their pastries and bread right at their shop so you know that you're eating fresh as always. I love that! It's not everyday that you hear someone say  hey, that bread you're eating was made here on this day.  Now to the taste test. In terms of croissants, I've hard better buttery croissants, but this was the flakiest one! I'm not saying that it's a bad croissant because I want to say that it's up there. I enjoyed how they mixed their own delicious sauce with the croissant along with eggs and mushroom. All together, the ingredients compliment the whole meal.   I also got an organic chai tea latte, which I know I'll be coming back for. It's just so delicious to the taste, and a hint of sweetness. I love how foamy is it on the top as well.

It is true-The owner Olivier takes his time to explain menu items if you have any questions.  I could feel that he loves being there.  We had the special of the day: The pork loin sandwich - tender slices of pork with a creamy sweet sauce, mushrooms, shaved parmesan, baby spinach and tomato on an extremely well made baguette (crispy crunchy exterior texture, soft interior).  Absolutely delectable.  The chocolate tart and pear tart were very delicious as well.  I'd like to come back to sample the quiche (they ran out) and the rest of the menu :-D.

Olivier charmed my friend into trying the Moroccan baguette (which I will have to try next time), and she also fell in love with how well-made the sandwich was.

The location may seem like a scavenger hunt... if you're coming from Rainbow Blvd., making a right onto W. Sunset Rd., you'll drive up and when you see tall office buildings and shiny reflective windows, you'll know you're almost there.. make a left as soon as you see an entry to go in... stay on the left side of the whole complex and when you see the office building number 8337, it's behind that building and you'll be making a slight right passing it. Baguette Cafe will be next to Bank of America. Hope these directions help in your hunt if you decide to give this cafe a try.  I walked in and was greeted right away with a friendly, sweet smile from a gentleman named Olivier. He asked me my name and if I worked in one of the offices nearby and I told him no, but that I stopped by because I wanted to try this cafe. He was happy that I came here and started to passionately talk about what's the specials are today and specifically told me each ingredient that were in those dishes. He was very informative as if he knew everything by heart to the very last seasoning. I love it when you can tell when someone has the  fire  for flavor and food... He enjoyed telling me everything as if he was sharing his favorite recipe with me. All this, while I don't have any makeup on... I know scary right??!?!? It's not even Halloween yet!! Yikes! And he still treated me as if I was his #1 guest.   I ended up trying the Prosciutto Baguette which consist of: mixed greens, tomato, prosciutto, salami, blue cheese, walnut, and celery spread. My sandwich and a handful portion of mixed green salad that had a tangy dressing on top of it was plated on a rectangular white glass dish. Olivier brought me some utensils and hope I enjoy my meal.   From the first look at this Baguette.. I was afraid the bread would be tougher than leather to chew and harder than rock to break glass.. BUT it wasn't at all the case. It was tough on the outside, since most baguette are made that way and soft in the inside... almost spongy. The bread was good, but I was chewing way more than I ever did when eating a sandwich. I actually woke up the next day with a slight sore jaw, but I remember Olivier mentioning that I can order it Panini- style instead of Baguette. There wasn't anything wrong with the Baguette, as a matter of fact the whole sandwich was satisfying and all the ingredients complimented each other. The celery spread tasted light and fresh with a touch of tartness... it kept me guessing what's in it, but it was a delicious spread that softened the saltiness of the freshly cut prosciutto. The walnuts even made it mellow, in a sense giving it a smooth flavor. The blue cheese wasn't so profound, but you can taste it was there. Overall, I did enjoyed this meal. I washed my palate down with some Green Tea Pomegranate Iced Tea that they served there. It was the bitter kind without having any sugar, but I like it sometimes like that.   I bought two muffins on my way out: the Pumpkin and Strawberry. I recall Olivier bringing out a fresh batch of muffins when I first walked in the cafe... they ran out of the Banana Nut Muffin, which I wanted to try, but the Pumpkin Muffin was out of this world delicious! I originally was only going to one bite and start my errands, but it so happens that before I knew it... I did my own magical act and the Pumpkin Muffin disappeared in thin air into my tummy. I know I didn't know I had such talent, but I was still in disbelief that I ate it all in a few seconds. Poof!! Abbra Cudabbra give me another Pumpkin muffin!! :( Sadly I couldn't make it happen and my muffin bag was still empty... darn. I saved the Strawberry Muffin for my date and he asked me if it was still good?!??! Ooo I wanted to hit him upside his head, but no no I'm not a violent person so I told him.. of course it's still good, they made it today!!! What?!? Is he crazy to think I'm going to give him a rotten, spoiled muffin??! Come on! He later told me he ate it for breakfast the next day and it was good.   This cafe isn't a fast food order and BAM it comes out in a flash... no siree bob... they make it after you order and use the freshest ingredients. If you have time to relax, then you'll enjoy this place... but if you want something quick... maybe a salad or muffin doesn't take that long... they have a good selection of salads if that's something you are looking for. Fraps, hot chocolate, smoothies too! They have outside seating as well and bring out the food for you when it's ready. They even play catchy, fun even romantic french music.. nice listening pleasure while you grab a bite to eat or wanting to relax over some tea or coffee.

Olivier and his staff produce some of the most delicious, yet simple, food you can get in Las Vegas. They do what they do well. I've been frequently ordering the blue brie sandwich with chicken, and my husband prefers the curry chicken sandwich. When you get it to go, it doesn't come with the light salad you get when you dine in, but the sandwich stays crispy and warm due to how they wrap it. Today I felt very sick and my husband picked me up their vegetable medley soup, which really gave me a much needed pick me up. Of course, if it's available, I cannot walk away from here without getting their fruit or chocolate tarts. Their chocolate twist is a great alternative if you're just looking for a pastry as well. I wish more office parks had restaurants witch such amazing food and ambiance!

Both were awesome.    I rarely find a place I like this much so this was a treat.  this is definitely a new favorite.  After talking with Olivier (I hope I got his name right) I found out that their Dough is imported from France.  Very nice with an excellent price.  Stopped by later on to get some of that Quiche and some Apple Tart.  The Quiche was excellent and I'll be having sweet dreams of that Tart.  Got the last Croissant of the day, lucky.

To my misfortune, they ran out of soup when I got there (around 3 in the afternoon). Soup is my favorite, but I do like me some paninis! A friend and I ordered the 3-cheese panini and the eggplant panini. Both were very delicious and full of flavor! The bread was the ideal texture. I also distinctly identified the pesto within the sandwich and found it to be very savory! Mmm! They were both such great sandwiches and they both came with a little serving of mixed greens. I have no idea what the dressing was, but that was scrumptious, too, and very light!  On a side note, I think a common complaint people have with  eating healthy , fresh, or light meals like these is that they don't  feel full  afterward. But this definitely had me stuffed in the best way possible! To go with my panini, I had myself a hot chai and it was perfect right down to a tea (tee)! Lol. Never mind the awkward pun... The modern decor is white and bright! The daylight comes in through the windows so beautifully! The simplicity of the decor also brings attention to the lovely photos on the walls!  Lastly, the service was awesome! Everyone here talks of Olivier so kindly and it is definitely true how personable he is to his customers. As someone who likes to experiment with different diets (pescetarianism, vegetarianism, veganism), when he mentioned vegetarian options, I was definitely over the moon. He noticed that and didn't hesitate to ask about it. Who doesn't like genuine, friendly service?!  I'd truly recommend this place to everyone I know, but a significant part of me really just wants to keep it all to myself. LOL...  You won't regret coming to Baguette Cafe!  (p.s.
