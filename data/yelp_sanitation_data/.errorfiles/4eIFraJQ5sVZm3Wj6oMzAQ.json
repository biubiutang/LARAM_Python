It's a fun chill spot to hangout at, BB-8 drink was soooo good like candy to me, Deadpool drink was also pretty good! We will all definitely be back! The owner is very nice also, only thing we didn't not like was that the bartender kept closing our tabs after we ordered every single time...

I was super skeptical of this place when we got invited to our friends birthday party here. I wanted to love former Lady Silvia...but it just never happen. It was stuffy, quiet, and kinda snobby.  MF......totally different. Everyone is welcome and everyone fits in. I thought I would NEVER EVER say this about a  bar  in Vegas but I am.  Growing up, my father is a total Star Trek fan. I guess I inherited it. I own all the original series books first run and most of the other series books. I have read them all many times. Fast forward a few light years and the flame is still burning.  We were welcomed by the super nice bartender which come to find out I know him/met him from way back in 2009. Wow. I caught up with him and we laughed about the crazy days back at where he used to bartend.  Anyway everyone in our party was taken care of with high standards and Alex the owner is super nice. He complimented me about my looks and how I remind him of the Bronte sisters books...then I explained to him they are my favorite authors...odd, maybe, but then again maybe Destiny...  Maybe this place just holds a special place in my heart, but it seemed like everyone around us...felt just at as home as we did.

My boyfriend and I went last night because we saw they were having a Star Wars evening and figured everyone there would have seen the film...we were wrong about that, but it was okay! Our planned hour long stay turned into 4 hours after the owner (who may be the most delightful person I have ever met) set us up with the 3 other folks in the bar who had seen the film.   The atmosphere is more like going to someone's house than a traditional bar. There are neat little knick knacks, several TVs that play nerdy movies, and they aren't finished setting everything up. They plan to have some rad nerdy art which I am really looking forward to.   I can't wait to see them mature and evolve.

We booked our trip to Vegas and panicked when we realized it was during the Game of Thrones finale. We quickly searched online for a place that airs the show. The Millennium Fandom bar saved the day! We took a $9 uber from the strip. They have around 6 large screen TVs where they aired the GOT finale at both 6pm and 9pm. We were worried we would not be able to hear the show and to our delight the sound was played loudly through the entire bar. All of the patrons knew to stay quiet when it was on. The bar had fun couches and chairs for seating. Drinks were cheap! 4 coronas for $12. Alright! You can order food from the sandwich shop next door and they deliver it. The food was absolutely delicious! The owner of this place has a lot of heart and we could tell he cared about his guests and establishment. Thank you for a wonderful experience!

The moment I walked through the doors, a flood of nerdvana washed over me and embraced me! Actually, that was the owner that was greeting us! Apparently, I guess this place is filled with mostly locals and the owner does a great job of spotting new folks and welcoming us to the unique experience.   I'm going to start off with the awesome decors. His walls are filled with Predator masks, the triforce shield, frostmourne, light sabers, and a R2D2 right in the middle. To be honest, you can have a blast just looking at the walls. The bar itself is pretty small, I would say this place can fit up to a 100 people so it's more like a speak easy size. However, there was hip hop music blaring which made it pretty difficult to talk to. Honestly, the music kind of killed the mood for me because if we wanted loud music we could have been to any of the other hundreds of clubs in Vegas. Instead, I would have preferred video game OSTs or maybe live karaoke. Furthermore, there are a lot of chairs and tables to sit at. Unfortunately, I feel like this works against the bar experience because everyone just sits down with their clique. The environment isn't conducive for people trying to strike up conversations and to mingle.  As for the drinks, this place is a deal. Almost all of the cocktails were $10. I got the BB8 which tasted like an alcoholic horchata. My friend got a double pour of glenffidich for like $10. Beers are $5. Overall, the alcohol here tastes great and is super reasonably priced compared to the $20 drinks you get in Vegas.   Overall, asides from a few critiques, this place is a nerd gem. It's not every day you can drink your scotch next to a R2D2, with a spiderman cosplayer and watching kill la kill. This place gets 2 light sabers up!", "Date": "2016-09-01", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Aaron", "ReviewID": "j-bYIfI7BSvv4vZW_3-Xzg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I'm a regular at this bar and I absolutely love it and I mean LOVE it.  I found out about it via twitter and originally wanted to go for my 21st but couldn't make it. I then found out about their pre party for Wizard World Comic Con and decided to go dressed as Malcolm Reynolds. This bar is a fantastic place for geeky people to come and socialize and to also get away from the  club  crowd of the strip and Fremont. The bar is filled with nothing but wonderful people who are easy to talk to and also geeky artifacts from Raiders of the Lost Ark to Hellraiser.  There are board games and card games to play and cosplay is 100% encouraged!!!!!        I'm a cosplayer who finds it hard outside of Comic Cons to meet like minded people who don't find it weird that I dress like Malcolm Reynolds or Captain Kirk on occasion so it's nice to find a joint that celebrates geek culture and encourages it.  The drink prices are very reasonable especially for a college student like myself and it keeps me coming back. The owner is amazingly cool and nice and always comes to greet me when I come in. The bartenders are nice and it's always cool to see Black Canary lol.  The people who frequent this bar like I said earlier are always nice people and never jerks or typical hell raising party types. In fact just last weekend a few people invited me to a game of Cards Against Humanity and we all ended up playing a good 2 hours.  I don't think that there is a better bar/lounge/hangout in Vegas for geeks or people in general. If you're a gamer, cosplayer, star wars fan, browncoat (like me!!), or a geek in general then this bar is 100% for you.  They also occasionally on special nights like the pre party for Wizard World have a DJ that plays music. During these days the place turns from a lounge to a small club but a really nice and cool club!!!!   There is plenty of parking so don't worry  plenty of beer choices and they even carry my favorite Newcastle Brown Ale which a lot of places don't.   Really great, cool and creative specialty drinks  Really cool bartenders who are all really really awesome and nice people!", "Date": "2016-04-02", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Denise", "ReviewID": "2-_28OVUw0dM90_EEBlB-w", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I finally got down here to check this place out!    I loved The Lady Silvia, so I was glad to see the familiar decor/furniture, though most of the books were gone from the shelf to make way for various geeky fandom artifacts. Upon walking in, my date and I were immediately greeted in a genuine, cheerful manner by both the bartender and the owner (who got up to shake our hands). \  The music was a nice mix of the deep house-ish genre (not distracting in volume or lyric clutter), the lighting was dim (conducive to chilling out), the temp was just right. The owner conversed with us for awhile, filling us in on all of the awesome plans he has for this wonderful bar!    The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was this: we had 2 basic drinks, and the bill was $16. That's a bit steep in my opinion. Were they made well? Sure, but $8 is $8. The owner did mention if individuals wear their cosplay costumes (any day/time), they get 20% off, which would make the prices better to consume multiple libations! The other reason for the 4 stars is how empty the shelves were. Now I will say this, after talking at length with the owner, he expressed that he wants to leave the filling up of many of those shelves to local driven geek/fandom art. And I can 100% appreciate that, I really can. I just would like to see maybe more temporary artifacts up so that walking in and taking in the entirety of the bars aesthetic doesn't leave one feeling that they stumbled in before it was ready/open as opposed to being a work in progress (if that makes sense).   There are already fun nights in the works (Harry Potter meetups, Star wars, board game nights, cosplay nights, etc), and coming up on February 19th is a Steampunk ball!   I'll be excited to see this place grow and once I've gone a few more times, I'm sure my 4 stars will turn to 5!", "Date": "2016-01-20", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "David", "ReviewID": "pXoPlGKDXc8dL6Zs02Q69Q", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Loved it!

It seems like there is always something fun going on like themed nights, viewings and events and the best part is you can dress up or not and still will have an amazing time. You don't have to be an expert at fandom knowledge to appreciate this gem. The walls are filled with beautiful local art and books to give a library feel. It feels like a geeky speak easy in the most amazing way.   I happened to go for my first time with a couple of friends. They ended up leaving early and I decided to stay. Now as a young female I would like to point out that I would never feel comfortable staying at most Vegas bars by myself. However Alex introduced me to some of the locals and it was so much fun! We all watched YouTube videos and carried the conversation till closing. Alex even made sure I got to my car safely!   In just the few hours I spent there I felt I knew the people I met for years. The cute bartenders were amazing as well, giving me suggestions on new drinks to try. Linda was telling me about all the cosplay outfits she owns, she can really pull them off too!

The decor was great, and the staff was friendly. If I'd have to compare it to another local spot, the Golden Tiki comes to mind a little, but Tiki does have a better menu. Speaking of the drinks: they were solid, and come in at $10 a pop for a rocks glass of mixed drink, and ice. My wife and I each had a Rumchata-based drink. She had a  The Dude',  which was like spicy horchata. I had a BB-8, which was creamy, butterscotch horchata goodness. Oh, it should be noted that you do get 20% off your check if you show up in full cosplay regalia though. Which I found a clever way of getting people in costume. My wife and I didn't see anyone dressed up at the time, but we did meet a guy that was at the first San Diego Comic Con, and walked into the pre-gaming for cosplay workshop.   This brings me to what I thought was one of the strong points of this spot: the crowd. The crowd, as a whole, was very welcoming. Though there was the odd, silent hipster couple, most of the crowd was happily nerding out, with a passionate debate happening at the bar over a round of Cards Against Humanity, and other groups discussing cosplay construction and conventions.  It is very much in a transitive state though. There are still lots of hints that it was built on the bones of the Lady Silvia. This means not everything is set up yet, but what is displayed screams nerdy fandom, and geeky potential. Lots of  kingdoms  are represented: DC Comics, Marvel, Game of Thrones, Anime (Cowboy Bebop! Dragon Ball!), Alien, Indiana Jones, Bioshock, Star Wars all over the place, and even some Fast and the Furious thrown in there.

I can go on and on about this bar (and I have...sorry) but you have to go visit it when ever you are in Vegas. Awesome this bar is!!!", "Date": "2016-04-11", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
