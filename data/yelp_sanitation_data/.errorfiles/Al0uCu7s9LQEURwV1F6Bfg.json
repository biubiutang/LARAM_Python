Hands down! Its not as sloppy as Rehab, way nicer, cleaner and overall a better pool party. Drinks are strong and not over priced.. The bartenders here will always take care of you. Recommend getting one of those gay frozen dranks and just having the bartender throw an extra shot of tequila on top just for good measure. This wil definitely get you bombed ASAP. Perfect recipe for actually picking up some Vegas Trash. Well that or just doing Don Simpson amount of blow will all but guarantee you nail some sleaze bag.  Ordered a bucket of chicken fingers and fries, (better than the burgers in my opinion), thing cost about 12 bucks, pretty big portion size, more than enough to feed two people, walked around the pool carrying it like I was the Heisman Trophy statue. Food here isnt bad, not much of a selection but more than enough to hold you over. Really though, no one eats much in vegas, at least i dont. Booze, drugs and one maybe two meals a day will do the trick.  The only downside to this place is that on holiday weekends it can be a nightmare. The fire marshall shuts the door down early and it becomes a total Zoo. Even if you buy tickets off wanttickets.com there is no way of knowing if you will get in or not. The regular admission lines barely move. Luckily I was able to get in on memorial day weekend but that was only after waiting almost a hour and having 4 pieces of arm candy next to me who escorted me in.   I have seen many big name athletes out here as well. Its literally a whose of who of NFL & NBA All stars. The crowd here definitely is a mix of trashy whores who fly into vegas for the weekend to get piped out along with the locals who get paid to get piped out in the back of the Rhino. Avoid this place on holiday weekends if possible, unless you have a insane connection or enough money in your bank account to drop 5 grand and up just to hang around a piss warm pool. Must say I have personally picked up at least 2-8 broads here, end up banging a handful of them, even managed to nail a broad at the pool party in the handicap stall of the mens room. Real classy girl.. The only thing that can rival Wet Republic is Rehab Sunday. Stick to this place for Friday/saturday pool parties and the occasional Holiday weekend Monday.", "Date": "2009-07-08", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "JD", "ReviewID": "Ep-z3ZuK7leH477Tobo0yA", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Holy cow what can I say about this place. Drunk with friends with a lot of cash? You'll have an awesome time.   But of course there is the down side. We bought tickets online for Tiesto and got in line early. When we got in, we claimed a spot along the side of the pool closest to the stage. The water was warm and murky. Gross. But we got in anyway. Beers were $10 or $11. Big souvenir cup drinks were around $30? Filled to the top with ice and then alcohol was poured in. Pricey, but whatever. Good thing we drank a lot before we got there. We got to the pool at 11, went through all the checks, and waited until 3pm for Tiesto to play.   We played my favorite game, people watching. Yeah sure, there were some pretty hot chicks and dudes all around. But holy cow. There were some people that really thought they could flaunt what they didn't have. The trashy ones were the gross ones, wearing XS string bikinis while their bodies were crying for help. And then there were the guys who have obviously done cycles that were splashing any shaking booties they see. Anyways. The lifeguards were always blowing their whistle on someone, for what? I have no clue. The pools were all very crowded by the time Tiesto played.   The lines for the restrooms were LONG. Two girls ran in front of the line because one of them was about to puke. Oh she puked alright. All over the floor and made us wait even longer for the staff to clear a path for us. And then they got kicked out of the stall and were told to wait in the back like everyone else. Thought that was pretty funny.   About half an hour into Tiesto playing, the pools were overcrowded, people were splashing, and people were PEEING in the water. Yeah. You read that right. People were admitting to it. The water got worse looking and I couldn't take it anymore. I thought I was gonna vomit when I saw a guy taking in water and spewing streams of water at boobs and butts. Ugh.  So yeah. Fine place to party with a lot of people.

Chris welcomed us in first. we set up our daybed through him. he walked us in and got us situated. he handed us off to Jenn and Josh who would be the cream of the crop of  hosts . they really know how to treat their customers. Jenn, who is very easy on the eyes btw, was all smiles and bubbly with energy. always checking up on us, making sure that we were having a great time. i don't recall ever thinking  where's our waitress at? . and Josh, man that dude was all over the place. if there were more than 4 ice cubes melted in our bucket, he'd replenish the whole thing. if we used a napkin he would pick it up, dump it and restack. that dude was a machine. and if ever Jenn or Josh weren't around, the other hosts were more than happy to oblige our requests. i know money is a driving force, but, excellent customer service is not always the result. some people just have it in them.  and these 2 were on top of their game.   the crowd at the party was easy going and fun. yes, the douche factor here is greater than perhaps the  free  pools. but, when you're dropping benjamins the way you have to when you're here, you have a different mind set. i had to join in on the doucheyness myself! yes, a lot of people here work out all year, don't eat for days and tan hardcore before coming out. while there are definitely average joes here, like myself, be ready to see Tiggo Bitties on hard bodies, muscles on top of muscles and overall smokin hot physiques. the meat factor is imaginary. these people do not walk around in the real world. but, you will see the unicorn here at Wet.   while the party itself is not something i would do again any time soon, unless i won the lottery, i'm glad we did it. the cost does not exactly equal the return, but, it usually never does when you're paying for entertainment. which is what this pool party is. 4 stars for the party... 5 STARS for Jenn and Josh and the staff at Wet Republic!", "Date": "2012-06-20", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Joe", "ReviewID": "U1LkjA_1a2rLONiJBlu3Mw", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Say it isn't so, but discrimination still exist. (Not that it's new to me) After the fun we had at Marquee pool party my friend thought we can try Wet Republic. We got there Saturday 12:30pm and waited for an hour before we can get in. If you're just a group of guys you get to stay in line, in the sun, at 100 degree for one hour...   My friend was so heat stroked that he wasn't responding when we talked to him...  hey Paul you ok buddy?  We had to have him get out of the line and rest in the shade. There were only 20 people in front of us and we didn't get in until an hour later. It feels like 2 hours because of the sun. At Marquee at least we waited in an air conditioned hotel. So after waiting in line we get a stamp and have to wait another line. No idea why they do this. This is where I get PISSSSS. At the second line we were right in front but had to wait another 30 mins. 20 Mins into it a guy, Steve, told us that if we take care of him he'll take care of us. What?! Come again?! Why cause we happened to come with just guys? Or the fact that I'm Asia and I'm loaded with money? Oh again, waited in the sun. After second line we waited at the third line to pay, and it was $50. Marquee was $30. My friend Paul paid $50, 1 min later he said he's feeling sick and went to go back to hotel room and nap.  The pool wasn't and ultra pool, it was ultra hot with piss. Yeah I said it! I'll say it again, PISS like urine like the pool water shouldn't be this warm and this shallow and have this many people in it. Girls who go in the pool automatically get attacked by guys No I'm not hating trust me let's face it Asian men are not build like a UFC fighters and there were a lot of them there. Dude, what steroid did you take? How much can you bench? Oh 400 lbs? That's it?! Why I did that in eighth grade. LMAO...   PRO:  A lot of WWF, UFC, and AMA fighters look alike at the party. If that's your type go get some  CON: Terrible service... never a smile every staff look up at the sky like they're the lady Gaga or Prince of Wales Long wait in the sun...

I was pretty skeptical at first at the whole  ultra pool  concept. But after I was there, I thought, whatta concept! I was there with my friend who is a local, so we didn't have to wait in line, thank God! because I heard it is always insane. Even though we knew people the rules are still rules, don't bring anything with you or it will get thrown out by Security, including my gum. But they seem to do a good job, keeping it all together, so props to them.  The pool is amazing! Next time I go, I will have to get a cabana because they are situated right next to the pool where the action is. Even so, walking around as a regular person was fine. You just have to figure out what you're going to do with your purse. The area by the bar is so slippery, so tread carefully over to get your expensive drinks. (PS you might want to preparty to cut costs) The bartenders are fast and good at what they do, so that's a definite plus.  The music is perfect for a splashy good time in the pool. Everyone seemed into having fun and not creating drama which created a happy utopia-like party.

Too bad we had to stand on line in 110 degree weather for over 1 hour even though we had prepaid tickets. We witnessed 3 girls fainting because of the heat.  They should have a roof over a section of this or at least some fans with mist b/c they have to do something about this line.   Other than that, they have lockers inside so it's all very organized. The drinks are huge ($38) and come in a protected plastic bottle that can be brought into the pool without having to worry about pool water getting into it. We had a very fun time at the pool, even though it was crowded b/c there was a famous EDM DJ there that day.  People do get a bit out of control and throw beer cans around (one hit my friend in the head) but this is the most 'dangerous' thing that can happen b/c they conduct a thorough search at the door.

They always have good DJ's. This time, it would be my 4th time seeing Steve Aoki.  We came prepared with waterproof phone/wallet cases that strapped to our arms/wrists. This was perfect for the pool party and didn't require paying for one of those expensive lockers. And they were only $4.00 on Overstock.com. I highly recommend them. (Also, if you DO have anything you're hiding inside your valueables, the pouch is hard to reach inside and clear, so they don't spend much time searching it during the extensive security check line. At least not for us.)  When we finally got to Wet Republic after a long trek through the hotel, there was only a short line to get in because it was still so early. We were on the guest list, and girls, so we got in free per the usual.   The pool itself was HUGE, which we expected. And it was still not very busy, so we hurried to get drinks before it would start getting hard to do so. And omg, it was awesome, they had a HUGE cup you could fill with alcohol and bring home with you. For $52, I filled it with Red Bull and vodka, and it lasted me the whole day. Next time I'm going to try and see if I can get them to put in less ice, because they pack it up to dilute the contents.  We sat on the most right pool when you come in. Unfortunately, it wasn't very hopping over there. The large middle pool was where it was at, but we didn't move because my friend wasn't feeling very well.   We stayed from 11:45 am - 4:15 pm. We met up with friends, made new friends, and got to dance to little of Steve Aoki's set. It was a good time. I just wished we didn't have a plane to catch and that my friend was feeling better so we could stay longer.   I'll definitely be back to Wet Republic, for the DJs and the great time.

The type of people that go there are probably the ones that don't really care about costumer service at all. I went to the MGM pool party  at the beginning of July to see Calvin Harris, we were really excited about it, but the disappointment started when we saw the length of the queue, ridiculously long. Anyway, there was nothing that could be done, but standing . After queuing and dropping bags and paying for it we eventually got into the pool area, that day was about 43degrees and we went to the bar to get something to drink, what a joke, it took about 20 to 30 min to get the barman's attention and he gave us Vodka instead of water and we were charged $15 for 2 small bottles. The frustration was taking over and we decided to talk to the manager, they should've had a visible water point with easy access and that's what we were trying to tell him, but he was the rudest person in the world and we felt that all the excitement we had earlier on was absolutely gone, that's when we asked for a ticket refund and he literally laughed at us, trying to say...  Are you kidding me? You are the only one complaining, f*****. So, our conclusion is. MGM pool party is for the very young ones that don't give a S*****.

In true  Hollyweirdo  form, there's a line to get in and they card you so don't forget to stick your ID in your speedo strap so you don't have to walk two miles back to the room to get it like me. There's a cover charge on the weekend if you aren't a guest/owner of the hotel so luckily we didn't have to pay ($10 girls, $20 guys).  Be prepared for a ridiculous wait unless you are a promoter of some sort or a local who knows someone who works the door. I really, really, hate waiting in lines to get into the  hot  spots of the moment, so I took the time to analyze and ridicule those who were working the door. The men wear these baby pink Lacoste polo shirts with the collar popped (so not cool) and white shorts; they have robotic expressions and  a snail like sense of urgency in their efforts to move people through the line as efficiently as possible. There was a short girl with jugs as big as her head along with other severe looking attributes walking to and fro, also not helping much to get people out of the heat and into the pool. My blood continued to boil, not just from the triple digit heat, but also when they requested that all of us in line scoot over to let a magazine promoter and 20+ of his underage looking posse of girls wearing the magazine logo on their tank tops in before us. There were better looking (and of age) people who were waiting in line long before these f***kers; rest assured I don't think any of us in line recall the name of the magazine, nor will we ever have the desire to after that debaucle! :)  Lame thing #2  is that you have to pay for a lounge chair-they quoted us (4 girls) something like $175! N!?#a puhlease, unless those chairs have human hands attached to them that massage you and apply sunscreen to your back I would never be the idiot who pays that laughable fee.  Anyway, when we finally got in I was like,  THIS is what the hype is all about?   It's a decent place to chill but by no means is the pool anything spectacular or awe inspiring.   There's a main pool with a shallow area that houses cool green chairs, which are miraculously free to use if it isn't taken. The pool is all but 4 feet deep-strictly standing room only, so don't worry if you can't swim unless you're 3' tall, and there is a small pool set up for volleyball. Then there's a few narrow wading pools to one side.  A full bar and shaded patio area w/ tables (reserved) overlooks the main pool area. A DJ booth is also posted up here and the one who was spinning was really good-it was perfect summer/poolside music, not just the same ol' shit top 20, so having a live dj was a nice touch.  The bartenders are very nice, the waitresses have the cutest outfits-classy and stylish and they're pretty girls, not the type you'd expect them to have: the typical over done so L.A. Type, which the waitresses are not. The bathrooms are surprisingly clean throughout the day. A tip for the ladies - if you think you're about to get your monthly visitor remember to bring some back up - a poor girl I ran into in the bathroom was desperately searching out some *ahem..feminine products to no avail..and of course no one around had one available, nor do they sell them in the restrooms in those little machines.  This pool attracts the pretentious, try too hard, super sized breast implants, hair, and overbaked, scarily thin set..complete with high heels that are totally impractical, if not a hazard when worn poolside. Trust me I'm not a hater, I know beauty and the aforementioned is not! There are posers, scenesters, and wannabes galore.   Then you have some out of towners totally in awe as though this is what real life is like (well, maybe if real life is a music video) and thankfully, there are a good amount of regular people who get a lot of interesting/twisted people watching time in. It's a circus in there, but a different pool experience.   Good to go just once because the appeal wears out quick. There are cooler pools elsewhere I'm sure, I guess since it's newly opened there's a lot of promotion to build it up so people think it's something special even if it's not.   If you do check it out and it turns out to be too much of a headache to get in, don't waste your time or $. Just mosey on over to the several pools outside of the walls, such as the lazy river. There, you can use the lounge chairs FREE of charge, no cover or line to gain access (the way it should be), free towel service, and even a little bit of shade!

The main reason we came to this day club was to see Tiesto during Memorial Day Weekend 2013.  Unfortunately, we found out that he wouldn't be coming on until 3pm, and we had planned to leave at 2pm at the latest (we had come in pretty early, at 10:30am on no breakfast).  Needless to say, I didn't make it to see Tiesto :(.  We bought presale tix too, which were $40 for girls.  We didn't buy it as soon as they were released though, so maybe they could have been cheaper?  First off, location: The pool is located on the back side of the MGM Grand.  Therefore, if you're coming from the Strip side, you're gonna have to walk through the whole hotel and then some, just to get to the pool.  Keep in mind the shoes you will be wearing, ladies.  We just took a taxi from our hotel so it wasn't a problem finding the location.  When you're leaving and wanting to take a taxi, keep in mind that taxis don't really wait around in the back there (for lack of frequent customers, I think).  The only way a cab will come in is if it's dropping someone else off.  And for some reason, there are several security/hotel workers in the general area, doing NOTHING, yet seemingly unable to help patrons form a taxi line.  My friend and I got a couple cabs stolen from other, rowdier, and more aggressive customers.  I wish I was more intimidating!  GRR.  The pool itself was nothing great.  There were two pools: a larger one in front and a smaller one in back.  We came early enough to secure spots around the pool in the back, and somehow, as the day went on, the front pool got busier and busier, while the back pool remained a lot less cluttered.  Yay!  Drinks are expensive!  I paid about $40 with tip for 32 oz of watermelon mojito (super good, but no mint leaves...hmmm).  I guess this is expected in Vegas though.  I wanted something to eat since I hadn't eaten breakfast, but some friends waited an hour for their order of chicken strips and fries, so I decided to just wait.  Somehow, there are only TWO bathroom stalls (unisex) for the WHOLE POOL AREA.  What the........?  Make sure at the slightest hint you need to go to the bathroom, start standing in line THEN!  Aside from all that, the pool party was pretty fun.  It's pretty awesome partying with everyone in bikinis and swimwear, and getting to drink by the pool with friends!

There were about 15 people there when we arrived and we immediately got in with no problem. The wristbands got us in for free, and the girl that led us in decided to give us a poolside daybed for FREE. (!!!) Keep in mind that this was a Thursday.

We went back on Friday and Saturday as well and although we weren't given a free bed or anything, the waitresses were just as attentive. Get there early to get one of the green lounges, however! Otherwise you'll have to stash your stuff on a random section of concrete. It's $100.00 to rent a cushioned lounge on the weekends, by the way.

My life has been hollow, boring and cold until now, and I just don't understand how people can live without visiting a pool party especially one as bad ass as Wet Republic.   Tips before  having the time of your life  at WR:  -Go Early: Lines form before it opens at 11AM (especially on popular days such as Friday, Saturday and Sunday)  -Coupons are floating around, visit the booth in MGM that gives them out (located inside the hotel right before entering the pool area) (i.e. free for women or $20 off admission for guys)  -Bring only the necessities (ID, money, and credit cards)  -Come early because they have a few free lounge chairs.   The drinks here are typical Vegas (around $15 a drink). My usual is Jack n Diet, but my boyfriend ordered a watermelon mojito which came in a larger glass. So you get more bang for your buck with their specialty drinks.   The music here is down right  Pool Party  music, if there is such a thing as  Pool Party  music.

Wet Republic is awesome.  The mist-machined roofs make the place more bearable, and everybody here is pretty cool and chill to talk to.  My friends and I decided to go VIP and order a deluxe cabana, and there was more than enough room for us to chill.  A long couch, three pool beds, a flatscreen TV to watch the game on, and a super hot hostess.  And when I say super hot... I'm saying 10.  Like she was so damn attractive that the single guys in our party had to pretend to look at their phones while wearing sunglasses to catch a glimpse at our server.  Aside from the attractive people (I mean most of the girls I saw at Wet Republic were at least 7s), there's also some good sustenance served here.  We ordered a bucket of fries and chicken tenders as well as tacos.  They were all terrific.  I also ordered a shrimp cocktail which was exquisite... except the only had five in there.  Well, at least they were huge.  And to wash that all down, aside from the complimentary Fiji water and some Coronas, we had their signature Dragonberry Mojitos, which were EXCELLENT.  The dragonberry mojito is probably now my most favorite alcoholic beverage.  As for the people, I was a little scared of that because I don't know how to swim, but the good thing is if you're swimming here, you'll look like an idiot.  The smell of chlorine is strong, but the ultra pool is normally so crackin that once you get out, you'll taste salt.  In other words, it's probably the dirtiest pool in the world.  I mean think about it... all the hot bodies, sweat... spilled alcohol.  Oh yeah, you the servers will actually go out to the pool and serve you your drinks if you're not in your cabana or bungalow.  The only thing I'd do differently is I'd probably try to get a bungalow next time (though the deluxe cabana is awesome) and I'd pack flipflops.  At 100+ degree heat, the ground gets pretty hot.

My boys and I hit twice while we were in Vegas for a bachelor. If your Spring for the Party Cabana it is definitely worth the extra money. There will be no shortage of talent looking to scope you out.The staff is super-friendly and attentive.   When you're booking talk to Forrest. When you arrive ask for Yanette or Jessica. Don't worry about the large minimums for the cabanas, your dollar goes a long way. There is a great food menu to order from as well as tons of pitchers of drinks and buckets of beers you can order too. It made it really easy to host guests you might meet in the pool.  Now what you've heard is true it is covered with half-naked 20-30 somethings, but the vibe is right. I was surprised by how deuche-free the environment was, maybe a cabana has something to do with it. I'm not a big electro/house fan, but I am now. I found myself fist pumping and splashing water (literally, you'll see when you get there) to house beats. I had the time of my life both days.  The women were looking great. Fellas you def want to come in shape. It will set you apart from the rest of the crowd and the ladies will notice. We met some really great girls both days, who we ended up partying with both nights. That's what Vegas is about meet during the day, party at night.  If you're looking for celebrity appearances it has that too, Prince Harry and J Lo were both there on Saturday, but you'll be having too much fun to care. I couldn't imagine a Vegas trip without it. Wet Republic is easily the best pool party on a Saturday.

Lots of room to sit on couches, with little drawers beneath them to stuff your phones/wallets in and avoid the $40 lockers.  The music was good, crowd was a bit slow at first but picked up after an hour or so, and the water was clean.  Drinks were ridiculously priced, but the food was solid and hit the spot.

We pre-saled it for a Friday in July and it was a breeze.  All the staff we encountered from the security getting in to the bartenders and cocktail servers were all good sports. I'm sure it's easy to be over it as people go too crazy sometimes but all I saw was good vibes from the staff. Kind of suprising really. But it was a good surprise.  It was Hot 100 weekend so it was pretty packed and happening the Friday we were there. We were celebrating a bachelor party for a good friend of mine and none of us had partied at Wet Republic before. Everyone had a great time. The layout of the club is nice and spread out. No one is shoulder to shoulder really in a big group like other day clubs can get. I like how the main bar is shaded. That's huge if you aren't gettting bottle service as there really isn't a lot of shade under that Vegas Summer sun.   Music was good. Crowd was good. It made for a good time. Just a warning with security up front. They're good dudes but they do not let you bring anything that is not essential. I had a pack of gum and 1 airborne tablet (honest).

This meant applying a ton of SPF right before you head to the MGM and pre-gaming enough so you can keep the buzz going. It's like a science Lol. We knew it was an elite day club- we wore cute swim gear/cover ups, etc.   Fast forward about an hour, I am starting to feel thirsty, so we head to the bar. It was $41 for a drink! I know Vegas is expensive, but instead I just offered $20 to have a drink from a bottle service table. Here is why Vegas is my favorite: the guys at the table refused my money, poured me a strong goose cocktail, and let us stay there for the whole afternoon!

The servers were courteous and our hostess was very sweet.  However, at the end of the day, she for some reason had a complete melt-down and started bawling, and we had to close our tab with her.  We still managed to have a good time.  We spent most of the day just gawking at the ridiculousness that surrounded us.  A lot of the people seemed completely wasted and high on something else other than life.  The experience horrified me so much that I canceled my plans of going to Rehab the next day.  I'm not saying that Rehab would be the same type of crowd, but I really wasn't in the mood anymore to find out, even with the possibility of hanging out in a free cabana.

If you are looking for a fantastic pool party then look no further than the (in)famous Wet Republic at MGM! My tip for this place? Either prepay tickets, get on the guest list, win the lottery and buy bottle service or turn up early.  My partner, his friend and I first tried to get in on Friday 4th July to see Afrojack play and the line was absolutely ridiculous! We got told the club was at capacity and would have to wait 5 hours for even a chance of getting in. Wet Republic opens at 11am and we got there around 1/1.30pm so we decided to try again on Sunday 6th to see Tiesto. The next time was perfect! We arrived at 10.45am (we stayed at MGM so we were allowed to access the pool early), queued up and got in with minimal wait time and no issues. We found a little spot on the side of the pool and we stayed there all day, taking it in turns to mind our belongings. It got absolutely CRAZY and everyone was definitely having a good time although drinks are super expensive- on the plus side they are ridiculously strong, especially when you get the $38 yard glasses... they'll keep you going for a while.  Be warned, if you are body conscious you may not enjoy this club until you get white girl wasted as the staff members are all absolutely gorgeous and the hostesses have the bodies of Greek Goddesses. The majority of the club goers are also stunning with  perfect  beach bodies and expensive looking swimsuits, there is a reason this place is a favourite amongst celebrities.  Don't let it get you down though, it is honestly so much fun! The staff and all involved (in my experience) were super friendly, good fun and just wanted to dance around in a pool sipping drinks.", "Date": "2014-07-10", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jennie", "ReviewID": "HvgqBCjRr-WKm9Ys0e96wg", "Overall": "2", "Content": "For all the times I've been to Vegas, Wet Republic was my first pool party.

You're going because you're giving yourself fully to the Vegas party gods, no matter how inconvenient it may be.   With its crowds and ridiculous club-like mentality, Wet Republic is definitely not a place I'd think to go to on my own accord. But as part of a bachelorette party, I was game to follow along with whatever the bride-to-be and other bachelorettes wanted.   If you're not too hung over from the night before, I highly recommend getting there as early as possible. You'll avoid the lines and hopefully get a good spot by the pool without having to pay mucho dinero for a cabana or table. Better yet, get in touch with one of the many promoters who try to get groups on guest lists.   Positives: Good music (with famous DJs spinning quite often), a huge pool, very entertaining people watching.   Negatives: The drinks are outrageously expensive, and there are ridiculous little rules that you have to abide by, like not being allowed to even lean on the back of a VIP booth, crazy thorough searches (seriously, they'll take everything out of your wallet, open your lipstick, and confiscate all gum and mints).

I heard that they only allow girls in the pool but I guess since it was a Monday, guys can go in as well - Food is RIDICULOUSLY expensive.

They have a section where you can lay there and the water is really shallow so you won't drown yourself even if you're sitting indian style.

Encore Beach Club has delivered on its promise of being an awesome day party every year. However, last year, they increased their rates while giving us poor cabana placement so I decided we should see what other Vegas day parties are like. Before booking WET, I read the Yelp reviews thoroughly, but in the end I feel that they weren't that helpful, as they seem to have been written by either scorned general admission stragglers or cute girls that basically had a fun time. My group of yuppy, Bay Area guy friends is pretty different from those two groups, and as such, we went into the experience without much insight from Yelp. This review is meant to fill that gap.   Let's start with the reason anyone even goes to one of these day clubs: to feel like the star of your own rap video. I want to go to a party that is absolutely rocking off the hinges, with an atmosphere that feels VIP-exclusive, where beautiful people are everywhere. And I want to leave with lots of stories to tell.    WET Republic is definitely similar to the experience I described, but fails to truly deliver. The main reason it misses the mark is because whoever is in charge is a fool. Here's why:   Myself and 3 other guys were walking over to the pool party when a rep from WET stopped us and offered us free passes to the pool party.   Where to start about how idiotic this was...  1. We're dressed in swimwear, following signs to the day party you're trying to promote, and you offer us free tickets? That's like if we were in Home Depot walking to the check-out line, and a salesperson stopped us and told us to take the items we were about to buy for free. First, anyone in sales knows that you don't sell what's already been sold. Second, you definitely don't give away what's already been sold for FREE! Good lord.  2. When you're handing out free passes to an event that is literally already in progress, it sends a certain message -- one of desperation. I could see if they decided it was worth cheapening the WET Republic brand a bit in an attempt to fill up their party by handing out free passes to desirable people at other hotels; but giving free passes to a group of dudes in swimwear about 400 feet from the party you're promoting simply creates a bad first impression. By the time we got to the line, part of me didn't even want to go inside because it was clear the party wasn't as exclusive as we were led to believe.  3. Oh, foolish fools! We're four DUDES. Never in my life have I seen club promoters hand out free passes to a large group of guys. A party of the caliber that WET Republic aspires to be is only desirable when there are lots of women in attendance. A male/female ratio that is skewed female is not just desirable -- it's essential. When there are slightly more females than males, men have a much better time, and women enjoy it more too. A sausage fest is no fun for anyone. How it is that somebody in WET Republic's management forgot the golden rule of parties -- that you ALWAYS have more women than men -- is beyond my comprehension.    The party itself had pluses and minuses, but overall was fairly good. It was standard day club fare -- loud house music, throngs of people drinking and having a great time, and model-slash-waitresses parading around bottles of Grey Goose. The main minus was, of course, that there was a 65/35 male to female ratio. At times we'd look over to the pool and it was just a sea of men. If you can overlook that, then you might dig WET Republic. But if you've been to a better day party like Encore Beach Club, you should probably skip this one.", "Date": "2015-07-27", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Alysia", "ReviewID": "yAqJBol-1sidnvINxxScqw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I came here this past Saturday for Tiesto and pre-sale tickets were $57 (including the processing fee).. If you didn't purchase your ticket in advance then they were charging $150 at the door.. The venue is relatively large and this is the place to see and be seen! Some of the most gorgeous women and handsome men will be found at this pool party, and everyone dresses to impress.. Their security staff are on top of everything and are great at making sure that it remains a safe environment for everyone (considering that you're mixing alcohol + high temperatures).. There were a few people that couldn't handle the madness and passed out but their medical staff quickly assisted them and escorted them out for medical attention.. They have a huge shaded bar by the pool and it is one of the larger ones I've seen at a pool.. They offer a full bar including the mixed frozen drinks that you'll find anywhere on the Strip.. A cup of the frozen stuff runs for $18 and sadly you don't get much bang for your buck.. I drank two of these drinks and did not even feel a mild buzz.. The security guards by the shaded VIP area are very friendly and if you're a good looking girl then they will allow you to sit inside the guarded area.. There are many day beds and cabanas surrounding the main pool and they had House/Trance music going all day..

You can do whatever you want in Vegas, but at the very least go to Wet and bring money. I don't care what you need to do to get in...pay $150 for a chaise lounge, slip the entrance attendant a $20 or flash somebody...just do it because on the other side it's mayhem (A.K.A. sex orgy!!!!).   My first experience here differed wildly from the one I had this time around. When we came in April we came and went as we pleased from our chaise lounges to the VIP cabanas, and basically never touched the main pool everyone else was partying in. This time we were part of that crazy main pool and it was incredible!!! yea your feet are going to be burnt walking on the cement and your hair and make-up will inevitably get wet no matter what, but you'll never beat that experience.   If you've never been before, there are a few things you can do to help yourself out if you're a lady. (1) Be SINGLE. Boys always get in the way of easy entrance to clubs and pool parties. They only help when you're trying to get into a strip club. So call them up then. (2) Be HOT. It's Vegas so you don't have to cover up. Wear your best or most revealing swimsuit and outfit. DO do you make-up and hair. And DON't forget your heels. Remember you're in Vegas, not your local community swimming pool. You know what I mean. (3) If you did # 1 and #2 right you probably caught the attention of a Wet Republic employee on your way there and scored yourselves some sweet wrist bands that will get yourself on the guest list. If not, BE ON THE GUESTLIST. You don't want to be standing in line in Vegas. It's hot. (4) In the case this doesn't work out, walk up to any male dude wearing a wet republic uniform and and ask how you can get in....or just walk up to the entrance dude and take care of it. Don't forget your cash folks. If you're ugly, a man, or desperate, it helps out. No offense!!! That's how it works in Vegas right?

There are lockers at $40 for the day to store your stuff in.  They have all types of cell phone charges inside the lockers too. Food and drinks are expensive but who cares.  The food is actually pretty good.  And the servings are pretty large. You can't bring big bags or purses in.  Only tiny clutches.  They make you check large bags ($5) at entry. You can't bring in any type of drugs, even OTC like asprin, ibuprofen, nothing...not even eye drops! You can't bring gum, mints or breath spray.  Security said  nothing that can go in your mouth . The security is way more strict if you go in General Admission or Guestlist line on the left side..  If you're getting a daybed/cabana or have a hookup, and go in on the right side, they don't check your stuff as strict. Get one of those plastic cups with covers filled with liquor.

Mission accomplished.    Day life is not for everyone.  If going clubbing is not your thing then you really won't be interested in day clubbing.  Wet Republic is one of the many club day pools in Las Vegas.  Wet Republic is the day club for MGM.  I believe MGM guests have the privilege to get into line early as well as free or reduced entry.  Just like any clubbing in Las Vegas it is wise to show up early and get on the guest list.  This will increase your chances of getting in for free or a discounted price.    When planning your trip you need to be on the same page with all of the people going with you.  Day life can be crazy and it can get expensive.  If you're all not clear on what to expect then certain people within your party are bound to have a less than ideal experience.  I would start by reading as many reviews on Yelp as you can.  This will give you a good idea of the good and the bad.  I will try and outline a few things here but my experience, like many others here, will be different than the one you may experience.    1. Show up early  Like I said showing up early will help your cause.  You will avoid the rush and perhaps be serviced by the Wet Republic members before they encounter some other rowdy party goers.    2. Get on a guest list or some type of guaranteed entry  The guest list is the cheapest option but may not guarantee you entry for free.  If you follow rule one being on the guest list will only help your situation.  If you disregard rule one then the guest list might not be as valuable of an asset.  If you want to show up later then I would recommend purchasing tickets or reserving a cabana.  If you are choosing the latter then you might not have any need to read the rest of my review as I don't know how that experience will be.  If you choose to purchase tickets than you will have to fork over a good amount of money.  Remember that drinks are not cheap so you will be spending even more money upon entrance.    3.  Dress the part  Visit the Wet Republic website or again read reviews here to make sure that you are dressed properly.  Much like a night club, this day club is all about being fashionable.  You must wear cover ups to get in but bathing suits are obviously encouraged after entering.  Guys cannot wear regular gym shorts over or under swim trunks.  You must wear swim trunks.  Woman need to wear cover up items and again this is a fashion day club experience so don't be surprised if some people look like they are ready to hit the runway.    4.  Bring little  They do have lockers and they may be affordable if you are coming in a large group but for $40 you may want to try and bring as little as possible.  If you don't show up early enough to stake out a spot on the edge of the pool then you may have no other option.  There are no places to sit or stand besides the pool, poolside, and the bar.  When I say sit I mean on the ground.  All other seating is only available for parties who have reserved cabanas.  So, I would just stick to bringing the clothes on your back, your phone, wallet(credit card) and that's it.  Anything additional leaves the chance to be dropped in the pool, lost, or stolen.    5. The crowd  The day I went was quite timid and I was there early and left early so I missed the large crowd.  I think this may be one of the better ways of doing day life if you are not the clubbing type.  Realizing the above, that there is no space and nowhere to sit/stand, you will be surrounded by people in the pool splashing everywhere and floating around drunk.  The water is dirty but most pools are dirty.  This just happens to form a thin film on the top of the water.  It is gross but it is not like you are swimming in this water.  There is a DJ and the music will be loud.  People may be dancing and splashing water.  It is a really fun experience that is only available in Las Vegas.  Finally, I suggest that you try and just let go.  Have a good time and hope for the best.  If you are a hard time party goer than you will be prepared for this but if not it might be a surprise for you.  The drinks are expensive (have I said that yet?) but you have to get the $40 huge plastic cup drink.  I consider it a souvenir cup but I did see staff cleaning up stray cups so beware.  For this drink you can get whatever you want in it.  I know it sounds like a dream come true.  Any drink you want in a huge cup for only $40.  Okay maybe $40 is a lot but again it is a must do at least once no matter where you are in Vegas.  I chose to get a blue mother(you know the rest) and it was awesome.  Money semi-well spent and a really good time.   *I came during the world cup final and they had the game on the huge jumbo tron that spans the front of the DJ booth area.", "Date": "2014-08-03", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jazzmine", "ReviewID": "s86gwDLDGCiWDHrWzTRD8A", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Came Here Yesterday For My First Time And I Must Say It Was The Highlight Of My Birthday Weekend!

The short review is that everything about this pool is bad.  The multiple long lines you wait in (even with a reservation), the insanely high prices, the crowd and the overcrowding, the lack of seating (unless you get a cabana), the wait to buy drinks at the bar, the nasty pool, the staff, and the overall customer service.  Our group had a reservation but we still had to wait in multiple lines for over 45 mins.  Once you get in, there is literally no place to sit unless you have a cabana or day bed reserved.  Like most of the guests, we didn't.  Big mistake.  Without a reservation for  a bed or cabana, you don't have a place to sit and call home and more importantly you don't have a waitress or a place to eat food. Each time we went to the bar it was another 45 minute wait.  If you order food you would have to stand there for another 40 mins while they make it because they dont bring it to you for obvious reasons (too crowded).  Two of my biggest issues are that everything is ridiculously expensive and the service is terrible.  I have no problem spending money but I expect a certain level of service and that does not exist here.  Customer service overall whether it be from the security staff, the bar tenders, the waitresses, or anyone else associated with the operation is absolutely terrible.  You feel like a herd of cattle at every step.  There is no personality to this place or the staff other than I'm a douche just like everyone else in here.  It is shocking to me how poor the service was and at about $13-15 for a beer I was hoping for a little more.  The crowd was not attractive except for a few well placed  guests  that were clearly there as paid eye candy.  It seems that the hotel brings in some hot eastern european girls to just dance in the high visibility areas for hours on end without ever talking to anyone.  All under the guise that they are just pool guests.  Right....sure. Its comical.  I would say it's one of those things you just try once and then never go back but its not even worth it.

It didn't matter that much though that we didn't have to pay an entrance fee because the drinks are so wildly overpriced, so be prepared for that.  There is a really big pool that you can bring your drinks in to. You can dance, sip on your drinks, and have a great time!   Fair warning though, the pool is warm, like really warm.

One piece of advice though, DO NOT OPEN A BAR TAB ESPECIALLY IN THE CABANA BOTTLE SERVICE AREA.  They will over charge you for drinks that you either did not order or that are different than the posted menu rates at the venue and shown on their website.  This is how the waitresses make their money.  Do not tip before you get the bill.  They will add it to your bill anyways and deny the cash you forked over earlier in the day. If you dispute the charges, they will threaten to arrest you with Vegas PD at the premises.  You do not need this kind of argument at the end of what you thought was an enjoyable day.  And the MGM will not get involved to help settle the dispute unless you charge your bill through your room.

The space is limited and if you don't plan on getting in that dirty water and staying put there the whole time don't come! There is absolutely no where to sit and if you do have a seat on the edge of the pool or anywhere near s cabana or day bed you will be asked to get up lol! Point blank and not in a nice way! The security guards are mini robo cops that feel way too entitled for the nickels and dimes they are paid..

Purchased tickets the day they went on sale for Above & Beyond during EDC week. Stood in line for about a half hour to get into the actual venue. At this point there was a huge line for security. I have been to other venues and have NEVER felt like i was in such a police state as this. Pushy security and not pleasant to deal with at all. searched my bag and found a small glass tube of perfume. I didn't even think about something like that not getting in. Took that, even though i asked if i could place it in a zipper bag in my purse. Its not like i was planning on getting in the pool with my perfume....   After Finally getting into the pool area, We decided to look for lockers and get our bearings. The whole area was extremely packed, which i expected, although from pictures i had seen, the venue looked quite a bit larger than it was. Located lockers and was pretty shocked that they expected $50. Since i really didn't have any other options except find somewhere to stash my bag and hope it didn't get stolen, my BF and I decided to just split the price. Too bad they were already sold out!   So I'm stuck holding my bag, which I would not have brought if i had known it was going to be such a pain. Decided to get a drink so we could go find a spot and wait for Above & Beyond to come on. Fast forward an hour, and I'm finally at the bar. There had to have been 10 bartenders for the whole area, Which they could have easily doubled. I know the pool party sold out a month in advance, so its not like they weren't expecting this many people. service was extremely slow, with not so pleasant bartenders. I finally got my drink order (Two long island Ice teas and two smart waters. figured i would go with a strong drink in hopes i would not have to stand in this line again for awhile.) taken by someone who i did not see smile once (Am I not paying for your service? Can I not at least expect a smile?). He took my card and then handed me a receipt to sign. $110?? seriously? For a drink that didn't even taste like alcohol. Oh, but its in a  souvenir cup  so its special, right? A plastic cup that said Wet Republic. looks like a cup I would have bought soda at a gas station in. I have read other reviewers saying they pour strong, but that was not my experience. Seeing as how i just dropped over $100 bucks on two drinks, I really should have had a 32 OZ glass full of booze, but that pretty much covered my drinking money for the day. If i had been on my game and not already upset to the point of just wanting to get out of there ( I guess thats what they want when they charge that  much huh?)  I would have made him reverse the charge and take the drinks back. unfortunately i signed so i am stuck with this charge.   Finally got to the dance floor area right in front of the DJ booth and was able to let loose for the last hour of Above & Beyond. They had a good set and i was able to dance with some other real fans. Thanks to those who helped with this!  Went to find the restroom, and also found the drinking fountain. That would have been nice to know and would have saved me some money....   At this point, a good amount of the people in this venue were not very in control. I guess they had a lot more drinking money on them than me...I was standing in the ankle deep part of the pool and nearly got pulled into a brawl that broke out between some very inebriated partiers. Once i located my shoes that got thrown about in the madness, we decided to leave.   Now, i am basing my pool party experience off of other ones i have attended in vegas, but this was just ridiculous. I bought these tickets as a birthday present to myself so my BF and I could really celebrate and enjoy our favorite DJs in a smaller setting. I guess if you want rude service and very drunk people (I like to party as well, but i know how to keep myself in control and not ruin it for other people too.), go for it, otherwise i advise staying away from this venue. And if you think its  normal  to pay that much for drinks, there is something seriously wrong with that. I know its Vegas and i expect to pay above average, but this is just highway robbery.", "Date": "2015-07-03", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Teiana", "ReviewID": "BpsbXLdAlicBTPqJE9cOww", "Overall": "3", "Content": "So, we arrived at MGM Grand and took a 9 min trek through the hotel to get to the main pool.
