It has a very old school feel with pictures of old school Vegas. The server was awesome (minus the Raiders shirt), nice and very attentive.   On to the food, I hate reading too many positive reviews about a place because then it places my expectations too high and all I read was how good Ichabod's nachos are. Well... the reviewers were right, the nachos were pretty good. I didn't want to believe people when they said it was some of the best in the city but it definitely warrants top 5 consideration.

As for the Bar part.......well.  I heart Ichabod's, but it's atmosphere in the Lounge is a little depressing.  But depression has it's place.  I wouldn't recommend Ichabod's for a swinging group get together....but with Valentine's Day approaching it's time to consider a place to go and wallow in ones tears.  The perfect place to pull up a stool and reflect over a Tom Collins or 5....alone.  Oddly it's decor is cozy , not sad in any way, very green but something a little haunting still seeps in.  Maybe it was built on an Indian burial ground.  In closing.....I would drown my   mean reds  in Ichabod's any day.

It's a fun spectacle that must be experienced to be appreciated fully,  I had the Neptune wrap for lunch today.  It was quite tasty.  The avocado was fresh and the French fries are coated with something that give them a little extra crunch.  I think the Strawberry Fields salad is on the agenda for my next visit.  I was offered a candied walnut from the salad by my lunch companion and it was sweet, but not disgustingly sugar crusty like your typical candied walnut.  My only real complaint is that they are used to working with a senior citizen clientele here, so service can be a little slow.

The salad bar is great it's always fresh ingredients and always constantly gets refilled so that it never runs low. I have eaten here a couple times and always get something new. The omelettes are great and they offer a variety of different types and also classics. The pastrami sandwich is delicious its low fat pastrami that doesn't mess with the quality of the taste.   I could keep rambling on about this place, but i won't lol!

It's a very cool  old Vegas  joint as many note.  Even lunch on a weekday had a nice vibe to it.  It was dark, low key, with nice music playing.  I had the San Francisco sourdough burger, which comes with cheese and mushrooms on parmesan bread.  I added fried onions, as I usually do when fried onions are available.  The bread was great, you could definitely taste the parmesan.  But, it was overly greasy, which got worse when you add the cheese and the burger patty.  The chipotle mayo was very good, had a nice kick to it.  But, annoyingly, I was not given my fried onions with the order.  So, I ate the first half of the burger without them.  They are solid, basically small onion rings.  I recommend them, and hopefully you get them with your meal.  Instead of fries, I tried the potato wedges at the recommendation of the server.  They were good, but not homemade.  I did prefer them to fries, so she was right on in that regard.  Every employee was very friendly.  I'll return and likely try an entrée next time, and I'm sure I'll update my review to 4 stars.

It is located in a shopping center so I was surprised when we walked in and saw that the decor is very old Vegas - low lighting, red tablecloths, candles on the tables.  As mentioned in other reviews, the bar and dining area are separated.  If you have children in your party, you enter the dining room through the door on your left.  The prices were very reasonable (less than $10 per person for breakfast and lunch).  I had the Monterey Chicken Philly with no mushrooms and the dressing on the side.  The roll tasted nice but was large and the chicken did not fill it all.  I guess I am used to seeing the meat spilling out of a philly.  The fries were adequate.  My husband had his standard two eggs, hash browns, and toast.  A plus was the availability of turkey sausage (although there is a small extra charge).  He said it was nice - which is a compliment.  Our waitress, Debbie, was very nice and attentive.  She was busy but still came by to check on us and fill our drinks.  I would return to Ichabods except for one thing - the toddler.  She was a little loud for the atmosphere.  If you do take little ones, keep in mind that Ichabods does not have a children's menu - thus no crayons - so bring something to keep them occupied.  This is certainly not a complaint about the restaurant, just an observation.  Other than that, Ichabods was pleasant and well worth the money.

This is nice so the smoke doesn't overpower the dinning room. It's a quiet, dark atmosphere in the dinning room. It has nice booths and some tables and chairs in the middle. They have a nice small salad bar in the back too.   Service: They are a bit slow here sometimes, but depends on the waitress you get. Mostly they seem pretty friendly. I liked the waitress we had today.   Food:  So far the food has been pretty good. The prices are middle ranged, but true have nice sized potions.  This time I ordered off the daily special menu and got the clams linguini.  It was good. Lots of clams, lots of garlic (maybe a tad bit much), and good sized portion. It came with 2 small pieces of very good garlic toast.  My Grandpa got the prime rib. It was a big portion, and he loved it. I took a bite, and it was tender and cooked perfectly for me.

This was my first time here. The decor is the best I have ever seen in a Sports Bar. There are two areas, a bar with dining area and a separate dining area, bar smoking, dining non smoking. The chairs at the tables in the bar area are like someone would see in a gourmet restaurant, in fact if you took a picture of the tabletop and chairs and showed it to people everyone would say it was a picture from a gourmet restaurant. The bartender was friendly and I was chatting with two people sitting next to me. The  next morning I had a urge for Chicken Fried Steak, so Ichabods. Arrived a little after 7am, sat at the bar and ordered. When it arrived the eggs were done properly but very small. The home fries were excellent. The Chicken Fried Steak, the star of the show, was terrible. The meat was very small surrounded with a lot of breading, which was not crunchy and had no flavor. The gravy was tasteless also.It gets worse, every 24/7 sports bars serves this item, price ranges from $4.95 to $7.95. this one was $10.95.

After mentioning how disappointed we'd be to take our business to Outback, the hostess quickly found a booth she could clean up to fit us. After a short wait it was ready, we were seated and began to peruse the menu.  The atmosphere is pretty nice, though it's definitely dark. The lounge area is completely blocked off from the restaurant, which allows people to smoke at the bar as well as letting the establishment serve food. While we were there they had a guy playing piano and later he was accompanied by a man playing the flute.   My boyfriend and I ordered the prime rib special, an order of hot wings and the greek town cheese-steak with chicken. The prime rib came with the unlimited soup and salad bar; most of the veggies looked fresh enough, there was a lot of canned things available, about 4 dressings and two soups were out, though one of the soups was pretty low. When the wings were brought out, they seemed a little undercooked. The meat had a chewy texture, not crispy at all- and was juicy to the point of almost pink.   The prime rib was very pink and tender and came with a tasty horseradish sauce. The mashed potatoes were chunky, so that's a plus; means they most likely used real potatoes.   The greek town sandwich was alright, but the chicken breast was a little dry. The fries it came with were good.   Our friends ordered a cheeseburger well-done and it came out pink in the middle. He sent it back and the second one was a little more finished but not cooked all the way through.  The nachos looked good; they were a HUGE portion! Definitely not an appetizer for one or two people, it's geared towards feeding a whole table.   The portions were big and the food was decent but nothing to get supremely worked up over.

You can smoke, drink, dine and gamble in the bar area, which is separated from their regular dining room.  The patrons and staff are a cross-section of young and old, but everyone is very friendly.   The Saturday night we were there, they even had a piano player serenading us while we enjoyed our well-prepared entrees of grilled pork chops (me) and NY Steak (him). The piano player even takes requests!   Service was friendly, albeit a tad slow, but it was a full house and our server was also training someone, so we cut her some slack.   I felt like I was in one of those wonderful supper clubs you see in movies from the 60's, where people gather to enjoy good food, good music and a little tobacco throughout the evening.  Ahhh, the good ol' days!  Ichabod's is now at the top of my list of dining establishments in Las Vegas that accommodate smokers AND has terrific food.  After reading the other reviews here, I can't wait to go back and try their nachos as I am a self-proclaimed  Nacho Slut !

I was unsure of the vibe and theme they wanted to give off, but after my visit I'd say it's a diner with better food and a in a classier hangout spot for the older crowd.   It was cute hearing the patrons and servers talking like friends. You can tell the customers are repeat customers who come often aka regulars.  I had a California club with potato wedges and a cup of Manhattan clam chowder. My friend only got a side of fries because she wasn't hungry and it totaled about $15. I thought it was a lot of food and the quality of the food was surprisingly really good. Those were the best potato wedges I've ever had in my life! The club had buttered bread that was toasted and I thought it was a nice touch.  The staff was really nice and the restaurant was really clean. The food came out slower than one might be used to, but not slow. & I didn't care because the food was good. They have a huge menu with pastas, fish dishes, steaks, and the typical breakfast stuff like omelettes and pancakes.  My only complaint about the place has to be the smell. It smells of cigarettes and something off putting. We sat on the side away from the bar but it still smelled. It's probably just because it's old.

I love this restaurant, their service is excellent and is a model that should be used everywhere. We are a small group of 3-4 who eat every Tuesday night after our class. The employees have ALL gone out of their way to accommodate our needs. We are welcomed like family and they know what we like to order. They have offered split salads, they make sure our different dietary requirements are met, and even our special occasions are acknowledged like birthdays. We are in love with the hot spinach salad and salmon! We miss the pizza fries, we have ordered eggs and potatoes and it has all been delicious.  We thank the twins who started serving us but no longer work on Tuesdays, Shannon is our regular server and makes sure we are happy. Frankie sometimes serves us when we arrive in between shifts, Juan comes out of the kitchen  and serves and cooks for us, Kim starts us with drinks, and Chris the night bartender always walks us outside to make sure we get into our cars safely. This is all great, and they go above and beyond and we truly appreciate all of you!  The restaurant is located on the eastside of the Strip in a shopping center. Once you enter you are brought into an old world style of Las Vegas. The great difference, a SMOKE FREE GLASS ENCLOSED ROOM! (This is how we found Ichabods) I have asthma so it makes a difference. There is live music , and old photographs that are fun to look at. You can sit up at the bar or enjoy the comfy seating they have throughout the restaurant, me I stay in that glass room!

Most of the time, it's just not worth it if all you want is a quick, no-fuss meal in a quiet spot.  That's where Ichabod's comes in.  Located in a kind of blah strip mall, Ichabod's doesn't look like much from the outside.  Actually, it doesn't look like much from the inside, either - it's quite dark, with strips of Xmas lights running around the walls, and green plants spilling out of boxes atop the dividers between booths (I guess they must be fake, since sunlight rarely penetrates Ichabod's).  It's usually slow, and the servers don't seem all that enthusiastic, and are sometimes hard to find.  The food makes up for the depressing ambience, though.  The Bloody Marys are excellent, and I'm told that their soups are great as well.  The menu is pretty casual, diner-type stuff - lots of sandwiches and salads.  Their wraps are the specialty, and definitely worth trying, especially the chicken caesar wrap and the Neptune wrap.  Packed with meats and veggies wrapped inside spinach- or tomato-flavored wraps, they're huge and tasty.  There's some kind of salad bar there, too, but I've always been afraid of its janky appearance (though that's kind of an Ichabod's theme).  This is by no means a hip or trendy place, and if you see other diners at all, they'll be older couples and families.  But if you're tired of the touristy throngs and just want to go someplace where you can walk right in and be seated (and not pay $12 for a burger), turn to the dark side and try Ichabod's.", "Date": "2006-07-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Michelle", "ReviewID": "00v8chzQWEIDoF45BNbZzw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "What a Great Place to go out and eat and enjoy your company.  5 of us had dinner in the Lounge area while the Piano Player played great music.

Their super yummy seafood salad.  The worst part?  Their AWFUL service.  Ichabod's is near my work so I have been here several times for lunch and every time we've had bad service.  We almost always have to wave someone down to get a refill on our water, and getting the check can sometimes take 20 minutes.  If you have an hour lunch... you can expect to use the whole hour, and you might even be late.    Come on, Ichabod's... get your act together.  Your food's pretty decent and you could have a good lunch crowd if your service didn't suck.", "Date": "2010-12-08", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
