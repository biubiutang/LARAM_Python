A little smaller than their Tropicana location with outdoor dining accommodations, service is quick and  easy, menu items and prices are the same, and the tacos are pretty good. I got an Al Pastor and a Tripa Taco. I Like my tripa(Beef Intestine, NOT tripe!) extra crispy and luckily there were some crispy ones available!  The tacos were good, but for the Al Pastor one, I wish that they would cook the pineapple with the meat, instead of hacking a piece off and placing it on the taco. Nevertheless, they were both solid.. This is one of the many dining options you have while checking out Broadacres with the family!  ALOHA!!!

This place puts any other Mexican taco restaurant to shame. I honestly don't want a lot of people finding out about this place because I wanna keep it a secret so it doesn't get too crowded but at the same time this place deserves to be known a bit more. If you read this review come check out tacks Tijuana and don't tell too many people about it tho. I always like that I can find seats in this place and that it's not that expensive. (Please tacos Tijuana don't ever raise your prices). Haha anyway I definitely recommend and don't get too addicted like I got.", "Date": "2016-10-30", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
