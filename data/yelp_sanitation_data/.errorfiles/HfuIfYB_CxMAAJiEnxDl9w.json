Please don't waste your time, money, or health here.  The only good part of this place is how it looked upon walking in the doors. Some of the food was decent, but other dishes were disgusting, room temperature, and didn't appear fresh whatsoever. Even the water didn't taste quite right here. Not to mention the huge periods of time we were left with our waitress.. It wasn't even busy. This place used to be okay, but you can tell by most reviews that it's been spiraling downward in the last few years.   5 out of 6 of us who ate their ended up with our stomachs doing flips by the evening without any other meals in between. Feeling absolutely nauseated and violently throwing up + diarrhea, 3 of us went to the hospital to learn that we had a stomach bug or norovirus from eating here. The food may have been old, handled by an infected person or someone who had fecal matter on their hands, which is already a nasty topic discussed in other reviews of this place. I can't stress it enough, avoid this place if you are in the mood for sushi.", "Date": "2014-01-29", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jade", "ReviewID": "junQl9BXIiqUp8_kv-HXTw", "Overall": "3", "Content": "It's in my hood, but never tried it until now. They recently have extended their hours on some nights to 2am so we went for some late noshing.   They have a roll menu, a full menu, a late night menu so we ordered something from each.   Tako Yaki from the late night ($4.95, 5 pcs)- the batter was great, crisp outside and the inside has a soft gooey consistency but not mushy. There is a big problem though- where was the tako? My first ball had none at all. The second did but it was small and same with the following balls. I took a picture to show you the biggest piece of tako I got next to the size of the ball. Just sayin' it's not crispy balls of dough, it's key word is tako so if you make it, please put it in. Shame,  their batter texture is spot on.   Final Fantasy 2 roll (inside- spicy soft shell crab, tempura, cucumber. outside is more spicy soft shell crab and mixed fish- $12.95) as you can see from the pic, the roll is pretty filled. It was good, but it wasn't a  fantasy . I appreciate the sauce was a happy medium between a light ponzu and spicy mayo sauce and served on the side so the roll doesnt sog.   Hibachi Beef ($13.95)- diced ribeye with zucchini, mushrooms and onions on a sizzling plate w/ a citrus sauce. The meat was good, soft and juicy and veggies were fresh. Came with rice, miso soup-a tad salty for me, and salad- good dressing thats a cross between ginger dressing and thousand island but the greens were swimming in it.  The service was pretty good.   The look of the place is very cool, nicely decorated, but the ambiance isn't quite there because of how dirty the booth is. I put a picture up of the wall next to me with black smudges. It's probably stupid kids getting a hold of the sushi menu pencils they leave on the table with stupid parents who don't know how to keep their kids proper, but you should clean that up. Also, the booth is a cool color of microsuede, but the problem with that is you get it smudged and it looks so dirty....there was caked on sauce smudge at the end of the booth where the BF was sitting. I was gonna get a picture, but I didn't need my flash to go off under the table and making me ousted since were the only people left before closing. Sure, I've eaten at dives, hole in the walls that are grimy but if you have this nice of a place I would think maintaining it's nice character should be a given.   The food was good, but nothing I would say set this above and beyond other sushi spots....A-OK food. New Years Eve just past, I did my deep cleaning but Loca didn't.

I had high expectations for this place in terms of food and sushi rolls. We were heavily let down.   The sashimi here - great. Nice big cuts and pretty good quality.  The Steak Hamachi dinner here is awesome! My favorite dish by far!  Let's get down to the sushi rolls here - the reason we came. They are just ok.  They have the potential to be great - but they miss. Most of the rolls are heavily-laden with sauce which drowns out much of the taste and flavor. The rolls are deceivingly big. The rolls are stuffed with tons of  spicy  crab  and their  soft-shell crab . Making for just a filler and topper of the rolls.   All of these rolls seem to be badly poor knock-offs of rolls found at 'I Love Sushi'. The names on the rolls are different  - and so is the quality and the amount of real fish you are actually getting.   Rolls we ate: TTL- Favorite of all the rolls Final Fantasy 2 - Second favorite  Put your hands up  Jackpot  Taste like my ex gf I did your gf No Pain No Gain - least favorite - way too much sauce all drenched over it.  If you don't believe me - I implore you to go eat at 'I Love Sushi' to taste the difference.  If I lived on this end of town - this wouldn't be a terrible go-to. But knowing that other sushi places out there trump this place; for that I can only give this place three stars.", "Date": "2016-03-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Carissa", "ReviewID": "wRmV9zPErYpK0KBxuLuDcw", "Overall": "3", "Content": "9:30pm on a Saturday we came in with a group of friends.  Apparently because it was later in the evening (they close at 11) the mad rush before us wore them out and their energy level was at an all time low based on our past experiences.    First off the mood of the place wasn't as it usually was.  The music was down low (which usually is so bumpin by this time of night) and there wasnt any loud exciting greetings when we walked in the door as we have always had in the past. There were still quite a few people there being that it was later in the night which dwendled down the longer we were there.    We asked at the beginning that we have the bill separated accordingly which they said wasnt a problem.  We ordered some drinks and then ordered our first round of rolls etc.  The food came out timely.  Our first round of food was done and the plates occupied the whole middle of the table the rest of the time we were there chatting and finishing our drinks.  We would have loved to put some more orders in however the servers were MIA.  This was a big bummer because I was still hungry!!!  Grrr.  When the bill came out it wasnt separated as discussed in the beginning.  Not to mention we didnt realize till we saw the bill that there were things we ordered that we never received but were charged for.  Carazay.  lol   So another 15 minutes trying to separate what everyone ordered and deleting the orders that we didnt receive etc...still all while the pile of dishes took up most the table.  My added pic says it all.  Between all of us we all ordered a little bit of everything so too much to remember.  But there were no complaints about the food other than we didnt get all of what we ordered and we were still hungry.  The service is huge for this place though.  I've always thought the service made this place stand out from the others and maybe it was an off night for the crew.  Hopefully the next time I can put this back on the 4-5 stars which is expected.  The only reason for the 3 starts is their food is good!  And the past experiences have been good ones.

I was slightly grossed out, while my wife was exceedingly grossed out (to the max-insert valley girl accent here.)   I handed the ramekin to the server, pointing out our visitor. He acknowledged the pest, but did not apologize, and left the table.   Our issue? Nobody ever came back to the table about this incident. No manager visit at all. Nothing.   I'd also like to point out that if you can see roaches in the front of the house, then there most certainly are roaches in the back of the house.   Sushi restaurants are a dime a dozen here.

No they do not have AYCE but their portions for their rolls are really great. I'm saying they are pretty huge. Especially the tempura or crunch rolls. So it's fine to me.

It can start to get quite roudy at times with the chefs at the sushi bar whooping it up with the patrons sitting there.

Plus all the noise can interfere with conversations you are trying to have with your family/friends.   Perhaps not the best environment for young children either (sushi wise), as the names on several of the rolls refer to actions taken with the genitalia.

Sushi loca was recommended by another friend and through yelp.  I went there around 7pm Friday and the place was packed.  The energy was really high and exciting, but I was not feeling it.  I was expecting a quite and relaxing eventing dinner with my mom.  The music was so loud that I could not heard the server and the server was having a hard time hearing us.    This is what I ordered:  Spicy Tuna Roll was too mushy.  I had better at Yamaguchi Sushi.  Spider Roll was good, but I like Hikari Sushi version better.  Soft Shell Crab Roll was a bit spicy and dry.  It was like eating crab cake over cooked in the oven.  Caterpiller Roll was good.  Rainbow Roll - the fish was not as fresh as Hikari.  It was dry and left out too long.  Volcano no rice - This was the only think that stands out at Sushi Loca.  There were plenty of imitation crab meat with cream cheese wrap with a thin outer layer of Tuna.  The rolls were bake in Yum Yum sauce.  Overall the price is resonable, but it is not the best sushi place in town unless you live in the extreme Northwest.

You may be expecting some type of Japanese-Mexican fusion right? Wrong. When you walk in it's farrrrrrr from commerical.  Sushi Loca has got to be one of the most authentic Japanese sushi restaurants I've ever been to.  The servers are dressed up in traditional Japanese gear and the sushi chefs are so incredibly friendly and fun that it makes you want to be a regular there all the time.    Most recommended roll: Fat Ass Roll --what? what was that?  Did you just say  Fat Ass ?  Will it make me fat?  Well, quite possibly so but with something like this in your mouth you'll be screaming--  fatten me up baby!   Hey, how ever many fat ass rolls you indulge is entirely up to you.  But I promise that you will never taste a sushi like this more delicious in your life.  I'd describe what's in it but honestly with something like this in your mouth, do I really need to?  Just trust me.  I've abandoned my Lion King roll all together and I'm cheating on it with the Fat Ass roll.  That is how serious of a relationship I have with this Mr. Fat Ass.  Their fish is so fresh it makes you wonder,  how the heck did they get such fresh fish to the Las Vegas desert?   We found out that they get a fresh shipment flown over daily and delivered from Hawaii, Asia and all the yummy places you expect fresh fish to come from.  All their rolls are excellent...they even make boring California rolls a delicious art.  Everything from their edamame  to the fresh oranges they give you after your meal.  Ask for Jack--he's our favorite sushi chef-sters.  If you are in the North Las Vegas area, it would be a shame if you don't stop by this place and give a warm  Arigato  for their excellent roll-o's.

It is a little pricey, and some of the rolls have interesting names, but it's definitely worth a visit.", "Date": "2012-08-03", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Zulma", "ReviewID": "o8I78WlX6F4CT6Ir4L31og", "Overall": "5", "Content": "We love Sushi Loca!

One of the sushi chefs was obviously sick or had allergies, because he was sniffling with a runny nose the whole time he was making sushi. He sneezed twice while making sushi rolls, without washing his hands. Then a customer came in, and the sushi chef shook the customers hands with the gloves on that he made sushi with, then without washing or changing gloves, he went back to making sushi....it was discussing, and I'll NEVER GO BACK.", "Date": "2014-09-13", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Trina", "ReviewID": "UzHcPB4ychTENLQJj_Pl-Q", "Overall": "4", "Content": "We found this restaurant through CitySearch and noticed the rave reviews. Being a foodie, I decided to check it out the other night. Where I live in Vegas, it's a 9 minute drive on the freeway, so it's close. It's also located in a very nice area of town, which brought my hopes up. Going with a previous review stating that this was better than Nobu--which honestly did not impress me when I went last week--I wanted to see what an off strip Sushi bar could offer.  Walking into the place, you feel like you've steped into a posh Japanese sushi bar. The colors and layout is fantastic, and there are at least four sushi chefs on hand at all times. I loved the menu offerings, from cold and hot appetizers to the infamous hibachi and bento boxes. As any great sushi bar will have, they offer the Americanized rolls but have a beautiful variety of sushi to order. We ordered the Man dai sushi (Japanese snapper) and garlic tuna sushi, along with shrimp & vegetable tempura appetizer, beef teriyaki (cut up ribeye) appetizer, fried gyoza, Nobu special roll, and yellowtail jalapeno sashimi (which they offer at Nobu for three times the price).  I have to say that as a person who grew up on a Pacific Island and having access to authentic Asia cuisine, including breathtaking Japanese sushi chefs and their culinary expertise, this place ranks on my top five places in Las Vegas to go for sushi. Not only were the flavors beautiful and clean, but their service was impeccable, their servers dressed (the women only) in kimonos which added to the authenticity of the restaurant, and the traditional Japanese greetings coming in and leaving. Add on the experience with honest-to-god beautiful and very delictable Japanese cuisines, and you have yourself a fantastic restaurant off the strip that is much better than what the hotels have to offer.  I know some people may think that I am exxagerating, but you have to try it to understand the beauty in their food.", "Date": "2010-02-18", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
