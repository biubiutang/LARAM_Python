The good part is that every trip was great! I was really, really skeptical when my co-workers informed me of a  good  sushi joint in Anthem, so it took them a while to convince me to take a trip here. I'm definitely glad they did.   What's different from other sushi restaurants is probably the most important. I like that they have several, really delicious, no-rice sushi options. Very cool for those that want to watch their carb intake (diabetics!). Also, this is a non-AYCE sushi joint. Not everyone's cup of tea, but I think that attributes to the freshness and quality of fish.  My favorite no-rice dishes are the Spring Mountain Roll (spicy soft shell crab, shrimp tempura, avocado, radish sprout, eel, wrapped in rice paper, topped with spicy mayo and sriracha) and the Screaming Orgasm (tuna sashimi or seared, lots of julienned daikon, sauces galore, tobbiko, green onions). The Spring Mountain Roll is probably my overall favorite sushi roll. The last time I was there, the chefs gave us a bowl of tempura jalape√±o. Not something I would ever order, but they were so good! And not terribly spicy either.   My only gripe was the terrible quality of the Ikura on my last visit. It was not good. But, to their defense, I hardly find really delicious Ikura or Uni in the valley. Other than that, it's just really busy during dinner. Service is usually pretty good, no complaints, but nothing amazing.  Overall, great place for a sushi fix!", "Date": "2013-08-23", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "hA6K-j3UkvB5t4w8aYlALA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Finally.  After trying about half a dozen sushi joints in town, I think my wife and I found one we will go back to regularly.  I Love Sushi gained instant credibility because a.) it was actually crowded when we went there (on a Monday no less) and b.) they didn't have some incredibly priced ala carte menu to entice you into their  all you can eat  offering.  I think my wife and I would each get our rolls again (I Love Sushi roll, The Mistake roll, some roll that had the word  nipple  in it, and another one I forget the name of).  The highlight for me was the sashimi.  For $5 the portion was great.  Three very thick pieces of salmon and incredibly dark/fresh tuna.  The salmon was delicious and maybe the best salmon sashimi I've had, same for the tuna.  In the words Ahhhnold,  I'll be back.

This place is easily the best sushi in the desert especially for the price. Quality, Freshness, and Service are always top notch.

Now, living over 20 miles away, I crave it almost every month and MUST make the trip over. The variety of rolls makes it easy to find something that combines every kind of sushi you enjoy (i.e. Mistake Roll). The service is always the right mix of attentiveness and consideration. Most of all the prices are a value for the quality (but not on the lowest end of the spectrum).

Before I even get to saying how amazing the food was I will start with the atmosphere. We got sat at a table with walls around it so it was almost like having our own room. The waitresses wear traditional Japanese garments and speak very little English. It's considered casual but you would look a little under dressed if you showed up in board shorts and flip flops. It is a very cool setup and added to the experience.   Now about the amazing food. Sadly enough I didn't try the sushi but I did get the vegetable tempura which was absolutely amazing. Hands down the best I have ever had. My sister got the chicken Lo mein and it had such an amazing flavor to it I wanted to eat her whole meal! My boyfriend got the platter with shrimp tempura and teriyaki chicken. It was huge and he loved it. I think he picked the best thing on the menu!   Overall it was amazing and definetly will be a returning customer.", "Date": "2011-06-11", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jack", "ReviewID": "FDNzCQCZhCgtFm4LLL5DVg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Fabulous sushi, wonderful.

I always try to go with someone who is more knowledgeable about ordering sushi than I am. This time I went with my adult daughter, who frequently eats sushi in LA, her home. When it came time to order, I prevailed on her to go with a  boat.  We ordered the sushi boat for 2 with 3 of us eating. The meal started with miso soup and a small salad - both tasty. The portion of food in the boat was huge, more than enough food for 3, with a nice variety of sushi and sashimi. Everything tasted fresh. The service was attentive despite the restaurant being very crowded and all the tables full.

The service is very friendly, and the atmosphere is a happy one.  I have been here 7 times, and plan on continuing to go back.

We came in during dinner time and they were packed. We were seated at the bar. Our sushi chef was friendly and nice.  We typically like to eat sashimi/nigiri. The selection of special fish are limited. Our go to is uni and it was nice and fresh here. We ordered the toro (fatty tuna) and it melted in your mouth. Other than that, everything else here was standard. The fish is fresh here because they stay busy. We also tried the oyster shooter and the uni shooter. I really didn't like it because it was salty, maybe it was the ponzu sauce? We had one roll, I think it was the Joe's roll? It was good.  I don't think this will be my go to place but I would come back.", "Date": "2016-07-31", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jeremy", "ReviewID": "bI2NsnQRvJSB6jdtEi4bsg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Great food and authentic japanese style...lots of action and friendly with chefs.

I've taken out-of-town guests there 3 or 4 times, and all have left with little japanese food babies and big smiles.  You can miss it easily, as it's tucked into the back of a strip mall...with one tiny little sign to let you know where to turn.  But if you miss it, keep circling until you find it...it's worth it.  Consistently fresh sushi, and reasonable prices.  Great, dark wood decor, with serving staff in full traditional dress.  I always feel like I'm on a little fantastic voyage away from Vegas when I step in here.  Service isn't as great as some others in the valley, but the price is right, so I can cope with a little less butt-kissing.  One of my top sushi picks in the city.

The roll was deep fried, and decent, however we decided not to risk anymore bad fish and move on with our evening.
