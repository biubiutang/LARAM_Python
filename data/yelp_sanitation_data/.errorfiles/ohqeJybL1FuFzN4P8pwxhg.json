But it seems like everytime I go in, the service is worse.  Breakfast of course, is busiest, today was no different.  I saw only three workers, one running the registers, and two other women preparing the bagels.  Most baskets displaying the bagels were empty, so we had to ask if certain ones were available.  I waited about five minutes before someone took my order.  I ordered two breakfast sandwiches to go and asked if they could cut the sandwich in half and wrap it like a sandwich instead of putting it in a box.  I got a look of  are you serious , but she went ahead and did anyway.  After waiting what seems like forever (probably 10 minutes maybe) we finally got our order and they were both wrong!!!    My son had the Applewood bacon and cheddar breakfast sandwich.  His sandwich was cold and had just a tiny piece of bacon in it.  My sandwich wasnt cut and didnt have any schmear on it!!!  My side orders were also missing.    When I told the guy at the register what was wrong, he turned around to the other two women and from what I could understand, told them what I was missing.  Well they looked at me like they didnt care.  You know the feeling you get when someone is talking about you, well thats what I got, because the look that I got was enought to piss me off!!! Just because I dont look like I speak spanish, guess what, I understood you word for word.  This store should be ashamed of themselves for thinking that they can talk about customers in front of their face.    I've rarely gone back to this Einstein store for the lack of customer service they provide and how slow their service is.

You can also get lox (salmon), bagel sandwiches, and they have cookies and muffins in their display as well. Must I also mention Nutella is a choice of spread?!  Customer service is always spot on. The people working are very helpful and patient (goes a long way in coffee shops with intricate/extensive orders). Be sure to order a cup of coffee and try their freshly brewed Vanilla Hazelnut.

Linda. You ever wonder why some of the meanest people have the most simplest and charming names? Doesn't that mean pretty in Spanish? Well Linda was a bi*ch! She had a blank stare on her face, and refused to be friendly. I didn't want her to be my best friend but not my enemy either!

I could tell they were scared. The kind of scared where you're too damn old now to fight someone.

That's mine!  But she continued to hold the bag. Another customer waiting intervened and said,  Hey, you called her name. That's hers...  She gave me a dirty look like I was lying and reluctantly handed me my power bar. I snatched that bag out of her hand and shoved her right in her face. She fell down and started crying. I heard the crowd of customers gasp but it was too late. By then I was out for blood. I hopped over the counter and started going after Linda. I hoped she really new MMA because her ass was mine.
