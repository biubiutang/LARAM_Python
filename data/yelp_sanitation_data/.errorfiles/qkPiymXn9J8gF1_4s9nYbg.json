Price is very reasonable and most importantly, the service is great. I usually go either on a Saturday or Sunday morning, I always ask for my favorite waitress, Letty. She is quick, super friendly and great to all her customers.   Food is good. Again, you have to keep in mind this is a buffet and price is extremely reasonable. In my opinion, their buffet is much better than other breakfast buffets I've tired in town.

I am not a picky eater. I usually don't complain about food and I can usually adapt my taste buds to most anything. This shit, I just couldn't!!!!! The TEXAS BUFFET was even better than Aliante! I just honestly was all around disappointed! Most of the food was seriously room temp, not hot. Everything had pork in it. A lot of the stuff was dried out looking from not being touched or mixed. IDK, like I said, I rarely complain about food. I just can't get jiggy with the Aliante buffet! I usually give a place a second try but I wont be doing that with this one!", "Date": "2013-06-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Marvin", "ReviewID": "KCJlTpbkDKlXrluFO9v8ow", "Overall": "5", "Content": "You can't go wrong here for breakfast.

I don't eat breakfast foods but they had salami and pepperjack cheese cubes which I snacked on while waiting for them to uncover the lunch.   It's really close to the Nellis Air Force Base which we stay at whenever we got to vegas so we went twice.

As with any Vegas buffet, the quality of the food is a gamble, and not one you're very likely to win. Sadly, this one counts as a big loss.  Aside from the typical decor, it doesn't even feel like a restaurant. Plates and utensils are washed en masse, resulting in eating surfaces that look like they were simply sprayed with a hose and dipped in sanitation solution. In other words, everything looks dirty.  The food is awful. There's really no other way to put it. Looking at positive reviews, I can't for the life of me understand how anyone could eat this stuff with a smile. Maybe low prices are intoxicating their sense of judgment or they have the perfect combination of deadened taste buds and iron stomachs. The only other buffet I've been to that's worse than this one was at Sante Fe Station, and that one induced vomiting.  One can't help but shake the feeling this is the foods last chance at being served. Most of the options appear to be right at the borderline of expiration, or at least of the lowest quality. There are seven sections: BBQ, American, Asian, Italian, Mexican, Dessert and the Salad Bar. Don't even think about seafood, because there isn't any. I did my best to try a bit of everything, but it was tough finding anything appetizing from the Asian or Mexican areas. They don't even look right.  Meats are profoundly dry, akin to soft wood. Vegetables are fresher than anything, but the taste of the cooked ones manages to be awful as well. Fruit amounts to little more than watermelon. Meanwhile, you have a bountiful selection of breads. Great. And don't forget dessert. It rounds out the stomach cramps nicely. Though to be fair, they do have a gelato station that sticks out like a sore thumb in a place like this.  I can handle a bad meal as much as anyone, but this stuck with me the rest of the day, assaulting my stomach with night terrors. The single thing I can honestly say I enjoyed was a potato. I implore anyone with a mouth to go anywhere but this people trough. Even from a financial point of view, the food court will satisfy more for the same price.", "Date": "2011-07-25", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Alfred", "ReviewID": "ixjpOCNkONXCX_7yvih43A", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Five stars for the service, accommodation, friendly staff and food.

Their price is really cheap for the huge selection, everything tasted good. Their chicken mushroom alfredo was my favorite as you could really taste their mushroom sauce, their spaghetti marinara was really tasty, their chinese sesame balls were the best, just like dim sum but hot and tasty, in perfect shape even after sitting for a long time! Their fried gyoza dumplings were perfect, spiced just right, great asian flavor, even their spring rolls were great with tons of tasty meat. Their guacamole was fabulous and their ice cream was really smooth and delicious. Would definitely come back, the price is right, the atmosphere asian style and comfortable, I didn't want to leave.

They had $100 credit from the hotel, so the 6 of us decided to eat at this buffet. We went downstairs on a Tuesday night (two days before thanksgiving) & were relieved to find a rather short line and a big sign that said  HAWAIIAN NIGHT Every Tuesday!!!  Um, whoa! Sa-weeet!! Three of us are from Maui so we were super happy to see that sign.   We were seated promptly and our waitress was very sweet. Excellent customer service.   Now, we didn't expect the food to blow us away. You should never expect that from any buffet. Anyway, it was satisfying. Besides the  Hawaiian  Food (lechon - a whole roasted pig, kalbi ribs, haupia, etc), they had a Chinese bar, which was cool. They had steamed dumplings, yummy fried rice, sweet sour pork, etc. They also had a mexican bar with fajitas and enchilladas, and an Italian bar. Of course I focused on the Hawaiian food (which I was happy to see that they did NOT toss pineapple on random items and call it 'Hawaiian'). The food was satisfying but it doesn't reach the level of awesomeness that you can reach with the food in Hawaii. Duh.   The dessert bar was cool. Your usual pies, cake, cookies, fro-yo, and ice cream. An attendant scoops your ice cream for you and adds whatever type of toppings you want.   I think the buffet would have costed us $17.99 per person, which is honestly a little pricey for the quality of food. It wasn't terrible, but I am glad that it was free for us!", "Date": "2009-12-13", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "y3d57hrdEYbJBxTPtM8j9Q", "Overall": "5", "Content": "The Aliante has changed hands and the buffet is no longer managed by the Station chain and has changed it's name from 'Feast' to 'Medley'.  Definitely a change for the better!!  We tried the old Station buffet a couple times and decided not to go back.  The fall in the quality and selection in the offerings at the Cannery prompted us to try Aliante again.  Excellent quality, lunch is only $7.95 (!) and vast selection including a couple carving stations and a barbecue station that would be acceptable in a BBQ joint.  We always liked the look of the Aliante, now their food measures up, Try it!", "Date": "2012-11-30", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Erik", "ReviewID": "ywv0Yzb_VC0jUlKHfLUrcQ", "Overall": "2", "Content": "I've been to this buffet a couple of times previous when it was Station's Feast Buffet.  This was my first trip since the ownership changed.  This review is based upon a lunchtime visit.  The buffet was nice and clean and the wait staff were very friendly.  Now, for the food........  I'll start with what I thought was decent.  Most of the salad bar is just fine; there could be an expansion of the salad toppings and that would be a plus, but no real complaints here.  I did think the cold broccoli salad was pretty good.  Also, the selection of gelato is quite nice and tasty.  Now, for what definitely needs improvement:  The majority of the hot items are similar to what you would find in a high school cafeteria.  Seasoning is not in the cooking staff's vocabulary.  There are too many items that are deep fried and that just does not have a long holding time and hence the quality suffers.    All in all, I think I probably discarded 3 full plates of food that just wasn't worth eating.\  I still felt like I got my money's worth by taking a couple of trips through the cold salad bar and a number of plates from the dessert bar.", "Date": "2013-03-02", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
