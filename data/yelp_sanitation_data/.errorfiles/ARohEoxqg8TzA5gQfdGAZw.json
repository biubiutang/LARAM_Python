We had to wait a little for our chef to finish up at another table. Our server gave us free edamame appetizer for the wait which I thought was not necessary but I did appreciate him letting us know the reason for the wait. I ordered the Ocean Treasure (lobster, scallops, and shrimps), my husband got the Hibachi Tuna Steak, my mom got the hibachi chicken and my dad the filet mignon. The soup was really good and the salad fresh. We all enjoyed our meals and the friendliness of our lady chef. She was very engaging and not just concerned with her performance/show. Our server and assistant was very attentive. He was always refilling our drinks and asking if we need anything. Service was top notch! My seafood dish all tasted heavenly. Everything was cooked to perfection. My dad's filet was perfectly medium and my husband's ahi was perfectly seared. I tried the hubby's tuna and it was so flavorful and lovely. My mom did not finish her food (got full from the appetizer, soup, and salad) and had it to go. I tried it a couple of days later and it was still really good. The chicken and steak meal came with ice cream which was a good way to end a great experience. Oh and the Mango Lemonade was AWESOME!!! It also has free refills :-)  We enjoyed our time at this Benihana because of the extra care of our server and chef.

We were seated immediately, but it was over 30 minutes before the chef showed up to the table. An employee was having a large celebration that evening and 5 chefs were at the employee 's table. So even though we had reservations - the employee's table got service and we did not! Because they were so late to our table, we barely were able to eat our entree's, much less get our dessert or have the Birthday song sung to my daughter. We had to run out to make it to our show in time! This is not how you treat customers! This was very stressful for my daughter on a day that was supposed to be special. We spent a lot of money on tickets, airfare and hotel and instead of having a fun evening at Benihana's all we got was poor treatment and stress.

Then I ordered the Benihana Delight (chicken and shrimp) for my gf and the server asked how I would like it cooked...lol what?    Our chef came out and started preparing our food with so many slip ups and mistakes that it was hard to ignore. I've had a hibachi chef before who was barely 18 and he made less mistakes. As I looked around the room I noticed the other chefs were much more skilled so clearly we just got the short end of the stick.     The food was definitely the saving grace, everything was delicious, from the chicken fried rice to the scallops. However, my filet mignon was a little undercooked and bland.

One of my buddies got 12 oz steak and the other one order shrimp and scallop. Vinnie told us that they dont have combination shrimp and scallop only. It has calamari too. But she said she can replace the calamari with extra shrimp instead if it OK with us. The price will be cheaper than a la carte. Will do then. We also order 1 appetizer that she recommended  it's crispy tuna. Very delicious!! Don't missed the fried rice. It's so good!   We got our soup and salad, finish with our 2 rounds drinks also finish our appetizers. Where is the chef? Vinnie told us that the chef will be out soon but he didn't come. She knew that we were waiting. She offered us to order another drink while waiting and we did. Thanks to her that she didn't leave and let us wait with nothing. Excellent service!!

The portions are nice and generous and the atmosphere is festive.   Thurston is AMAZING. We love how he seasons everything and we love his humor and personality. He did an amazing job at making sure our night was a memorable one.   The one drawback to the location is that it isn't very well built for noise, and there's nothing on the walls to absorb some of the sound. It's not necessarily a ruckus, but it's just difficult to hear much farther than the person next to you from all the cooking and conversation. It's just this hum of commotion. We didn't necessarily mind it though.   Good food seasoned and cooked perfectly. Wonderful dessert. The prices are comparable to most other restaurants like it in town. For locals, the drive is a bit of a pain, but it's worth it. We tried Ohjah on Rainbow not too long ago. It was okay, but the food was a bit bland and the chef wasn't very personable.
