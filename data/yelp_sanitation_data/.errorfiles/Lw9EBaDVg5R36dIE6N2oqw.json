We had the most amazing Valentines dinner. My husband told me not to post a review about how incredibly delicious it was because then everyone in town will be eating there and it will get too crowded. Oh well, I'm writing the review anyways!  Chef Carlos Hernandez never dissapoints. He makes the juiciest tastiest burgers ever! Even the bun is perfection, it doesn't fall apart when loaded up with yummy toppings. The French fries are hot, and crisp with a light beer batter coating, also perfection. Pastas are good, the mussles are num num num. Now about last nights Valentines Dinner. It was a wine pairing and Chef Carlo NAILED it! Each wine was the perfect compliment to each course. We started with lobster bisque cappuccino. Served in a demitasse cup with a frothy head, it was about the best I've ever had. Smooth, rich and creamy with an intense lobster flavor, delicious. The salad was arrugula with pear slices, small blue cheese crumbles, and walnuts with a very light dressing. Soooo good. Our main course was filet mignon, topped with lobster tail, atop a bed of red bell pepper mashed potatoes with fingerling carrot and green been accompianments.  Everything was outstanding. Tender, flavorful meats, creamy mashers, all dente veggies, ooohhh lala. Dessert was a hot chocolate molten cake topped with berries. Ooozing with chocolaty goodness. Absolutely Devine. We also had the vanilla raspberry pannecota, it was wonderful.  To top it off, Chef Carlo greeted us when we arrived, and again took time at the end to come out and say thanks. Do your self a favor, and check this place out.  The also do catering for special events.  The only downside is occasionally they have a lesser experienced person serving tables.", "Date": "2014-02-15", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Lora", "ReviewID": "l4fuUkh3VgOFluERiquMyQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Very, very, very good!

It was kind of funny. At first I thought he was the chef since he was wearing a white chef jacket, but then he came up to us and said,  My name is Carlos and this is my kitchen.  He introduced himself AND explained the name of his restaurant.  I kept reading about how specials are posted on a board, but I couldn't find it at first and I didn't want to just get a regular sandwich or burger. I eventually noticed it behind the bar area and for today they had Enchiladas, a Southwestern burger, and a turkey ruben. I asked Carlos what was in the Southwestern burger and he said it had Pepper Jack Cheese,Roasted Peppers Grilled Onion, Lettuce,& Tomato with Chipotle Ranch. I was going to order it, but my mom jumped on that before I did, so I went with the Enchiladas. We both got iced tea that was always refilled once it hit the halfway mark.   While waiting, I took a look around the place. It's definitely Arizona Charlie themed, as Lucy E stated and it doesn't have the best ambiance. When we first walked in, we were greeted by a strong smell of smoke, but we just sat at one of the tables farthest from the bar area and it was fine. The furniture is pretty outdated with some old looking floral print fabric and our table cloth kept trying to fall off. Normally I would knock off some stars for that, but the food + service was outstanding. It seemed like everyone working at Charlie's Saloon was involved in the restaurant. The bartender in the saloon went up to us a few times to see how we were doing, gave us our menus when we just sat down, and asked how the Enchiladas were. When I told him they were great, he said,  That's what I'll be having for lunch. Everything in Carlos' Kitchen is amazing. You could probably throw a dart to pick anything on the menu and it'll come out awesome.  Before we even ordered the burger, Carlos said all their burgers are very good. You can tell that Carlos and everyone that works here is very proud of the food.   Carlos came out with our plates. The first thing I noticed was that the Enchilada plate looked a lot smaller than the ones you'd get at Mexican restaurants, but it was the perfect portion. Normally other places will just fill the plate with a bunch of sauce and watery beans, but this plate just had the two Enchiladas in the center and a small portion of beans and rice on the right and left. At first I thought the sauce was going to be overbearing because it looked like there was a lot of it, but it actually had a nice subtle flavor that complemented the Enchiladas perfectly. I'll be honest, I scraped my plate clean. I don't even remember the last time I ever did that, but I couldn't help it. The Enchilada plate was just so yummy and the portion was perfect. It didn't leave me overly full and I didn't have to waste any of it.  I took a bite of my mom's burger and it was good. The patty was very juicy and I actually really liked the Chipotle ranch that was inside. When I took a pic of the burger, it looked like there was A LOT of cheese in it, but the piece I ate didn't have any cheese on it, so I can't really comment on it ruining the burger (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/w3pRWx5xOnPmmuZL7c9Pvw/l.jpg). My favorite part about that dish was the beer battered french fries. They are soo long, so crisp, and perfectly breaded (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ie6f7x2-KBkbpdbxKJAuRA/l.jpg). I absolutely love their fries!  When we were done with our meals, Carlos talked to us for a while. He told us about how everything they make is from scratch including their soups. They always have a different soup and they just create it from whatever vegetable is in abundance at the grocery store or whatever is in season. He also told us about the New Years Eve Feast they're having for $20.12 (clever, right?). It includes: Mixed Greens with Poached Pears, Bleu Cheese and Champagne Vinaigrette, Grilled Filet Mignon topped with Two Sauteed Prawns, Eggnog Pannacotta with Brandy Caramel Sauce and fresh Whipped Cream. It's an awesome deal and it's served from 4pm-midnight.  Everything about our experience here today was excellent an I'll definitely be coming back to try out some more of their daily deals and definitely some of their soup!

It was date night time on a Friday so my husband and I had the pleasure of visiting this place. Chef Carlos came over and introduced himself and his staff before going into the kitchen and we were served the rest of the night by the sweetest waitress. I forgot her name but she was genuinely nice, not fake nice, and so sweet that I wanted to give her a hug and become BFFs. Moving on...  Looking at their menu, they have the standard bar fare, but alas, what is this? Goat cheese balls? Yes please. Breaded and fried goat cheese served with balsalmic vinegar and mango chutney for your choice of dipping and a mixed greens salad. They were delicious, creamy, gooey, and all other words associated with cheese. For my entree, I got the salad that had strawberries, walnuts, bleu cheese and chicken. All the ingredients were super fresh and blended very well together.   My husband got the spicy chicken sandwich which I stole several bites of. First off, the chicken was perfectly crispy and tender. The spicy sauce on it was not generic and surprisingly complex for a hot sauce. The bread. Oh the bread. I don't know what kind of bread they used but boy was it the perfect accompaniment. It did not ever get soggy, even at the end, and had the most fantastic chew to it. This was served with beer battered fries and when I tried one, I just had to order a basket because I knew my husband would get mad if I ate all of his.  The food here is undoubtedly stellar and the prices are fair considering the quality of the ingredients they use. I just wish it wasn't in a super smokey bar. My nose is pretty sensitive to smoke and I don't really want to smell that while I'm eating. I also wouldn't be able to bring my kids to this casual eatery because of its location. Regardless, I will be back for the food as my stomach is already craving the spicy chicken sandwich...", "Date": "2011-12-17", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ivan", "ReviewID": "G5jJWIa6gYVmjhP42UcaZQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Yummy Yummy.

I was aware of Chef Carlos when he was at the other place a few blocks away but never went there.  After being reminded of him by Susie H.'s recent review, this was on my to try list ASAP.  We arrived early last night (Sunday) after the Ribbon of Life show at the Smith Center.  We were the only ones in the place.  The server told us to sit anywhere we liked and she handed us the menus after we were seated.  Before leaving, she read the specials of the day.  There were two dinners, a wrap, and I believe a salad special.  She had me hooked with the first thing she read--bleu cheese pasta with steak!  I ordered that and my wife ordered Chicken Angelina.  The bleu cheese pasta was made with penne rigate and the steak was grilled, sliced, and placed in strips on top of the pasta.  The bleu cheese sauce was exceptional.  A great bleu cheese bite with every taste and there was extra bleu cheese crumbles spread on the pasta.  My wife chicken Angelina was a seared chicken breast served on top of garlic spinach and mashed potatoes with large pieces of mushroom.  It was topped with artichoke and there was a dijon cream sauce.  She enjoyed it a lot!  Although we were both full, we had our minds set on having dessert we had looked at online earlier in the day.  She got a chocolate molten lava cake and I got the chef's indulgence.  Both were outstanding!!!  The menu describes the indulgence this way:  A Cheesecake Spring Roll, Crunchy Bites of Brownie and Mini Banana's Foster Cheesecakes, served with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, Fresh Strawberries and House Made Berry, Caramel & Fudge Sauces.  For the single version there's one brownie bite and one mini bananas Foster, but that's more than enough.  There are sweetened tortilla strips on the bottom of the plate.  This is one of the most creative desserts I've seen.    Chef Carlos came to the table twice to check on us and we chatted about the food and what he'd done since he moved to this newer spot.  The restaurant is almost completely closed from the VP bar so there's almost no smoke smell from the bar coming into the restaurant.  I can really see this place coming onto our rotation list of places to go again and again.  I'll call and ask the specials before I go.  What a wonderful gem hidden away in this video poker bar!

The tomatoes have been peeled and marinated, the mozz has been re-created into a light mousse, and the hummus is served with an assortment of grilled vegetables kissed by a balsamic glaze.

Before our entrees showed up, Carlos came out from the kitchen and chatted with us for a bit.  We learned about the kind of food he likes to cook and his future ambitions to open a restaurant focused on unique fusion foods.   For my main course, I had the cheeseburger... I know that most of the time a cheeseburger is JUST a cheeseburger.  But, the bun on this one was toasted to perfection, toppings fresh, meat cooked just right... the fries were delicious (a little greasy though) AND the ranch is home made!  Other people in my party ordered the portobello mushroom sandwich , crispy chicken sandwich, crispy chicken wrap and the avocado burger (it was one of the daily specials). After we ate, Carlos came out again to ask us how everything was.  We topped the meal off with creme brulee.  It was not the best I've ever had (I'm not a huge fan in the first place), but pretty good.  It actually reminded me of flan for some reason.

The prior kitchen operator was OK for bar food. We had noticed that he (Carlos) had moved from Charlies months ago. I'm always a little Leary when there is a bio of the cook in the menu. Really? Just a little tacky.  We started out in the bar where the wife played $40 and had a coke, I had a beer and did not gamble. The place was empty except for the usual cast of bar flies speaking of past glories. The bartender (forget her name. Long blonde hair) served me a beer  (immediately returned to the 'regulars' and spoke on the bar phone extensively) $3.50 pricey for a draft Miller Lite and the server from the restaurant brought the wife her diet coke. The server knew the menu and specials. She was very prompt and attentive, sorry forgot her name also. Ordered the 'Hamburger special' in addition to the usual had spinach, mushrooms and Swiss. My wife ordered Nachos w/ shredded beef.   We moved into the dining room very nice, clean and complete with white table cloths. Now I understood why most items on the menu were $9.99 for lunch. After a short wait the food arrived. The burger (which I ordered medium) arrived well done with fries. It was OK, hard to mess up a burger except for being over cooked. Now the nachos were another story...Super thick/hard chips, some cheez whiz type stuff on the plate, a little (and I mean little) pica de giao (sp), a tiny drizzle of sour cream and a dab of guac on top of the (tough) shredded beef. No jalapenos, olives, re fried beans, real cheese melted on top nor salsa on the side. My wife had to ask for salsa.Terrible. (Great nachos are available at Bj's on E. Trop and Harmon or the Peppermill on the strip). It's hard to believe that a supposedly good cook cannot create a wonderful plate of nachos. (Just read his bio)  I guess the topper is that the Mrs was not even comped for her Coke after playing $40. How cheap is that. I was told that the bar and eatery were separate. Guess she should have had a shot of Jack or was told the 'rules' before ordering.  Needless to say we will not be back. The two stars are for the server, if not for her there would be no stars.

But even if the prices were double, the food would still easily be worth it. But I'm sure glad they aren't, as I'd be going broke soon enough.  A lot has been covered by reviews previous to mine. The atmosphere is odd, though separated enough that you can ignore the bar that offers little compared to the food on the table in front of you. I've had about half a dozen meals here now, and none of them have been short of outstanding.  If nothing else, the food is just simply perfectly cooked and seasoned. In particular, one of the specials, short ribs, is a dish you could easily pay upwards of thirty dollars for at a fine dining restaurant. And boy, is it just as good as all those other places. But not only is the meat good, even the vegetables are incredibly delicious. My mouth waters even thinking about how good that dish is.  I've also had a burger here. I'd actually recommend going for a main dinner special over it, but it's still excellent. Of particular excellence is the onion rings. I got them in lieu of fries in order to lower the calories of my meal, but the fact is they're so good it's worth it to get them anyways.  I've also had a pork chop special,chopped steak, a San Francisco melt sandwich, as well as the goat cheese cakes and the Chef's Indulgence dessert. The first time I got the goat cheese cakes, I was dumbfounded. It was the first item I had there, and it, no exaggeration, looked like a dish from a michelin-starred restaurant. The presentation was magnificent, and the cakes themselves were unbelievably textured and full of flavor.

That's why Carlos' Kitchen, after only one dining experience, very well could be my new favorite restaurant.  It's not an overly fancy joint located inside Spectators bar. In fact, Carlos explained to us (yes, he visited the table multiple times - more to come on that) that they used to be located inside of Charlie's Bar and had recently moved to this location. But the great thing is that the restaurant is separate from the bar and there wasn't a smokey smell in there - just a smell of amazing food.  So the service...we were greeted by Iris, a very knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive server. Absolutely awesome! She told us the specials, took our drink order, and throughout our entire meal was checking to see how we were enjoying the food and most importantly, kept our beverages filled!  Now to the food, there is good food, there is bad food, then there is Carlos' food. Prior to ordering Carlos came out and introduced himself to us, shook our hands, and wanted to find out how we heard about the restaurant. Of course we gave our Yelpsters props for correctly identifying this place as bomb-digity. He wanted to make sure we knew the specials then even told us how some of the items were prepared. He emphasized that he didn't cut any corners, everything is homemade. Literally errrthing is homemade. I ordered the Buffalo Chicken wrap. It was delicious, but very very spicy. The buffalo sauce was hot and spicy, but not in a bad way, in an addicting way. The blue cheese dressing in the wrap was also homemade and some of the best I've ever had. The french fries, which I'm sure were homemade as well, were amazing. As good as mine was, my wife was the  order winner  as she got the Asian burger special. Carlos used a ginger based Asian sauce that brought out so much flavor in the burger then topped it with Wasabi mayo and an Asian-slaw. I've had Fukuburger and Bachi Burger and both are awesome, but are second stringers compared to Carlos' creation. Maybe the best burger I've ever tasted. And for the grand finale we ordered the lava cake. Absolutely the best I've had. Carlos told us that the secret was that he used Belgian chocolate. He also makes his owned whipped cream.  Carlos came out and checked on us mid-way through our meal to see how we liked everything. I almost gave him a standing ovation right then and there. He then checked on us one more time before we left and thanked us for our business. As the owner and executive chef I certainly wouldn't expect this kind of attention, but I really appreciated it. Both my wife and I really enjoyed chatting with him. I hope Carlos' Kitchen thrives in it's new location. Anyone who is that genuine about the food coming out of their kitchen deserves the utmost success.

After reading rave reviews on Yelp and passing by several times in the past few months, I gave in this morning to my hubby's persistence and decided it was time to give this place a try.  I am one of those people who believe that environment reflects quality.  If that were true, this place should be filled with frozen food out of a box and canned sauces.  After all, being in a 24/7 bar doesn't scream awesomeness up front.   I am now ready to apologize for even thinking that way, especially after trying the food here.  It's a breath of fresh air, or, in this case, a spoonful of great tastes.  I love the fact that it's odd and the food is a total contrast to the setting.  I also love the fact that the chef loves his food and patrons so much that he says hello personally to all his patrons.  It's the small things that make this place a hidden gem.  When you first drive up you see this empty sign on the front wall and then walking through the front doors you see this dark bar with poker machines on the counters, then this small restaurant seating area to the left.  There's a sign with the menu posted, but no host podium, so you stand there and wonder,  should I just sit, or wait for someone?   Sure enough they read your mind and the nicest server comes to seat you anywhere you wish.    I tucked myself in to a white cloth-covered booth that was a bit interesting to me.  I've never seen cabinet liners (they prevent the table cover from slipping) under a tablecloth before.  That's actually pretty clever, but odd once again.  The chairs have those floral pillows on them, the backings of the booths are the same pattern, then there's the decor on the wall of tiny copper pots and pans.  You do see frames filled with articles of praise for this place, which is nice to read while you wait to place your order (and the wait isn't long at all).  The menu is simple.  Simple is good.  I hate having 14 pages to sift through, ten types of meats to think of with fourteen side dishes to choose.  Chef Carlos pairs everything well so you don't have to think.  All you have to do is order what you want.  With the small menu it's easy.  There are a few specials if you're in the mood to try something other than the usual dishes, and I suggest that you do.  My first meal ever at this restaurant is the portobello sandwich with grilled red onions, mixed greens, jack cheese, and bell pepper.  It's served on a hoagie roll with fresh french fries.  The edges were just the right crispiness and the mushrooms could convert you to vegetarian.  It's meaty, flavorful, and done well.  Sometimes veggie sammies are wet and the bread gets soggy, but the bread was yummy and stayed perfect the whole meal.  I even tried my hubby's Greek burger (the special) and it was fantastic.  The meat is seasoned perfectly, and every topping compliments each other and isn't overwhelming.  As for the fries, they are delicious and crispy.  We even had onion rings, and they're fantastic.  When menus say  beer battered  you order them craving that beer taste only to be left wanting, but these onion rings have that flavor well pronounced.  The crispy batter sticks, even when cutting them down with a fork, and that's something that hardly happens for me when I eat onion rings anywhere.    In the end I had to try one dessert, so I ordered the lava cake, which I craved after watching Master Chef the other night (it was their cooking challenge dish).  His lava cake was creamy, warm, and had that perfectly baked crunch edge on the outside that I love.  Although not served with ice cream, the sauces braided around it was a lovely touch and the whipped cream was nice, too.    We loved it so much that four hours later we came back to eat dinner.  I have to say that the food that evening was just as spectacular. I could rave on about both meals, but all you need to  know is that it is worth a try.  Don't be afraid of the atmosphere or location because that doesn't matter.  What matters is that this man, this brilliant man with over 2 decades of serious hotel, restaurant, catering and teaching at Cordon Bleu experience offers us locals a chance to eat beautiful, filling, yummy food without the need to fork out a mortgage payment or slip on a tiny black dress or suit and tie.  This man doesn't need the velvet seats or fancy bottled water.  All he needs is a place to be creative, to do what he loves without restraint, and to create happy accidents like the cheesecake spring rolls.    Give this place a try and I promise you that you will walk out happily surprised and satisfied that you found a hidden gem in the most unlikely of places.  I know I walked out so excited that I came back for dinner the same day.  I plan to eat my way through his entire menu.

I don't know about anyone else, but I hate going to an overcrowded bar, especially during events like the Super Bowl.  Last year, I ended up going to a PT's and there was an annoying drunk that blew into a trumpet every chance he got.  I don't mind the loudness in a bar (it adds to the excitement of the game), but stuff like that is just a annoying in my opinion.  Needless to say, this year Jade and I were in search of a bar that met our criteria: 1:  Good Super Bowl deals on drinks and food 2:  A place that wasn't overly crowded It's a pretty simple list and we ended up at the best place, which I'm sure we will be frequenting during every Super Bowl.... Carlos' Kitchen.  If you've never heard of this place, you definitely got to check it out.  Not only did they have a killer Super Bowl deal, there was plenty of seating available and the service was amazing.  It's locally owned/operated and Carlos himself even came by our table a few times during the night to see how everything was.  Here is the deal: BIG SCREEN in the Dining Room and screens available throughout the Bar area All-You-Care-To-Eat Buffet for $10.00   Hamburger Sliders, Mini Spicy Chicken Sandwiches, Chips and Salsa  BATTLE of the CHOWDERS: Manhattan v. New England!! In honor of the New York Giants:   NY Style Pizza   Hot Dogs In honor of the New England Patriots:    Shrimp Cakes   Fresh Mussels   Their full menu was also available for the night.   Also, Charlie's (this is where Carlos' Kitchen is located.. inside Charlie's) offered Happy Hour Drinks $1.00 Domestic Draft (Bud, Bud Light, Miller Light) & $2.00 Well Drinks  Pros: * The food was awesome for the price!   We were a huge fan of the homemade pizza .  The chips and Salsa was also amazing! * Incredible service.  Like I mentioned above, Carlos himself even came by to check on us. * Spacious seating and the atmosphere was NOT a blanket of cigarette smoke  Cons: * N/A   I really can't think of any negatives.   Overall:    This is definitely a place to check out during Super Bowl for the upcoming years.   They had some pretty good finger foods and good deals on drinks too!  As you can see with how they arranged the special Super Bowl menu, they definitely had some Super Bowl spirit!  Awesome Super Bowl deals and incredible service... I'll definitely be back.  Highly recommended!   Tips: *  Carlos' Kitchen is inside Charlie's Saloon  *  They have an App that can be downloaded for specials  * Add Carlos' Kitchen to FaceBook for more specials.\", "Date": "2012-02-07", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Troy", "ReviewID": "dPr0iKPsG-PXnjFgV1JxEQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Friday, dinner hour.

We sat there for a few minutes and then realized that it was likely no one would help us unless we flagged them down so my friend went and told the bar tender (the dining area is seperate from the bar) that we were there.   A nice older lady helped us. The only reason I note that she is older is that she clearly had a hard time hearing our orders, and due to her difficulty she missed that my friend ordered a  chicken ceasar salad  and only heard the ceasar salad part... when she brought out his order and it was pointed out to her she said she could get the chicken but it would take awhile.   As to the food - Carlos came out and greeted us. I notified him that we had not been there before and asked for recommendations. He said that the specials of the day were always good. Today it was chicken parmagian and a greek feta burger, he touted that the burger was wonderful and clearly the way to go. He described the 85/15 fat percentage of the angus beef and the brioche bun. Taking his recommendation this is what I ordered - medium rare.   The burger was somewhere in between a medium rare and a medium. It was quite large and came with french fries. The cost was $10.99, a little hefty for a burger from a bar and not a  burger bar . The bun was great, buttery and did not become soggy. It stood up well to the burger. The patty was what you would expect for homemade. However, the toppings weren't what I thought I just didn't truly get the mediterranean flavor profile I was expecting. There seemed to be a lot of wilted greens, what I believe was spinach, and the flavor of the greens overpowered the delicate flavor of feta. The french fries were frozen but they were crispy and fine, more like pub fries, nothing outstanding but nothing bad either. I ordered a side of ranch for the fries - the ranch was house made although it had an odd flavor I can't even describe it, clearly it was some house seasoning that I am not used to in ranch. And my big pet peeve they didn't tell us and they charged $.50 for ranch. I could see charging for ranch or other dressing if a patron was abusing it, but with the up charge for burgers etc. and they can' t fork out a few pennies for a side of ranch is just unacceptable to me and then if you are going to charge at least have the decency to notify me ahead of time. I know  you are saying it's just 50 cents, but truly it is the principle of the matter to me.  Also, there was one other couple that walked in shortly after us but we put our order in first. We arrived at 12:10, put our order in around 12:20 and it took about half an hour for our food. For fresh cooked, and the fact that Carlos was probably the only one in the kitchen, I understand but I only note this as if you are on your lunch hour and looking for a quick bite based on service and the length to get your food this might not be your best bet.   Another friend got the nachos. I had one. It was good, chips fried from flour tortillas. However, even thought it was the appetizer size it was a lot smaller than I had anticipated and my friend was not full upon leaving.  On the upside they had fresh brewed ice tea ($2.00) but I didn't get that many refills as due to the lack of service I had to flag someone down for a refill and then later she came back once to refill again. Yes three teas may be plenty for some, but they were smaller glasses which were filled with ice (which is fine) but servers should be attentive to empty drink glasses to provide prompt refills, especially when there are only two tables.

This is one of the best meals we had while in Vegas, regardless of the price. The food is very well prepared and presented, the service is quick and friendly. Once your food is served, the owner/chef, makes his way to your table to make sure that your food is as expected.

Not to say you can't get a genuine feel for a place after 1 visit, more like there are so many places I frequent that I haven't reviewed and I feel those fully-realized thoughts would be more beneficial to Yelp readers.  But upon leaving Carlos' Kitchen, after just 1 visit, I felt compelled to chime in and share this gem with locals sooner rather than later.  One of the reasons I feel comfortable reviewing Carlos' is that every other positive review of this place is already spot-on.  YES, Carlos was there and came to visit my table (at 9:30pm on a weekday, despite an otherwise empty dining room) - a classy, genteel, respectful move if there ever was one in the restaurant biz.  YES, my food was hot to order, well presented, plentiful, and above all, delicious.  YES, there is always multiple specials of the day, your server will describe them in precise detail, and it won't be a scam like Cream of Yesterday's Entree Soup. YES, the place is a poker bar with scant distance from the smokey bar to the seating area, but once the food starts landing all that melts away.  And YES, the prices are far more reasonable than they have any business being (Hot app, sandwich, special-of-the-day dinner salad, and 2 soft drinks came in under $40, even after tax/tip,).    So what else do I want to add to this conversation that hasn't already been said?  Thanks for asking, I'll tell you...  Carlos' Kitchen looks like a Timbers, a PT's, a Lodge, an Outside Inn, a Sierra Gold, a Bilbo's, both inside and out.  The difference, the reason you should choose to eat here versus all those other close, fast & convenient options, is because Carlos is a dedicated chef and absolutely yearns to make you happy.  Without putting words into his mouth, he's crafted these dishes and prepares them for you because he wants people to eat better food, and there's more than one way to accomplish that goal besides being a 5-star Strip restaurant (which he could totally do if he wanted,). The easiest way for Carlos to reach the masses, or just to simply make one person's day better with a good meal, is to serve pub grub next to a video poker machine and do it better than anyone else in the neighborhood.  These types of restaurants used to be the norm, and they can be again if Vegas makes the concerted effort to drive past TGI Friday's and Red Lobster and support the guy who got up that morning intent on making their day better through nachos, burgers, and chocolate cake.", "Date": "2012-06-26", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Sarah", "ReviewID": "u4FOBXgCve0cMh0mw0kH9Q", "Overall": "5", "Content": "What a great meal. :) I've read the reviews, been anticipating a visit, and was not disappointed.

It was accompanied by some delicious fries that were both light and crispy.

The food is so good for the price that if I were one of those who could afford to eat at a Wolfgang's or other Vegas strip profile eatery very week, I'd go to Carlos' instead and leave giant tips. I feel comfortable there-- no gourmet snobs giving me the  he's not hip  glances; but even if you order a more familiar dish, the quality always proves you HAVE found food you aren't used to.... unless you're used to paying more.  You will probably have trouble choosing a favorite dish. These are CHEFS. They're real pros that do everything well, not just one sauce or bread handed down from a forgotten talented relative. If forced to choose, I would ask Carlos if he has the ingredients to make his amazing  Greek burger . You'll be thinking about that  one long after you eat it. It's too bad people like  Susy Y  have to pretend they are pro food critics when their observational skills are so poor (a male employee sleeping there??), then visit the one night (I've ever heard of) the door being open between the dining room and bar. Which reminds me (there's so much she got wrong), it is NOT a bar burger, just because a bar is attached to the room and the food can go to the bar. And I highly doubt yet another very young, typically posturing hipster-pseudo-intellectual could tell the difference between medium rare and medium, being that's somewhat relative anyway... Yet she went ahead and wrote it about it of course, yet guessed at what is obviously sautéed spinach, which I would HOPE isn't sharing even strength with the feta. Have an opinion, but please see life from more years, highs and lows before posing as someone who knows food. When a city like vegas has most people whipping by to get to the nearest McDonald's, it's no wonder guys like Carlos have to struggle with finding a location and the amount of help to start. I could see that challenge a mile away... so I was surprised when the food was that good (just check out other reviews) and the service was that good. Clearly if someone had a problem with Carlos' it would be an off-night (nobody's perfect) or a review from an over- privileged punk.", "Date": "2013-08-15", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Vegas Craaa", "ReviewID": "FcjUFc0KDQMJ5M0gMqXlAw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "This place is well hidden gem on the west side of town.

Im sorry.   Every other aspect of my experience of Carlos's Kitchen was outstanding. The service was above par with a young tattoo'ed lady (sorry i forgot your name) that was very sweet and attentive. Just like others mentioned Carlos himself came from the kitchen to introduce himself and offer some feedback on the menu and looking for feedback as well from his customers which i found very refreshing. And the food itself....   Chicken nachos on recommendation of Yelpsters was pretty damn tasty with the seasoned chicken, but the highlight for me was the huge clump of fresh guac on the top and the fresh salsa on the side. That guac was solid.   There was a seafood pasta (forgot the fancy name) that was on the specials board for the day. Had a heavy portions of mussels, shrimp, in a red sauce served with spaghetti that was so good. The fresh garlic slivers and fresh ingredients really shined with dish. Even the damn garlic bread was that good with fresh garlic, but i am a sucker for dough.   The BBQ burger was good but i made a mistake by ordering it. Ill be honest i was disappointed after trying the pasta that i had ordered  just a burger . It was cooked well with an onion ring inside and the BBQ sauce combo that gave it great flavor but id say that its a hamburger but a good one. The fries were very tasty and not what i expected as they were larger style steak fries which are usually not too crispy but these were which i love.   Dessert was the platter that came with cheesecake egg roll, warm brownie bite, and another cheese cake bite. All of which was excellent but i think next time ill go for one larger dessert to enjoy rather than just bites like a sampler style situation.   All in all the food, service, and people were all very positives notes as the simple thought behind serving people good food, with good service, and a smile will always do well is true here. My only suggestion would be to order one of the specials rather than  just a burger  although the burger is good i always feel like i can replicate it at home and i cant with some of the other food that may be served here by Carlos so take advantage of his skills and let him serve you up something proper.

So it lacks the hearty bite of a great Reuben, more like a  Hot Pocket  consistency.

Anyway, after much review reading from Yelp, the fiance and I decided to give it a shot, as we were tired of all the Asian food we eat. :)  Atmosphere and decor is alright. It's not too fitting since it's attached to a bar. The restaurant isn't too big, and it wasn't incredibly busy either.  Our servers name was Iris, a very nice lady who seemed very knowledgeable about the menu and how the items were prepared. She was the only server working though, and it showed, She was very busy with the 7 tables at once and we overheard her apologize to every table about their waits. We had to wait awhile to order, however we did not mind too much.  Fast forward to the food. For our appetizer, we ordered the beef nachos. It was pretty disappointing. I appreciate that the chips are fried to order, however it seemed very unnecessary. We had very little toppings, a few scraps of meat, and the cheese was glued to all the chips. It wasn't too  stringy , it just seemed like the dish was sitting under the heat lamp too long.   Our entrees were alright too. I had the crispy chicken sandwich w/fries and a broccoli cream soup. The chicken wasn't as crispy, and the buffalo sauce seemed a bit off. The soup was bland however the presentation was beautiful. The fries are AMAZING. My fiance ordered the Chicken Angelina, a chicken breast in garlic-spinach mashed potatoes with dijon mustard sauce. It was pretty decent, no complaints.   The service was a little slow, and the chef came out and spoke to everyone about their meals and asked how everything was. It was very neat to see a chef come out and greet the customers, one of the reasons why this is a three star review.  Overall, we appreciate the effort of the chef.

I ate myself stupid - meal, drink, dessert & coffee - for $17 + tip. Plus, I got to watch the Olympics as I sat at the bar with 4-star quality food.  Ok, so the restaurant's situated in a bar. About 1/3rd of the bar is restaurant-style sit-down, but since it was 4:30 and I was by myself for this particular adventure, I just sat at the bar and enjoyed the $1 draft happy hour. The menu specials change daily and they're totally at odds with the surroundings (who would consider Bourbon Glazed Grilled Salmon and Creme Brulee standard fare at a sports bar?? I digress...). Either way, if you're debating a trip over, you can check the specials and menu on the website above.  So, Carlos himself came over to talk to me about the menu and I mentioned Yelp (to which he said,  They've been very good to me. ) and asked about the chicken nachos that have been raved about by many. He informed me that, in addition to the chicken nachos that get all the attention, he has shredded beef nachos that are equally as good. I decided to take his advice and tried them. Conclusion: HOLY SH!T, THESE ARE GOOD!   *Nachos, Deconstructed* The Base - Chips and Cheese:  - The chips are obviously fresh-fried and crispy throughout (no soggies, even toward the middle, at the end of my food-fest).  -  Mo' Cheese, Mo' Better  seems to be the guiding principle here and it's melted perfectly (no stray non-melties and it isn't cooked so much that it's browned or crunchy). If you're like me and delight in just melting a pile of cheese on a plate to pick at as a snack, then you'll be happy. If you think I'm gross, well... that sucks. Veggies: - Consisted mainly of green onions, pico de gallo and tomatoes. Not too heavy on 'em and balanced in flavor. - Guacamole - I know, avocado's a fruit, so sue me. There was a big, ice cream scoop-sized lump of it resting on top of the pile of nachos. Holy Flying Spaghetti Monster, it was great. Nice and creamy, without the bitterness you get with so many other guac's. I dug it. Beef: - Juicy, tangy, melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness. I would have seriously just been happy with a plate of the stuff.  Accessorize: The whole pile was drizzled with sour cream and either queso fresco or panela cheese.   For dessert, there's a Chef's Indulgence (which consists of 3 or 4 different desserts and was tempting, despite being alone and already pretty full), but I decided on Creme Brulee and a cup of coffee. The creme brulee was on par with the nachos - made from scratch, perfectly done and just the right texture. I had done away with decorum at about nacho #4, so I just continued on that tack by using my finger to scrape out the remainders of the custard in the bottom of the ramekin (that's the beauty of it being in a dark bar - nobody even looked sideways at my piggish ways).   Excellent meal with excellent company (I talked with Carlos for nearly 20 minutes as I ate). In addition to the food, he told me he offers cooking demonstrations on Saturdays, which sounds like something fun to do. He's obviously well-rounded in his experience and after chatting with him, found out that he's been all over the country cooking for restaurants and four-star hotels, in addition to cooking his way through Germany (hence the spaetzle special that pops up from time to time), Italy, France and Luxembourg.
