Only my boyfriend and I ate - but we bought four meals and a side. I wanted to try everything! I got a Swedish meatball plate, a salmon plate, chicken finger plate, caesar salad, and a side of mac and cheese. My favorite dish was the chicken fingers and if I wanted to eat that style of food I would go to Raising Cane's because they do it better.  The Swedish meatballs tasted like regular meatballs and the salmon and salad was  meh.  The mac and cheese were surprisingly good and a decent portion considering it was only a side. Still, I wouldn't wait in line for it. If you get a soda they give a tiny glass - no to go options here. The glass reflects how big I would expect them to be in a parody of a Swedish restaurant.   Nothing was bad, but in my humble opinion only worth trying once. Even if I was shopping at Ikea I would rather pick up food on the way home than eat here again. That said, I have not had breakfast which I hear is good so maybe I'll come back around for that experience.", "Date": "2016-08-29", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Cindy", "ReviewID": "JEQwy-iUetti0DDsYuwQUA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I finally got to visit IKEA. The crowds have died down and I parked fairly close (Maybe because it was storming that day, and I then figured since I was nearby and wanted to wait out the rain, it would be a good time to go.). IKEA is pretty much the same from my experience with it many years ago. I'm used to the concept and glad they kept it. The service was pretty good and friendly. I mainly was doing window shopping and really was there to get the meatballs. They're still good and haven't changed. The mash potatoes weren't bad.  I also tried this vegetable cake, which was good. Their apple pie, on the other hand, was just OK. The cafeteria is fairly big, airy and clean, I see they expanded on this concept, probably because of their famous meatballs. The food was priced reasonably at around $4 for a plate of meatballs, etc. I also saw a sign for $1 breakfast...cheapest in town!.

We bought the tickets when they first mentioned this event in the Review Journal.  With the Ikea family card, it's only $12.99 per person.  A good deal for those who wants to explore their menu items. They had Prinskorv sausages, herring, poached and smoke salmon, Swedish meatballs, assorted cheeses, salads, crispbread, and plenty of dessert items.  Soft drinks, coffee, and tea were also included in the price.  For the price, the food was good.  The best tasting item to me was their smoked salmon. Their hot food items would have been better if it was keep in warming trays but besides that I have no complaints.  Although the line up was long, the wait was worth it.  Their dessert items were also good.  We tried their chocolate cake, almond cake, a pistachio dessert and other items that we didn't know the name of.

I'm guilty of going to IKEA just about every week. I love IKEA so much that when my birthday came along.. they got me a IKEA meatball cake. It was a dream come true seriously!  My first stop is ALWAYS here in the food court.  I've been here the first week it opened a couple months ago, a couple days after, that weekend after that and etc. up until last week. It's improved honestly. There is no longer a 30+ minutes just to wait some more in the real line for food. They also put those cute IKEA flags if you get multiple sides of meat.  Chicken meatballs over veggie meatballs over Swedish meatballs That probably doesn't make any sense but.. the more I've eaten the Swedish meatballs, the more I develop a distaste for them. Veggie meatballs are pretty decent. The chicken meatballs are my shizz.  I used to enjoy the veggie medallions... a little too much if ya ask me. Back story: I thought I loved them so much that I decided to order 3. Big mistake! I couldn't finish and haven't ate one since...  The sides are mediocre to decent.  All their desserts are super sweet. If you're okay with that, ya gotta try them ALL.  They have a super cheap ($1) breakfast meal that I would totally recommend if you're in the area in the morning.  Basically, the chicken meatballs with gravy and the almond cake with butterscotch/chocolate give me life. It feels like the first time every time I eat them.   After you've eaten everything (including all your feelings), it's the perfect time to walk/browse/shop for the next 374728 hours.   They also have cinnamons buns, pizza, frozen yogurt and candy calling your name at the end. ;)  Quick tips: If you're a coffee drinker, use your rewards card for a free cup.  Not a big fan of veggies. Get sides of meatballs instead. You'll save some pennies that way plus they add the cutest Swedish flag on toothpick that you'll ever lay your eyes on.  They also have random smorgasbord/event every month from what I've noticed.

I finally got a chance to visit earlier this week and I was not sure if I was more excited about the furniture or the food. #foodieproblems  I have been to a handful of Ikea's and I really enjoy their food. During this trip, I already ate lunch but decided to share a meatball plate. The line moved quickly as I pushed my tray cart next to the case filled with dessert. Choosing dessert before an entree? That's my kind of meal. I barely had the chance to check out my options, so I grabbed this pink circle thing. When you arrive at the hot food counter, you tell the server what you want and they put your choices on a plate. The meatball plate has 8 Swedish meatballs topped with gravy, a scoop of mashed potatoes, a little scoop of lingonberry jam, and a side of veggies. I passed on dry looking veggies, so I asked if I could substitute for mac & cheese. They are completely fine with substitutions, which is always nice to know. There is a little display in the middle that has bread, salad, and salad. You grab an empty glass or mug and pay for it before you can fill it up your choice of soda or coffee. I opted for a can of their apple cider and went to the cashier to pay.   The meatballs were great, just like how I remembered them. The pink dessert I picked up was better than I could of imagined. I had to google it for the name, but it is a cream cake with marzipan. The cake was light and fluffy. Even though they didn't have the Daim torte, all was forgiven because this little pink dome of deliciousness was well worth every calorie.  With your Ikea family card, you get free coffee or tea on your visit! It's just way too hot to even think about that when its 110 degrees outside. The espresso machine did look pretty tempting though.   Overall, what can you really say about a food in a furniture store? Their main product is furniture, the food is more of a snack when you're deciding what color sofa you want. The current rating of 3 stars is not giving Ikea the respect those meatballs deserve. If you are coming here to get a fancy dinner then obviously you are going to be disappointed.   Btw the mini market downstairs by the exit has all sorts of Ikea food that you can take home to eat. Bars of chocolate and frozen  items to creat a Swedish feast on your newly put together dining table.   Protip: Grab a bag of frozen meatballs and pair it with some rice. Bomb!

My favorite item is their Smoked Salmon. Their Smoked Salmon is one of the best I've had. So if your at Ikea and in the mood for Salmon bypass their baked Salmon and go straight for their Smoked Salmon with vegetables in their cold case. You will not regret it.   Another favorite I had was their Swedish Meatballs. Probably ate a dozen of those. lol Don't forget dessert! The Chocolate Conspiracy Cake is my favorite. All of their cakes are good. Trust me I tried them all! lol  As of this date (6/26/16) the Ikea Food Court only has a rating of two stars on Yelp which I feel is under rated. I would give this place 3 1/2 stars. Place is clean.

I love how affordability and quality are hand in hand  in the food court. Great variety of food for kids too. There's free American coffee for members but I always get the latte or cappuccino since it's just $1.50!!! The machine is not the usual one you see in other public places. It's not powdered milk with fattening other ingredients and coffee is ground on top of the machine and UTZ certified. The small box next to it is a mini or should say tiny fridge with a fresh gallon of milk plus back up. I saw it with my own eyes when milk ran out on me and they had to change it. (Lucky me lol) There are low tables, lounge area and high tables with stools too. You choose :) Staff on the floor are helpful and constantly maintaining and assuring the cleanliness of the place. It's self service so in the end you should drop your tray to appropriate station.  The food court is spacious and modern with floor to ceiling windows facing the mountain view of SW.

Sadly I was one who waited 45 mins one time :) Luckily people are not flocking all together now, the flow is better. This review is solely for the food court btw. They open 30 mins prior the store opening at 10 am. You should try their salmon lox for breakfast, delicious juice boxes and not to forget the sweets!! Oh and they have gluten free desserts to which I'm so happy about!  Ikea your amazing!!!!

There were some grab and go items such as salad and salmon in a refrigerated case next to the desserts, but I skipped that. The hot food is served to you, cafeteria style. You just let the ladies know what you want and they slop everything on a plate for you. Besides meatballs they had pasta, chicken fingers, and fish. The Swedish meatball plate is priced at $4.75 and includes 8 balls, a scoop of mashed potatoes, veggies, cream sauce and ligonberry jam. After you get food you pay and seat yourself.

However, I just had a poor experience. We met at the food court/restaurant with our kids and some friends on Thursday night, and saw an ad for the  families eat free  event coming up this weekend. The idea was, if you eat at the food court over the weekend, you could deduct the price of your meal from a furniture purchase. That sounded great, so my wife and I decided to come back on Saturday for lunch and to buy our daughter a new dresser.   On Saturday, we loaded our kids in the car and headed over to Ikea at lunch time. It was super-busy, but we waited in line (basically a line before choosing your food in the actual line) for about 20-30 minutes. When we got to the front of the line, we saw a piece of computer paper with the message  please note: ikea of Las Vegas is not participating in the 'Families eat free' promotion   After seeing this, we got out of line and bought our daughter the $250 dresser (she needed one desperately and we didn't feel up for taking a big shopping trip in the summer weather).   So everything was  fine , and I don't think that the store intentionally set up a bait and switch, but I do feel a little put out that they left the promotional material up on-site leading up to the dates of the event, but waited until the day of the event to declare that they weren't participating.   I can't pretend to know more about running a business than the owners of this IKEA, but I will say that today's experience has eroded a lot of the excitement I initially felt about the store opening. It's petty of me, but I'm going to do my best to find some reasonably priced desks someplace else next month when we are doing our back to school shopping.   Fwiw- the ikea website shows a list of similar promotions and includes stores that have opted out. As of today (July 2nd), it shows that the Las Vegas store has opted out of the  kids eat free  promo, but it does not mention Las Vegas as having opted out of this family promo.", "Date": "2016-07-03", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "N", "ReviewID": "JwTVY-PctvNj1FQHYGZAww", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Trying the famous Swedish meatballs AKA Kottbullar today at IKEA!!

I have no reason why, but I just did.  So a place like IKEA...with a cafeteria of Swedish delights?  I.  Am.  In.  I have eaten all kinds of stuff, from the fancy gourmet go to dinner in a dress shirt to the high-end all-you-can-stuff-yourself-silly with king crab legs buffet, down to the home-cooked dine in shorts & slippers to the $4.99 for breakfast buffet.  Hell, I've even been known to go to McDonald's on occasion!  Point is, I have no problem stuffing my face with Swedish 'cafeteria' food.  Show me the plastic trays!  Thankfully, the IKEA cafeteria is really like an actual cafeteria.  Grab yourself an actual rectangular plastic tray at the beginning of the line, then mosey on down to fill that thing up with plates upon plates of Swedish Americanized food!  It's funny how the line starts off with desserts, then appetizers/snacks, on to the main food line, then ends with the soup/salad bar before heading to the cashier.  Either way, it's a practice in efficiency.  Did it help that we actually went on opening weekend?  NOPE.  Line was hella long, took us nearly 45 minutes to get through!  Did it help that we went again a few weekends later when IKEA was doing their family promo - buy $100 worth of IKEA home furnishings and your entire family gets to eat for FREE!  NOPE.  We spent at least a good 30 minutes in line waiting for food!  That family eats for free weekend promo was something we really took advantage of.  Of course with this promo, ALL food had to be consumed on premises.  No take-out or to-go allowed.  But...does that stop me from bringing a Ziploc bag and putting any leftovers into my wife's purse?  NOPE.  The fam & I ate like IKEA KINGS on this day - I say we easily purchased nearly $50 worth of food from the cafeteria...to feed only 3 people!  HA!  We had a sampling of a lot of the IKEA menu - Swedish meatballs (duh) with lingonberries, veggies & mashed potatoes, BBQ chicken wrap, salmon wrap, chicken fingers with fries, and even a few desserts like some sort of torte & a slice of apple cake.  All washed down with cups of coffee and glasses of lingonberry drink!  Get yourself an IKEA FAMILY card, signing up is free.  One of the benefits is free coffee at the cafeteria.  Is the food the best?  NOPE NOPE NOPE.  Their Ranch dressing kinda sucks too.  But come on, what do you expect from commercial chicken fingers and meatballs that come out of bags?  Gourmet it is NOT.  But I somehow, someway find it tasty.  Yes!  Blah, blah, blah all you haters & foodies.  If the zombie apocalypse comes and your fancy restaurants & froo-froo coffee drinks get taken away, I'll be able to survive off of dog food & a buck knife!  The rest of you will probably end up being chow for a hungry walker.  But for us, it was totally worth eating at the IKEA cafeteria for FREE during their promo!  I mean, we were gonna spend at least $100 on curtains & other home junk we probably didn't need anyway.  Why not get something out of it?  I got a stuffed tummy, and a book of semi-Swedish instructions on how to put together some window paneling.  Win overall.  Will I be back to the IKEA cafeteria?  You BETCHA.  Hell, I'd be back to the IKEA cafeteria on a weekly basis just for breakfast.  For $1 (yes a BUCK) you get a plate of scrambled eggs, turkey sausage links & breakfast potatoes.  Plus IKEA FAMILY members still get that free cup of coffee!  Beat that, you places that serve your $1 breakfast 'burritos'.

One of the things that they need to improve on are the attitudes of their servers. These are the people who give you your food after you have selected it. Majority of them look like they do not want to be there nor do they have the energy to say  Hi  or smile at their patrons. It's as if we, the patrons, need to be the ones to strike up a greeting or a conversation. The cash register people too, have the same attitude. They need to be re-trained to provide good customer service and have the right attitude to accommodate their patrons. This is still one of the services that consumers look for in an establishment.  The Swedish meat balls with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies are great, not to mention their $1.00 breakfast promo. We periodically come here on the weekends after morning runs to eat. You get free coffee if you're an Ikea family member (you get a card).  Today we tried their Salmon with steamed veggies and side of potatoes and it was very good. Satisfied.

The portion sizes are perfect for small people or people dieting.... but at least they are reasonably priced. I had the Swedish Meatball plate & the hot Salmon plate, they were out of mashed potatoes for the Meatball plate so I substituted French Fries. First, the good: the French Fries were perfect- well cooked, hot & not skinny, also my customer interaction with everyone at Ikea, has been great- very friendly, super informative. Now for the bad: EVERYTHING else was over-cooked. These were well thought out plates, that should have been great..... just not well planned for a busy Cafeteria venue. They need to cook in smaller batches, watch sitting times in their storage ovens & taste & throw out old, over-cooked items &/or under-cook their food from the start, knowing that they will continue to cook in their storage ovens. One last thing, their 75 cent coffee, is the 2nd worst coffee that I have drank in Vegas...... but it was free with my Ikea Family Card.  This was my first dining experience at Ikea & even though it wasn't great, I plan on eating there every time, that I shop at Ikea, until I have tried their whole menu.

It still amazes me how incredibly low priced it was for the amount you get along with the flavors. Not bad at all.   Setting- it's clean, roomy, and bright. You get a view of the Las Vegas mountains while you're dining in. There's chairs and spacious tables for everyone to sit on. And at one area, a couch is available for you if traditional seating isn't your preference. I don't think I've ever seen a cafeteria deserving of a five star rating until I visited this place.  Food- Yes, it's cafeteria food. No, it's not disgusting like the ones you see in public schools! I've mentioned above that when you pick a plate, you're getting your proteins, vegetables and a fair share of carbs. It's almost as though, they wanted you to not only enjoy your meal, but they want you to enjoy it the right way. What better way is it to promote healthy eating with a balanced menu?   The options are small, but they work. First you have the Swedish meatballs that's complimented with mashed potatoes, gravy and vegetables. Ah, I love it! While I didn't try this particular plate, I had the pleasure to try its rich gravy. May I just say, incredible?  I opted for vegetable balls. Don't ask me why; I'm a sucker for imitation meat. It's not one of those super processed vege balls you buy at the store. You can actually see the vegetable bits in those bad boys! It's like my mom trying to shove vegetables down my throat, and I actually ended up liking them!   Okay, the vegetable balls were topped with some type of bean/chili sauce which perfectly complimented the meal. I have to say that I didn't think it would work, but I prefer the pairing than gravy! It was soft and I ate it with delight! It almost tasted like real meatballs which was fantastic because I really hate missing out on good food! The vegetables were broccoli, orange and yellow carrots along with cauliflower. Yum!   Customer service- nothing too exciting in this department as their job is to just hand you the food. Still, they could've been one of those grumpy servers, but they seemed to be okay with what they do.   I would come back to this place. With affordable food at super awesome portions, I prefer this than any other fast food. Or may I just say cafeteria? A must try when you're in the area! :D", "Date": "2016-07-22", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Suzanne", "ReviewID": "oht8zpSHRAudW642K3rb4w", "Overall": "5", "Content": "This place is awesome!!  The large windows and views alone give this place 5 stars for me. They have tons of tables, and couches where you can sit and lounge. The food is standard ikea food, except they have crawfish which I've never seen before. Maybe it's seasonal?    Meatballs are my go to. I always ask for extra gravy.   And don't forget their amazing chocolate cake!", "Date": "2016-11-22", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Chanel", "ReviewID": "crYKiQsfzn0dicLMJuOzgA", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Damn it was 5 of us 3 kids meal and 2 entrees $40  ok I like the meatballs I had one from my bf he said the rest was cold than next salmon dry veggies look like the one they serve in jail lol cheesecake dry..the other meals was like mac n cheese and chicken tenders like the ones u get in TV dinners..I was so excited at first that my own family was laughing because they knew I was disappointed and I wanted my money back but I just sat their and stayed quit and tried to look for the positive but I couldn't find any and I got more mad anyways nasty school foodish still want to try the Swedish pancakes and maybe buy the packaged meatball and make it at home but yea I don't think I can spend that much money for nothing again", "Date": "2016-06-27", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jamielyn", "ReviewID": "ZdSyitYLCgvFzlaNPfaWBg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Finally got to eat at the cafe last week! Got the Swedish meat balls with their mashed potato and Mac n cheese! IT WAS DELICIOUS! We went 30 mins to closing so they didn't have a lot of other things but my plate was still good. I have been craving it again and can't wait to go back! This time, I'd like to back for their cheap breakfast.", "Date": "2016-07-27", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Andrea", "ReviewID": "UVG2niEiJF8v6Rk3a9tmHw", "Overall": "3", "Content": "I have never been to an Ikea and all I heard about was their amazing meatballs so I had to finally make my way down to the new store in Vegas and try them.  I have to say I think everyone may have hyped them up too much because I thought they were just mediocre. They weren't bad, just not anything special.  The prices were really reasonable though. For two drinks, three meatball meals and two desserts it was only $22. So great place to go with a large family to feed them.  There is also plenty of seating which is nice since there was a good amount of people there.   Kind of disappointing but still glad I checked it off my list of Vegas things to do.", "Date": "2016-07-24", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Marie", "ReviewID": "7KYDGrjdQ5GgWeEpL0iGSA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Finally! Las Vegas has an IKEA store. I use to drive to CA before. The parking lot is great. It's easy to locate your vehicle because of the alphabetical signs in every aisle. There's so much merchandise to chose from. Everything is very affordable, but yes you must assemble the furnishings on your own. The cafeteria is great. Children 12 and under eat free on Tuesdays with a purchase of a regular meal. The only downfall I noticed was that there was such a long line in the cafeteria...we waited 40 plus minutes just to eat. So many people were waiting in line, but with only 2 cashiers working? I don't understand the logic in that? That was pretty ridiculous. There was plenty of seats available!!! Other then that, everyone was friendly and helpful. So if your NOT hungry and plan NOT to eat. Stroll through and take your time and shop. Note*** They do not accept cash, only debit & credit cards.", "Date": "2016-06-01", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
