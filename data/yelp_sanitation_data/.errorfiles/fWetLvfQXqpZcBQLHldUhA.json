We didn't stay long enough to find out for sure, but my friend did mention that the dealer he had seemed a little clueless about something so perhaps that's their deal.  --LIL UPDATE--  One of the employees messaged me and let me know that they DO Dance and Deal, so there you go! :D", "Date": "2013-08-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "DJ", "ReviewID": "tQ7g7xTXxDPbkm-Auh5o3g", "Overall": "4", "Content": "The table area is legit.

Cons: resort fee is too high and shouldnt be necessary this is not a resort and doesnt offer anything,  no fridge in room, no microwave in room, the elevator system can be chaotic at times, we were kicked out of the pool at 7pm in 117 degree heat...we paid a   resort fee  and were kicked out of the pool???? absolutely ridiculous,  Supposedly its only open certain times, pool is tiny and not private, you have to walk through valet to get there.  Overall other than being thrown out of the pool it was a nice stay. To those people complaining of the noise you're in Las Vegas what did you expect?

Nothing was done not even an offer of a room change because the hotel was full. This morning while Ray was taking a shower the same image appeared again I then went down to the front desk to once again let them know what was going on.  This time I talk to a manager I  told him to come to my room so that he could see for him selves he agreed but...he said he needed a witness so he went and got another person to go with him.  we all went back to the room we turned on the shower so that the stream could  steam  up the mirror he turned on his video on his phone placed it in a position towards the mirror and close the door..then the fool started saying I want to play ...at that moment the phone feel to the floor in the  bathroom room when we went In to the bathroom to see what the noise was there was now 2 tic-tac-toe on the mirror and the phone on the floor and to top it off tbe video was 18 minutes long and wouldn't play tne phone kept powering off. I was out i left that hotel and checked into circus circus the hell with The D hotel I won't be back. The following day we went back to the D because they had given us $100 food voucher so we decided to go use it so I spoke with the manager again and ask them about the room you would never believe they had been in that room out but the manager went on to tell me that they went back up to the room and had housekeeping clean the mirror with some type of chemical so they then commence to turn on the shower to fog up the mirror again see if the same illusion appeared on the mirror this time the Tic Tac Toe was gone and it said in large letters   I win  I don't understand why they would rent that room out without letting the next person know what was going on I will never stay there again and it was very strange how that young lady ended up dead in the laundry chute when the doors to the housekeeping area are supposed to be locked how would she possibly have gotten in there they even fall down the chute something's going on in that hotel I don't know what but I have stayed at this hotel several times and I loved that hotel it is beautifully decorated the people are wonderful but that still does not make up for what we went through", "Date": "2016-07-26", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Donna", "ReviewID": "bV4KBrGAcFImCLhSGmoYyA", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Derek and Greg Stevens, you paid so much to renovate this old hotel, but couldn't you afford to put anywhere on your website that you are going to hit us with a $23 resort fee to help you pay for those renovations?

My only tip is some of the drinks are sweeter than the others so you have to  drink them before they melt if not it will put you in a diabetic coma for real! The green apple frozen drink is really sweet when it melts so you have to keep stirring it to keep the liquid from settling at the bottom. They have ladies that dance on the bar to the bands that play for a little added entertainment while you order and drink you drinks.

We arrived late on Friday (around midnight) after driving in from Orange County. We found the parking garage and drove up the narrowest entry I have ever seen. We continued going up and up and up passing dozens of empty spots that were reserved for valet.  No problem,  I said,  I;m sure this structure has a lot more stories.  We finally got to around floor 10 after making continuous and tiny circles that quickly made us dizzy and noticed that the spots were no longer reserved for valet, they were however either marked for Enterprise rental cars or filled with furniture. Yes, old furniture was thrown into empty parking spaces and in various spots out into the narrow path.   Ok, they're remodeling, no big deal.  I reassured myself. We continued upward until we got to a dead end. No spots. Not one. A line of cars behind me and nowhere to turn around made me instantly frustrated. As I managed to get cars behind me to back up just enough for me to make what seemed like a 400 point u-turn, I noticed that not only does the parking garage not have an elevator that goes to the top, but it doesn't even have stairs! They evidently expect guests to walk down the parking structure in the narrow road.   We drove back down and into the valet area where after some negotiation I was able to get the valet driver to let me keep my car in the front of the hotel while I went inside to talk with the front desk.  The woman at the front desk was friendly but not helpful. She offered no solutions on where to park other than valet which was not an option for me as I was going to be in and out regularly and the tips and time would add up quickly. I then decided to cancel our stay but did not receive my first nights deposit back. (I called a manager later and she did refund my stay after much hesitation and negotiation)  We ended up staying at the Springhill Suites in Las Vegas. It was less money and absolutely excellent in every imaginable way.  Overall, I am very dissapointed in  The D  as I was very excited to see their new renovated rooms, but after seeing their complete disorganization with their parking and the run down casino that we walked through, it was obvious that they take no pride in their work.

The reason I agreed to stay downtown this time was because that this is one of the newly renovated hotels-it used to be Fitzgerald's.    CHECK-IN The check in process was seamless.  It was such a quick and easy process compared to the larger hotels on the Las Vegas Strip.  The employee who checked us in wasn't too friendly and she didn't go over anything extra-explanation of Wi-Fi, checkout process, etc but she was efficient enough.    VALET The valet service here was good, but not outstanding.  Only about 50% of the time, they opened my door for me.  Most of them just headed straight for my boyfriend's side of the car as he was the driver.  Most times, it didn't take them too long to bring the car down to us and it was a really nice change from the valet at the larger hotels on the Strip.  There weren't any crazy lines or long wait times as there are much more rooms and guests at those hotels.    ROOM The room was pretty nice, I like the red color theme they have going on and there were a lot of red accents in the room.  The windows are tinted and it's not plain tint.  The tint has tiny circles in them so it was hard to take a nice picture of the view from the room.  I liked the size of the restroom restroom, it was pretty large but I had some major issues with the shower.  The first night, I couldn't get any warm or hot water and the faucet was leaky so we could hear it dripping at night.    CASINO The casino is pretty cool, they have go-go dancers for entertainment near the table games and one of the nights we were there, someone was at the main entrance on the casino floor with a big wheel encouraging everyone to play.  They have a nice long bar in the casino called  Long Bar  and everything gets pretty lively on weekend nights.    AMENITIES The D has a small pool up front, nothing too fancy.  I didn't take advantage of the pool during my stay because it was 50 degrees outside.  They have an Enterprise Rent-A-Car on site, their desk is next to the Valet.  They have the D Grill (see my separate review), Andiamo Steakhouse, McDonald's and American Coney Island.  On the outside of the hotel, they have D Bar, which is an outdoor version of Long Bar and it's on Fremont Street.  D bar offers the large drinks (large footballs and tall drinks by the yard) by bartenders who do tricks.  They also have go-go dancers dressed in red and black that get up and dance on the bar.    I would probably stay at The D again if I chose to stay downtown.  The customer service wasn't bad and they've done a nice job with the renovation.  It also helps that when you walk out of the hotel, you can enjoy the Fremont Street Experience with all of the street vendors, live entertainment, other hotels in walking distance and all that good stuff!", "Date": "2014-02-24", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Chan", "ReviewID": "0n_3k-pAzW9rcY457blakg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Golden Gate & The D are sister properties and they're cool: - Draws a younger crowd (as opposed to The California, etc) - Eye candy GoGo dealers (they start their shifts at night) - The D also puts on the annual free www.VegasSpeedDate.com event (eventually it'll be the World's Largest Speed Date but I think we were a little shy of the record in Feb 2015).", "Date": "2015-02-17", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Chuck", "ReviewID": "PHRsvV-bmwth5E3vMpsE4g", "Overall": "4", "Content": "It's official.

The walls are paper-thin so if your neighbors are assholes, don't expect to sleep. The bed was super hard & the air/sleep system was really loud. On the plus side, Andiamos WAS swanky, the servers are attentive and real pros, the food is gorgeous and the desserts quite decadent.

You have to enter your floor number and you get assigned an elevator. We'd have to time what time we should get down and go back to the room so that way we wouldn't have to deal with the crowds of people trying to get on the elevators. After check  in , it took us about 30-45 mins just to get to our rooms.   2) We had a suite in one of the upper corner floors. Upon entering, our room wasn't even cold. But we figured they probably jus turned it on. We all went out, in hopes that the room would start to cool and it did just a little after 5 hours. During the night we were all sweating! Mind you there was only 5 people in our room with us plus a side extra bedroom. Contacted front desk, and they sent up someone to go check it. He decided to argue with us saying that the a.c Is working in good condition (while he's sweating himself) and told us  we should stop complaining. Until we told him  you try sleeping here and see if it's working.  After, he just walked out. Called front desk again the next morning after being to tired to deal with the rude staff and informed them that room was way hotter than last night! Sent someone up again, and was told they would switch us rooms and that it gets hot because our room was directly getting hit by the sun. They gave us a room jus two floors down, which was still sooooooo hot and uncomfortable. We came during the summer, we want a room that would cool us down from the hot Vegas heat! Not in a sauna our whole vacation. Came to find out, the a.c was broken as they brought in a new one. Ugh.   3) The hotel room itself had modern looking furnitures. The bathroom was huge with glass separating both shower and toilet. The bed was still in good condition, unlike other beds around downtown.   4) The valet is easy to find and very friendly. They were really fast when getting the cars as well.   5) The casino is small and limited with slot machines and just a few tables. The roulette table during certain time periods would be $5 dollar instead of $10.   All in all, our experience there was  okay.  Probably would be sticking with the strip still next time but it was nice to get away from the busy roads and crowds.", "Date": "2015-11-09", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Turd", "ReviewID": "LzRoU3KLhAaHMsCiSahqyw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "BAR/CASINO REVIEW ONLY.

I love downtown Vegas and it can be a very convenient and cost-effective place to stay. And like most downtown hotels, The D has undergone a makeover and update. (It used to be Fitzgerald's.)  The price was great for our stay here. Stayed for 5 nights for less than $200. The rooms were good. There's only so much you can do to update an old building. But the furnishings were nice and the bed was comfy. The A/C was still an under-window unit, but it worked surprisingly well. And the bathroom was decent too. 3.5 stars.  The casino itself is nice and very much updated. Good options all around. And it has the longest bar in Nevada. I love the upstairs retro casino. There's nothing quite like carrying around buckets of quarters. I could've sat forever playing the horse derby game. And cocktail waitresses came around frequently. 4 stars.  The dining options are lackluster, but there's tons of other options in the immediate area, so that was no biggie. 2 stars.  Valet was relatively quick every time. It was easy to get in and out, and took just minutes to get to the Strip. Again, downtown is a very convenient location - and where The D is situated is particularly convenient. And despite what it says on their website and what I was told when I checked in, valet does not cost anything. It is free (though, you should tip), just like every place on the Strip. 3 stars.  The pool is horrible. But that's pretty much the case with all of the downtown hotels (with the exception of the Golden Nugget). It was just a crappy apartment complex pool. Crappy lounge chairs, no bar, small, etc., etc. But hey, you can always go to one of the pools on the Strip to hang out. 1 star.  It is the staff and check-in desk that pretty much ruined our stay. They had our reservation wrong, despite me having a print out of it and me having called to confirm it after booking online - which means they tried to charge us more. They screwed up the charges on my credit card, which resulted in our room keys not working every single night. And no one noticed the problem until our last night there. It was incredibly frustrating. And if my extremely lengthy amounts of time waiting in line at the check-in desk taught me anything, it was that I was not alone. There were some pretty big guest issues every single night. And, of course, they only had one person working at night and no manager. 1 star.

The renovation has totally transformed this hip spot on Fremont Street into a happening, high energy casino.  My only gripe is the resort fee which really doesn't include much, but I realize most properties charge this fee.  Oh well.  One of the more recent improvements to the property includes the addition of more elevators which I know previously had been a major area of complaint from visitors.  The elevators have an unusual system whereby you type in the floor you want and the display will tell you which letter elevator you should get on.  It's somewhat confusing at first as there are no numbered buttons in the elevator itself.  The rooms are consistently clean and the bedding is comfortable.  Noticed on this trip that the bathrooms have been redone and follow the sleek and modern design found throughout the casino.  I really enjoy the high level of service the cocktail waitresses give as they are high energy, fun, and always strive to provide a terrific experience.  Jenny, Sandy, Alicia, Jody, and Shannon you guys rock!!  This is one of the many reasons I come here; excellent and friendly customer service.  In my opinion the D is definitely one of the best, if not the best hotel/ casinos on Fremont Street.

We stayed Saturday June 14-16. Saturday night $49 & Sunday night $22 so that was perfect AND then they hit us with a resort fee of $22.50 per night for wifi :/ . . .we asked to get the resort fee waived because we all have internet on our cell phones plus we were going to party and only be in the room to sleep. Unfortunately, they said they had to charge us. So with tax and resort fee it was $125ish for two nights and 3days. This fee was for standard rooms, meaning that its for the lower level rooms (floors 2-20). We all opted to get rooms at a higher floor so that was an additional $10 per night (plus 13% tax). We also opted for a late check out for  Monday at 3pm that was $16.95 with tax. So total we paid $165 per room.  We got two rooms on floor 29 (double beds) & 1 room on the 31st floor (king bed). The bf and I got the room on the 31st floor and we had the  luxury  of getting a fridge (that never cooled our beer!!), a sofa bed, coffee table with two chairs, & a view (not great).  Other reviewers have complained about the noise level at night, problems with the elevators, & the parking structure. My only complaint is about the parking.

Nowhere did it state on Hotels Tonight or The D's website that I would have to leave a 100 dollar deposit or else I would have planned accordingly.  Once I arrived to check-in, I was notified that I would have to leave that deposit. I informed the manager Chris that it didn't state I needed it and I didn't plan for that. He then told me he would waive the resort fee as long as I left the deposit. I agreed to that and told him I needed to step away from the counter for a second to take care of the banking side.  When I returned to the counter, the lady at the counter who I worked with prior didn't want to help me and Chris clocked out. So I had to work with a new desk person and manager and explain the situation all over again. I was then informed that my reservation was canceled and I had to rebook. I was then told there was no way to waive the resort fee and they couldn't honor what Chris previously said he could do. So someone is lying here. I had to rebook and ended up spending way more money then I needed to.  Once i go into the room, the TV and safe didn't work. I had to call downstairs to have a tech come up which was rude to me. And the icing on the cake was the nasty bathroom. There was hair and gunk all over the sink.

They have a great staff of people and seriously every employee that I ran into had personality and something good to add to my visit. Yes, the elevators SUCK but I can see that they're putting in two more. Yes, the rooms need serious over-hall, as in new toilets and tubs, but you're warned that something is going to be sub-par with your stay by how low the cost of the rooms are. They need to seriously stop advertising that they have a pool because I've been to a few dog parks with watering holes better than the pool at the D.

And the AC in both our rooms did not work well and don't get me started on the loud noise it made while it was on.  It was blowing out warm air.  We could not sleep because of the heat.    I called the front desk in the morning to complain about the the AC units.  The electricians came to replace both AC units in both rooms which took 1.5 hrs.   We couldn't leave the room until they were done. The replaced AC units worked better, but not great and the noise continued so good luck trying to sleep. The electrician mentioned they have been working all night on various problems in the hotel all night and expect to have more problems through-out the weekend.    We couldn't even open the curtains because the heat from outside was so hot and talk about getting second degree burns when touching the window. I'm not kidding it was that hot. So, we had the curtains closed the entire time and  were in the dark (except for the lights which seem to make the room warmers) pretty much when were were in the room.  That night, all of the elevators were  down and they were shuffling 10 guest at a time to take the service elevator up to your room.  Talk about warm being crammed into a small service elevator.  We heard the next day, one of the elevators with people in it dropped 5 floors. Lucky my family was not in it.  The front desk did not tell us the coffee in the rooms were not free and they really didn't tell you where the elevators were at, give you a map of the casino nothing, so be sure to ask.  They basically get your information, give you your key and send you on your way.  And the pool is nothing but a back yard swimming pool with about 7 lounge chairs no umbrellas and if you like lounging by the pool near the street with traffic streaming down the street not to mention the huge buses rolling by this is your place.  You have to walk out of the hotel to another building of course they did not tell you that at check in. I asked a couple of employees where is the pool and they just pointed.    Valet is free, but expect to wait 15 - 20 mins to get your car.  They only had 2 guys each day taking and dropping off car for the guest.  Best thing is to call ahead that's if they answer the phone.   This place is joke, I haven't seen so many electricians running from room to room not to mention Otis elevator techs running through the hallways and people in the elevators when they did work or you waited about 5 - 10 mins complaining about all the problems they were having (AC being one of the biggest problems).

While I am impressed at the upgrades for the rooms, the resort fee and the  benefits  you receive are appalling.  In fairness, I did book the room for under $20/night, but the $20+tax resort fee they collect is one of the highest in town.  I've stayed at a ton of hotels and it seems around $12.95 is the norm.  At most hotels, this includes wifi, fitness center access, in-room coffee, local calls, and sometimes a couple of bottles of water.  I think at Circus Circus they gave me daily coupons for a coffee at their coffee bar.  At the D, you get their lowest tear of wifi service, which seems to be a reasonable speed.  There is no fitness center.  They have Keurigs in the room, but they charge an outrageous $2.50 to use a capsule.  These are capsules you can buy retail for around $0.33 each, and I guarantee you The D is not paying retail for this.  It really feels like a money grab, and it is just disgusting to have one of the highest resort fees in town with the lowest amount of benefits.  Front desk staff agreed with me on everything I mentioned above but put blame on the CEO, Derek Stevens, who will drive out a regular clientele if nickel and dime-ing locals is their goal.

My non-smoking room also smells like smoke, and I had to park on the 7th floor even though there were floors and floors of empty parking because they reserved the first 6 floors for valet.

The room was beautiful and the elevators where a bit too high tech for my liking but cool none the less.   the real problem was that they over charged me when they were only supposed to have charged me the resort fees.   it took 4 day s to get this resolved.  the 4 stars are because MR. Hung Huynh (manager) went over and beyond to hear me out and change my mind about his hotel experience. Not only did he apologize for everything and for the person who made the mistake of overcharging but for my inconvenience with my finances and the bank. he refunded the over charges and waved the resort fees for me.   His kindest gesture that earned him my respect and wanting to go back is that he offered a complementary night to redo my experience.   \ The most admirable part of the hotel is that the owner is present every night in the same spot talking to his guests and listening to any changes or complaints they may have.

I tried to push the door, turn the knob and lock it but it would not go through. I told them about it and they got their Engineers in to fix it for me. 3) The elevators are terruble.

The rest is just sbowing blurry background with a message stating no signal. 5) The room smells pretty bad. 6) The sink is clogged and the water doesn't drain fast enough. 7) Their WiFi access code doesnt work! 8) They don't have deadbolt lock on their door. They used the 70`s type chain instead. This is my first and last time at this hotel.

The room itself was decent. A king size bed, two chairs, and a little table.  The bathroom was just a standard bathroom with a shower tub, sink, and mirror.

They didn't tell us that rooms on the odd side of the hotel will catch ALL of the  noise from Fremont street.  So while the live band was still playing at 2am, the front desk said they would move us to the other side and that apparently it was our fault for not asking in the first place. So we move to our second room.  We get in at 2am, get unpacked, turn on the AC and it sounds like its broken.  Its shaking and making a horrible noise.  I walk over to inspect the unit and it falls out of the wall......I could see the outside from the hole in the wall where the AC should be.   So now my wife is pissed off, she walks down and gets up moved again.  So now we are finally in the third room a little after 3am.

The floors were clean.  The carpet in the living areas and the tiles in the bathroom were in good shape.  The king size Serta was very comfortable.  But the 5 (or 6) small pillows were horrendously uncomfortable.  Just give me a normal pillow please!  I guess that's what happens when you let decorators pick the pillows for the bed.  The air conditioning worked well.  They provide a safe that fits a laptop and then-some.  No coffee in-room coffee makers was a disappointment.  The windows!  The D has, or could have, an awesome view. of the mountains.  In fact, it could be a selling point.   But instead, they chose to put an advertisement wrap on the building, which ruins the mountain views, and the exterior of the windows are caked with dust and grime.  The jets in the tub were filthy.  I thought it was strange that the tub's floor was convex, which made it difficult to balance when taking a shower.  It would be almost impossible for an elderly guest to balance themselves in the shower.  Look ...this goes for all hotels ...GET RID OF THE JETTED TUBS!  They are disgusting and impossible to clean.  In all fairness, The D isn't the only property that I've visited with dirty jets.  The water gets scalding hot, so be careful when taking a shower.  I'm not sure if a neighbor flushed their toilet, or what.  But something turned my shower water hot as hell, and I got a minor burn.  But I move quickly!  Noise:  The walls are thin.  I could hear conversations, televisions, coughing, etc.  Running the fan muffled the sound.  The sound from the Fremont Experience was minimal.    Casino:  Clean, but loud.  I was pleasantly surprised at how clean they keep the casino.  The well presented employees were all friendly.  I enjoyed the daytime dealers much more than the nighttime  go-go  dealers.  I just didn't have any luck playing Blackjack at night.  The nighttime dealers weren't as friendly, patient, or fun as the daytime dealers.    Wish they had a coffee shop on the property.

I would recommend ear plugs to those people or request to get a room on the quiet side of the hotel (if there is one). This was my first stay on Fremont and it was like a totally different trip than the times when I have stayed on the strip. For one, it is nice that everything is laid back and you don't really have to dress to impress. Also I liked that there are so many places to eat, drink and party for really cheap. It was a nice change.   I will add though that 2 of the 4 elevators in the hotel were broken for at least one day. This was a major problem and our party nearly got in a fist fight with 2 crazy broads that pushed my friend and verbally assaulted her in attempt to cut into the elevator in front of the people that had been waiting for over 20 minutes. I called down to guest services who knew about the broken elevators and requested that a security guard be placed in the hall until they had 4 working elevators - but really I am surprised that they had not done this already, even if it was just to alert people of how to get to the stairs or that they would have an excessive wait.", "Date": "2013-05-14", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Marcia", "ReviewID": "UIrXdsYrAGgjxODtCp4g_g", "Overall": "3", "Content": "So was convinced by husband that staying in Vegas during our road trip to Hoover Dam was a good idea. And in some ways he was right. The D on Fremont Street was VERY affordable $15 per night plus the resort fee via Hotels.com. so a total of $37 per night meant we could get two rooms instead of sharing with the kids. The front desk even made sure we had adjoining rooms. The rooms were clean and reasonably updated. Except for the shower tub combo from the 70s which was probably one of the original spa tubs ever made. The nozzles were large and rusted looking. Since we were only showering it really did not matter but the price makes more sense with that tub situation. Beds were comfortable and we slept well. Breakfast in the hotel on the 2nd floor was OK.  Of course it is Vegas so you have to tolerate the smell of smoke everywhere. Coming from California it does take some time to get used to it. Interesting characters in the casino.

Tonight is night five of a stay and I figured I would close it out by seeing Purple Reign tonight. I happily walked to the Club D counter and informed them of my desire to go to the show. They said tickets were $45.50. I asked if I had any comps. The nice employee checked and said I had about $17 at this point and that I could apply them to the ticket price. I pulled out my room coupon for $10 off any show in the showroom. She informs me that I can use them both together but I have to buy them from the box office next to registration. At the box office i'm told this is not true. In fact I can't use my comps there because they have no card swiper, they tell me go back to the club desk and they will print you a coupon for your comps. I go back to the club desk where they tell me that's incorrect. Now the woman at the club desk walks me over to the ticket desk and after they have a discussion i'm told that I can't use my comps for show tickets and that is not allowed. I asked about printing a coupon for my comps as the ticket guy said, they said they don't do that but maybe I can talk to a casino host. I'm escorted back into that casino host room and the first woman takes my info, sees I stay at The D often and says my gambling is pretty good  let me see if we can comp you a ticket for tonight  she asks me how many, I say just one. She comes back with the Executive casino host who tells me. Nope! A) You can't be comped because you don't gamble enough B) the fact that i'm a frequent guest means nothing at all to them C) he will allow me to use the $17 for a cheaper ticket but in no way can I possibly use my $10 off any show coupon because it can't be used with any other offers. I said my comps aren't offers, that's based on play and nowhere in writing on the coupon does it mention this. That was that. What a miserable way to start my final day here. I was in a good mood excited to finally see this tribute now I can't even bring myself to buy a ticket based on that nonsense. I tweeted the D and derek stevens immediately after. I'll surely compose and e-mail. Just disappointed that the place i've given so much time and money to would treat a guest this crappy. The executive host is Eddie Villarreal.   Somehow he got to be an executive by being relentlessly rude.  I have many other stories from my stays but they always tried to make it right.  You can only give a place so many chances.

A few highlights- centrally located in downtown, easy self parking (except it starts on 7th floor), free for hotel guests.   Property is nice and fresh, even the garage looks newly painted.   Check in time is 3, check out 12.  Check in went a bit awry,  but I think it was a one off. Getting through line was very quick, getting through check in on the other hand took 20 min. First, the clerk processed my ID, CC and the whole bit, asked a whole bunch of times which one was my first name on my ID- come on dude, we are locals, same order as on your ID. Then after doing whatever in the computer for good 7-8 minutes he hands me a piece of paper and tells me- all set. All set for what? No room key, no directions to elevator. What just happened? Did I refinance my house? He goes- oh. Wait. You are checking in. Yes. Yes I am. We talked about it.   Another  what's your first name? Can I see your ID? CC?  Same circus. Finally hands me a key. I ask for second key. SAME CIRCUS again. He finally looks up and goes- you are all set. I say- so...I can't have another key? He responds with deep frustrated sigh and goes  let me try again . Oh no.... Let's not try again...more fussing ensues and he finally explains- this thing is down. It will be a half hour. Ok good. We could have started with that. The entire interaction took 20 min and the only bit of conversation I got was repeated requests for my name, ID and CC. Meanwhile the guy next to him is chatting up a storm with guest after guest, talking about rooms, zip line, explaining all deals and coupons enclosed with the key. Not my front desk nazi.  The room is spacious, so is the bathroom. AC unit is a noisy old school contraption and there was a peeling outside decal cramping my 31st floor view, otherwise very nice.   Bathroom is definitely looking like it will be the last stop on the route of the remodel train.  Many mirrors in the room, love the one by the window with a huge ledge- awesome spot to put all your make up stuff on and go at it with eyeliner, with great view and lighting.   Appreciate that the dining guide has actual full menus of all restaurants on property, plus delivery options. Doesn't seem like there's room service.  Elevator is a fancy concept of entering your destination floor before you actually get into elevator. Very cool, and a girl posted in the lobby happily explains how to use it.  Pool open 7-7, yay. You actually have to walk out to valet area to access it. No frills, small space, but it feels cozy. Jetted hot tub. No bar, boo.  Property has an interesting second floor  old school casino  area, complete with a bar (only two weak beers on tap, stick with  The Long Bar  downstairs) and an outdoor patio, fantastic for people watching, must check out.

I ordered spaghetti and meatballs and a side salad with Italian dressing. The salad was a decent sizes and it was very yummy and filling, it filled me to the point that I couldn't eat my spaghetti. Stayed downstairs playing slots for a bit till it all of a sudden hit me and I had rush to my room. I have not left my room since last night 10:20 pm.

[I wanted to start a derby page located at the D as I did with the derby at MGM review. This review was placed IN the D ( as a D ) review. I also tried writing a message to the powers that be to this affect. It has gone with no response.]   One of my concerns is that Circus circus enterprises- no, Mandalay resort group- wait, MGM Mirage- please, stop, MGM resorts international (wait, what month is it?) will get their foothold downtown. They could change places people go to every year into something generic (but put in cool furniture!) and shut down sections so  V.I.P  can buy their way into them. This is how they bump a casino up a star rating (meaning a dollar sign) on the strip.   Sigma Derby is a throwback to those old coin cup, black fingers days of slots and gaming. When Fitzgerald's couldn't make it as the Fitz, they were circling the drain and we lost another grand old casino of Fremont. But the D impressed me with little gimmicks and not going too far with the airport hotel look that new casinos jumping on board the de-themeing train do.   Seeking out a Sigma and restoring it to it's own Arena of Battle upstairs was a great move. Even back in the Fitzgerald days, the upstairs was known mostly for their cheaper, nickel coin slots before printed tickets started taking over. We'll give you the convenience of not lugging a coin bucket around if you pay no attention to those tickets with 3 cents you ditched that expire and go into our hidden Superman 3 half penny/ will disappear when an exec retires account.   When you approach Sigma Derby, it's like a wrestler entering Madison Square Garden arena. I heard people yelling in a large circle with a huge smoky glow of light emanating from the center and you have to push your way in. I can only imagine from movies that's what it's like to walk up to an illegal dog or cockfighting ring.   Derby is kinda like that arcade game, where all the race cars or units are hooked together in 6s, everyone will have to face the winner at the end and be gracious or understandably hate that fuck, because like life, only 1 person can win within yelling. Everyone else loses and probably paid for that win.   Takes me back to dollar beer and hot dog nights in my early 20's @ Golden Gate Fields. *Pleasant sigh*  Of all the gambling I've done in Vegas, I won 1 medal, against my 5 friends at the race car game when it was upstairs at the NYNY arcade. Imagine if they handed out a horseshoe laurel (and hardy handshake) of flowers to the 200:1 winners @ Sigma. Udamntopia!   On a weekday morning this game was busy. And there's even a camera to take pics of you, and you can put it online! Instant gloating gratification, yes please! It's a 10 seater and probably the only casino game where I'm concerned when one of the spaces is taped up. Can't they fix it? Don't they know this seat is 20% of the Nevada toy horse derby income demographic?!   This was a very special machine, apparently it's the same machine I used to play at the New Frontier, it was conveniently located in the main artery just outside the sports book and close enough to the toilets so you don't miss a hot 200 quinella.   When you have a shot at a 200 win, I play no less than 3 quarters. Since you get hand pay on 500 or more, I always go for $200+. As much as I love gloating at the ka-chink ka-chink ka-chink ka-chink ka-chink ka-chink rapid fire payout victory salvo, I want a human to come over and count out a freshy stack o Bens as they offer me a suite in the villa.   I bet this is going to argue that I can't post this under  Religious Organizations,  but I BEG TO DIFFER.  So much fun! I want to be in that miniature land, in the center where the horses sit and watch their kind race around them. It's my cool blue ocean when I have to find my calm center in the middle of the weekday grind. I have recorded it on my cell and have used it as a ringtone. Yeah, that's right  I only know of 2 Sigma Derbys in the valley? What say you, Laughlin? What's up, Reno? Your move, California come latelies. Any others on the western seaboard to be found?

We stayed just one Tuesday night due to a family emergency. I had been sleeping in a hospital waiting room for a couple nights, so just the sight of a clean bed was enough to bring me to tears. Still- I was really impressed with the room over all. I loved the clean lines & bright bold red. It was classy and fresh... not something you find on Fremont often.   The casino was nice, if a little cramped. Lots of fun slots, which I enjoy. It is a little difficult to navigate and the  front  desk appears to be in the BACK of the building. Perhaps if you valeted... but the parking signs were weird and it was difficult to figure out where exactly to go outside.   The  Vintage Vegas  area is cute and a nice nod to the history of downtown. It was easy to find the restaurants up there as well.

Liked the fact that it is in the middle of Fremont street. We had booked a regular room and when we got there at 1:30pm our room wasn't ready, check in time is usually 3pm. They tried to up sell us the  king corner room suites  that were ready for check in ,for an additional $20 a night. I had first said no then after going back and forth with the check in girl she said she was going to give me the king suite for  only  $15 a night. So after paying for the upgraded room we got our king suite room on the 32nd floor. Ok so the king suite really isn't as great as I expected. It has a small couch with 2 chairs and a small side table. Items also include in the room, a small refrigerator that doesn't really keep things very cold and has a funny smell to it. Only used the thing to keep my water bottles a little cold. The king size bed was nice and firm. Low quality 25-27  flat screen tv that has a handful of channels. It contains a safe for your room that is hidden behind a drawer, which is somewhat awkward to get to because it is so low. Bathroom was poor by my wife's standards. When you flush the toilet everyone on your floor hears it too. The shower temp is hard to regulate, either it's too cold or scalding hot. Housekeeping, for the first few days our room was being clean by the housekeepers. Towards the end of trip I had to call the to clean my room because I sleep through the cleaning schedules(they clean at 830 in the morning to 11 and the last one at 3:30) they said they would try to get to it time permitting since all of housekeeping clocked out. Our last night coming back from Vegas activities our room was not even touched! We told the housekeeper on our floor we were leaving and she had all day to clean, no rush. The pool, I didn't use it because when you see the location of where the pool is. It's located on the front side fenced in and very unappealing. Overall the stay was bearable because me and the wife had a good vacation.  Note: when checking in please asked for the highest floor you can get because at night the Fremont experience starts and the music is blaring.all the lower floors are very loud because the music stage is right next to to hotel rooms..", "Date": "2014-09-27", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Mohammad", "ReviewID": "TEnJisd1cjbgit3cyXBlaQ", "Overall": "1", "Content": "a little late on the review. but had to share this. this place is horrible . rooms smell bad, on our stay they had no water the whole night. and when we complained they offered $ 5 doller off out food. no thanks.  if you go vegas  stay out of this hotel. it was our first time. after 2nd day we moved out this place it was junk.  it is pricy, i think econolodge is much better than this .

The breakfast is eggs, bacon, hash browns and toast, cooked very fast and was actually good. Leave a tip the meal is free okay, enough said.

When I got to my room they called and said  Oh sorry but we don't do that anymore, so I explained and she said hold on let me get my manager. Ok, so the smart a$& manager comes on and I explain to her about what I was told and when I called and was told to request it, and it's still on the website that you have them available...she says  well we're not responsible for the information on the website and we do have Mcdonald and the Grill if you want coffee besides we did give you a 5.00 voucher when you checked in! .....So I said that's all you can say!!!

Upon arrival, our friends were in front of us and received their room assignment, when we got up to the desk we were told our room was not ready.  We stated we paid for Thursday night and that a room should be available for us and that our room must have been given away.  The desk clerk stated, with a strong attitude that she didn't give our room away.  At this point we asked to see a manager.  Unfortunately, we did not get her name as she was just as rude stating we didn't understand that the hotel was fully booked on Thursday and it took time to clean the rooms.  We then stated that she didn't understand that we paid for Thursday night and a room should be available as it should have been empty and that they had double booked.  The manager stated that our reservation had been previously changed to only reflect a reservation on February 20 and 21.  At this point we assumed the reservation assistant on February 14 that we contacted made a misunderstanding and changed our reservation and we asked them to please call our cell phone when our room was available.   About two hours later we received a phone call that our room was ready.  We proceeded to the check in area and were again taken care of by the same clerk.  She brought up our reservation and stated that we had prepaid for Thursday and would be staying two additional nights, my husband is hard of hearing and asked her to repeat what she had stated.  My husband and I stated that our reservation was right all along and that the manager and clerk had blatantly lied to cover their mistake at which point the clerk stated she read it wrong and it was half prepaid for two nights.

After all, The D (besides standing for the first name of the owner) stands for the Detroit heritage of its ownership.  It does not, however, stand for anything phallic.  At least in this case.  People need to get their heads out of the gutter or learn about midwest nicknames or something.  That all being said, I was not blown away (that double entendre was not intentional) by this casino.  There is nothing besides a National Coney Island (the only one outside of Michigan) to really denote this place gives props to Detroit.  And I was really disappointed in the ownership for that.  Without that little special edge, I found The D to be just another boxy casino to gamble in.  At least the first floor of it.  The second floor differentiates it slightly from the pack in that it contains that cool downtown feature, gaming machines that still take coins.  While I didn't partake (call me modern, but I like my credits in paper), it was cool to hear the clink of coins when people won and the second floor props because of this.  And the fake horse racing game was fun to watch even though I didn't play.  The people at the table get into it just like a real horse race.  Speaking of the sport of kings, this was the casino where I watched the Kentucky Derby.  Their sports book was surprisingly not that packed for the event.  Sadly, it seems like an afterthought (with no Michigan team paraphernalia or anything). It was the smallest I saw in all of Las Vegas.  I did win some money betting on the Chicago Bulls there.

I like crazy Fremont and there's nothing more awesome then stepping out of one of two doorways that lead straight into the madness.  I was there last weekend when the tribute to Rock of Ages was going on, and one of the stages was right next to The D- awesome!  This was my first visit to The D. I purposely stayed in a non-renovated room, and I must say- it was kinda icky for $44 a night. The rug and chairs are old and dirty- really, they should charge less for these rooms. And the cleaning was a bit lax. My remote control had God-knows-what caked on it. NASTY!  The elevators are so friggin' slow to arrive. Sometimes a crowd gathers while you're waiting for one of the elevators to show up, only to find the elevator to be too crowded. They only hold 10 people apiece. The ride itself is remarkably fast, so I don't understand what takes them so long. Had I been on a lower floor I would have taken the stairs.  Speaking of floors, apparently the renovated rooms are towards the top, and I hear they are nice. They certainly looked nice in the photos shown to me at the front desk when I checked in, but I refused to pay $20 extra dollars per night. I almost regretted that decision when I saw my room, but I reminded myself that I was really there to have the experience of being right on Fremont Street, and I was ok again.  I got a free voucher for the Courtyard Grill, the onsite restaurant.  The voucher was for a free breakfast, which is served all day.  Basic dice-sized squares of potato, two eggs, bland sausage (or bacon) toast. Meh.  It was ok, dawg. A little pitchy.    I liked the balcony off the bar on the second floor, even though it's kinda small. It gave me a new view of Fremont, and put me at eye level of the zipliners, which was amusing. People seemed to enjoy the Long Bar.  The casino was kind of fun. I know that some people who see themselves as serious gamblers are annoyed by the dancing girls, but with those girls comes music, which really livens up the place. It reminded me of a low-rent Planet Hollywood, and I had to appreciate the attempt. It gave the place a lively, happening feel which you don't get from some of the older Vegas casinos because they cater to a...um... older, more conservative crowd.

That is the ONLY reason why The D didn't get 5 stars. They eventually got the elevators working which still took about 5-10 mins to get to your floor.  It's right in the middle of Fremont St. We had a view of the tail end of Fremont St. facing container park so the noise was very minimal.   I would stay here again in a heartbeat just know that around say 2p-6p is rush hour for the elevators so plan according but this is Vegas so that won't be hard.   The rooms were way bigger than I thought they would be a king size bed with couch, chair and desk area. So having people stop by to pre-game wasn't a problem at all.   Looong windows so you had a view of all of downtown part of the strip and the mountains of course. A/C worked almost TOO good. -- That is not a complaint.

Boy, were we pleasantly surprised!  ALL of the staff we dealt with were exceptionally nice and very helpful.  The room, not renovated, was super clean and a lot larger than we expected.  There was a table with 2 chairs, and also a very comfy club chair, so that you didn't have to sit on the bed all the time.  No coffee in the room, but there is a McDonald's downstairs.   The things we didn't like aren't about the hotel part, but the player's club and the Courtyard Grill.  Our room came with 2 free breakfasts for each night's stay, which for us was 2 nights.  The first morning we got to the restaurant around 11am, were seated right away, and then proceeded to wait...for drinks...to have our order taken...for drink refills...for our food...All in all, we were sitting at that table for an hour.  The food was good, but the service was LOUSY.  However, free is free so we went back the next day to try again.  We had to wait a bit longer for a table as the restaurant was packed and there seemed to be only one busboy.  The service the 2nd time around was fantastic.  Even with the wait for a table, we were out of there in 30 minutes.  Stay away from the scrambled  eggs,  tho. I don't know what they were, but they had a weird texture and taste.    My other complaint is in regards to the player's club.  The first day we were there, we got cards.  My account was new so I got a whoppin' $3 in free slot play and I was told that for every 50 points I earned in the first 3 days, I would get $5 in free slot play.   AND,  the lady said,  Today you earn 5x points! For the holiday.   So off I go and by the end of the 2nd day I had 106 points that I decided to redeem for my free slot play.  I go to the player's club counter and the lady says,  Oh you don't have enough points.  You only have 46 points.   WHAAATTT??  Apparently, what the lady didn't know the day before is that only  base  points count towards earning free slot play.  Any points earned during a special promotion don't count.  Well ok, whatever, but she didn't have to be so rude about it.  Half the player's club staff is rude, and the other half don't know what they are doing and need help from the rude people.

I used to play that back when I first started to come to Vegas in the 90s but then all the machines disappeared.    We went on a weekend night, and tried to valet the car.  It looks like you can or should only be able to valet if you are a hotel guest, which I think is pretty lame.  They have a small space.  The valet staff was pretty young.  My husband had a foot injury and so we had rented a power scooter to get him around and usually needed help getting it in and out of the car, and assembled, so we always used valet, and might I say, at most properties, we were welcomed.  This place seemed a little snootier.  But they accepted our car, grudgingly.  Of course the valet staff didn't offer to help us in any way.    We got into the casino and I knew the Derby was upstairs so we proceeded to look around for the elevators.  The place is really more for younger folks, I think.  We're 51 and 62.  The recorded music was BLASTING at club levels, and there was a long bar of hipsters looking around to see what kind of fresh meat was coming into the area.  The pit area has got go-go dancers in scantily clad outfits, dancing, while people play table games.  Maybe the men find this appealing, I wouldn't.    We did finally ask someone where the elevators were after getting some unhelpful looks from everyone there, and found the Derby.  There was a loud group of 30-something men playing it....not like I recall in the old days.....and all the seats were full.  As the music and the noise level of people talking was pretty high, and the place is pretty small and close, we decided to leave and go get our car.  We ran into several drunk people on the way out.    It took them longer to find our car than other people that came up to valet after us, and after I tipped the valet guy, he just walked away and didn't offer to help in any way, or even close my door.

Therefore, this could be a little biased.  Gambling: Top floor is  Vintage Vegas  with coin operated slots and other old games. This was my favorite part of The D. The lower level has normal slots you would see in other casinos. The table games were lower priced compared to the strip. I assume this varies by time and day, but tables started at $5 which was a nice change from the $15+ I saw on the strip.  Food: We ate at the D Grill. It was decent food. I dont think there was anything too special, but did notice some local Detroit call outs in the menu.  I saw they were opening an Andiamo's restaurant which are nicer places scattered throughout the suburban Detroit area. If the food and management is the same in The D as it is in Michigan, this should be a success.  American Coney is a staple in downtown Detroit. Growing up in the Detroit area, I never though of Coney Islands as anything unique.

The food is just ok but the show is a ton of fun.  2) The rewards club gives freeplay without requiring you to put your own money in the machine. 3) they still have several old machines which I prefer to the new 30+ lines and steal a coin to play for big bucks machines.  4) there is still a lot of cheap gaming although that may disappear to pay for the renovation.  The rest is the same.  Smokey, lots of slots, a few table games, mediocre food (although I heard Don B's is good, the rest are not worth trying)  The Fitz (I mean D) continues to feel like a trap for unsuspecting young partiers walking along freemont street.

I like the fact that, unlike The Golden Nugget, The D's parking garage is connected directly to the hotel. Arriving late at night, I do not like to catch an elevator down to the ground floor, roll baggage across a driveway into the hotel lobby, then catch another elevator up to the room, upon checking in. The D's registration is conveniently connected to the parking garage and located near the elevator on the ground floor.   The very warm and friendly registration gal gave us a room overlooking the mountains on the 33rd floor. The rooms have been renovated and although not everything is spanking new and replaced (chipped bathroom tile floor, hanging metal from shower head), the room was functional for our needs. Most importantly, my Mother and I found it to be spacious and clean. I liked the Keurig coffeemaker for my tea-making needs but did not use the K-cups because there is a hefty charge. Our 33rd floor housekeeper was very accommodating.   We had a little trouble with a disappearing DND sign twice and the long-term parking ticket malfunctioning twice upon exiting the parking structure, but that was nothing compared to our valet experience upon leaving the hotel. On our last day, we were directed to valet the car because self-parking was full from the evening Downtown activities. I'd like to mention here that the valet guys in general need to be trained in customer care. Often, the valet is the LAST impression left with a hotel guest, and as in this case, can make or break the overall hotel experience. The valet should not expect that hotel guests will know exactly what to do when valeting a car. Unfriendly Valet Guy #1 who received the car caused me concern about leaving my rental with someone as unfriendly as him. He did not offer a greeting and did not prepare me with any instructions on how to go about leaving the car and retaining the valet stub until I asked - hey, some of us NEVER valet our regular cars...perhaps this is the reason why.   Anyway, upon retrieving the car, Unfriendly Valet Guy #2 takes the valet stub and walks away without saying anything. My Mother and I proceeded outside with our 2 suitcases and 2 carry-ons and after standing in the driveway for a bit, another valet guy (the only one who smiled) tells us that if we are waiting for our car, we should be standing across the way in a separate area. I told him,  Thanks for telling us!  I was most disgusted with Unfriendly Valet Guy #2 who drove the car to us and who I tipped $5 prematurely. (Blame it on sleep deprivation and my overly-generous Mother). Yup, #2 eagerly accepted the tip and then, just stood there holding the driver's door open while watching me and my 77 year old Mother struggle to put the baggage into the trunk. Personally, I was not intending to tip at all, because the hotel forced its guests to valet and The D charges a $20 daily resort fee.

First, let me tell you a little about ourselves. We named one of our boys  Daniel Ocean , as in the movie  Ocean's 11  with the Rat Pack. We dig Vegas, as you can already tell, but not the pretentious tourist-trap that you find nowadays on the Strip. I'm talking about the cool-as-ice, no-nonsense, hip but not cheesy Vegas from the 1960's. Being born in the 1970s made me miss this era. Lucky for me, The D simply gets this concept and knocks it out of the park. Its small space allows a more intimate feel where the dealers and the cocktail girls know your name within the hour and remember you all weekend. Yeah, that's the way Vegas should be.   Our room was a standard 2 queen beds. Simple decor, but not plain. Definitely on the hip side. The beds were super comfortable. Slept like a baby all weekend. Room was clean, and the maid service was prompt. I'm a no-nonsense guy, and that's all I ask for. Therefore, the D hotel rooms are aces in my book.  Anyways, as I was saying earlier, we were there for the ACM weekend. If you haven't been to Vegas during this weekend, you're missing out, even if you don't like country music. Free music from country's biggest stars right on the Fremont Street Experience. We bought tons of alcohol from the local gift shops at reasonable prices and left it in our room to chill in ice. You probably won't believe me, but our room at The D was a 5 minute ROUND TRIP to the Fremont Street Main Stage right outside the D's main entrance. I was able to leave my group, go to my room and refill on beers, rejoin my party, and only miss out on 1 song. Incredible, right? I've stayed at the MGM before, and in that monstrosity of a hotel/casino it's taken me 15 minutes (fifteen!!!) to travel from my room to reach the Strip... one way!!!  Second floor casino is awesome as well. All the slot machines on the 2nd floor pay out in coins, so the old-school  cling-cling-cling  of coins landing on the slot machine trays are back! First floor is the main casino, and the main attraction are the  Dancing Dealers . Not only are they pleasant to the eyes, but they're awesome dealers as well. Usually Blackjack is bland, but the dealers get into it and really ramp up the excitement. I felt as if I was playing Craps given all the excitement that was going on at the Blackjack table.  Is this the most luxurious casino in Vegas? No, not by a long shot. However, The D deserves the 5 stars I gave it for the biggest bang-for-your-buck you can hope for. I spent $177 (+ hotel taxes and NO resort fees) for 3 nights on a prime weekend (ACM Awards), and I had the best time ever.

They could have doubled the wait staff and everyone would have been happy with their tip totals. I promise you the servers would have been happy sharing.  The slots were paying out. The sigma derby game was fun but there were a lot of 20 yr olds sitting there not playing. You should have seen the argument I got in when I asked one to move so I could play my quarters. Yes I said quarters, save your change people.  If you stay there and they ask you a high or low floor always go low! I know that seems odd as you want a view but the elevators suck sweaty monkey balls. It took over 20 minutes to go up to the 19th floor. 35+ mins coming down.   We won't make that mistake twice.

We had 4 in our group and when we booked, we reserved a 2 queen bed, non-smoking room. When the other couple in our party arrived to check in, they were told that we had already checked-in and that we are getting a king room with a pull-out couch. Understandably confused, our friends wearily agreed that this arrangement would be fine.   When we met up with them later, they told us what the check-in staff had said to which we stated that we hadn't set foot on Fremont before we met up with them.  So after arriving in the room, we called downstairs to tell them that there was a mistake and we indeed requested a 2 queen bed room.   Instead of apologizing and admitting to the blunder, the hotel staff asked,  what do we want them to do about it? .  Well for starters, I guess if we are to be stuck with this room, some bed covers, sheets or pillows for the pull-out couch would be a good start? *smh*  Whatever, we made do with it since we weren't in the room for a cumulative of more than 5 hours that night.   Many reviewers will bring up the subject of the high noise level. I don't know what time these people are going to bed, but when we rolled in at 4 am, we could not hear any noise from the Fremont Experience.  I still love the casino for the only one of two Sigma Derby being offered in the Las Vegas Strip and vicinity. The video poker machines paid a favorable $0.25 JoB and everyone in our group had a really lucky streak at the BJ tables (3:2 payout).   I wished we remembered our dealers' name, she was cracking jokes left and right, so funny and sharp!

But be all that as it may; I am easy to please and adventuresome and safe when travelling so I made the best of my experience here.  First off, let me say that if you plan to enjoy  The Strip  a great deal then this will NOT be the place for you.  Transportation back and forth gets very expensive and taking the shuttle's or city buses can be a little annoying and/or seedy.    I myself enjoy places with an earthy vibe and all walks of life (within reason).  So as I was only staying a few days/nights it worked out mostly and if I wanted to primarily enjoy this little (Poor Man's Vegas) area again I would come back just to get away from some of the showy, superficial, slick activity/folks in Vegas.    What I see here is that they're trying to do major revitalization to this area and I feel like in about 5 to 7 years it will be aces!!!  Already there are some amazing amenities, features, eateries and development . The owner of the d is a visionary who sees the diamond in the rough and is spot on in leading the way to the redevelopment here in downtown. Hotel has been fabulously modernized and was a decent stay for the most part.   It is clean warm and perfectly located near so much tht you can truly get all you need either within the hotel or very close by. Beds are soooo comfy; staff are talented, efficient and quite helpful - honestly I feel as though they are top notch as far as customer service and that is a huge plus! Casino is also nice; I am not a huge gambler but I won a little more here than anywhere else - just on the slots.

I tend to go about 7 or 8 times a year and like to spend some of those trips trying out new places to stay.  So, this was my first time staying on Fremont Street.  My initial impression of The D was fairly positive, they offer free valet parking, got to like that.  It is conveniently located right in the middle of the action.  Generally, that area is very lively at night and is a lot of fun.  Anyway, back to the hotel.  The check-in was located next to the garage elevators, which was great as you did not need to walk through the casino to get to the hotel lobby.  I signed up for The D club card, as I do like to play table games and a lot of hotels have memberships and provide comps for guests who play, more on that to come.  The room itself was very comfortable, but will be noisy at night because of the Fremont Street activities.  I asked for a quiet room and they accommodated me by giving me a room on the 23rd floor on the odd room side.  They have a quirky elevator system that requires you to enter your floor number, and it assigns the elevator that you will use.  No floor buttons inside the elevator if you change your mind, not sure I like that, but interesting.  As far as restaurants, I only got a chance to eat at the The D Grill for Breakfast and Lunch, but both meals were excellent, enjoyed them immensely.   The Casino table games were very good and it effused great energy and atmosphere.  I really enjoyed it.  However, I was extremely disappointed in the club card and the comps they offered.  I will use Hard Rock Hotel as a barometer with this analogy.  The Hard Rock gave me a steak dinner and drinks, while The D gave me a French Fry, a single French fry.  That is not how you get players back to your hotel, or maybe they do not care.  Ultimately, for all my playing over 3 nights I got $13 off my breakfast, errr Yeah.  Anyway, I would not recommend signing up for their club card.  However, if you are on Fremont Street and are an occasional player. I would recommend their casino.  If you are a major player, stay clear as the benefits other hotels offer far exceed what The D apparently provides.

We pulled through valet, and the attendant immediately rolls down the driver side window without even saying a word. Now, that is normally not an issue for most people, but we didn't even have a chance to explain that that window doesn't roll back up without a mechanic taking the door apart and doing it manually before he rolled it down. Long story short, we still had to park in the garage with a down window all weekend. Forward to check in. The front desk staff told me that I can either have a smoking double queen or a non smoking king, those were my only options. The manager (Chris is his name) told me that smoking rooms came on a first come, first serve basis. Well, no one on the phone had cared to explain that to me. Because I was already pretty upset, he said he would give me a $30 food and drink voucher. I thought that was pretty cool, until I tried to use it and it was only good for a $5 discount. The pool area never has enough furniture, even though there is plenty of space for more chairs. On top of all this, the elevators take forever to get you to your floor, there is no such thing as a quick trip to your room. I have found many of the staff members to be quite rude and unhelpful.

As we're getting ready for a show at the Wynn called 'Le Reve', she runs into the bathroom FREAKING OUT over something flying around the room. I've been staying in hotels for the better part of the last decade, and have had plenty of crazy, memorable experiences, but none like this.. I walk out of the bathroom to A HUGE, DISGUSTING BAT flying right for my face!! Yes, a BAT in our hotel room! The way they handled the situation was more disgusting than any flying, rabies-infested, rat with fangs!! They sent 2 people (maintenance and housekeeping, I assume) to deal with this, and we had to explain to them we couldn't stay or change rooms right now, because, after being terrorized by a wild animal in our room for 30+ minutes, we were late for the highest rated, most lucrative show in Las Vegas (Le Reve, which cost us $337). We rushed out, and paid even more for a Lyft car in order to save time finding parking, and missed the first part of the show. Not only do we not know how much we missed, but we had to disturb everyone in our row who paid just as much, and embarrass ourselves to get to our seats! I called the front desk at The D as soon as the show was over, and instead of the nice dinner we had planned, we had to rush back to deal with the assistant manager, Simone, before she left for the night. First, she tried the typical low-ball move and offered our resort fees back. This is money they stole from us in the first place, as The D is NOT A RESORT!! That's like if I stole someone's wallet, then threw a BAT in their face, they should accept their wallet back as an apology! I can see trying to dismiss a guest who didn't like the way their room smelled, or had flies, or roaches, or even a mouse. NOT A BAT, the most terrifying animal there is! We decided to accept a suite, but had to wait until the following day because there were  none available . I truly feel like it was strictly because we weren't important enough, and not the availability. First we had to pack up our stuff around 1:00am, after our  romantic Denny's dinner  because the steakhouse at the D was closed, unbeknownst to Simone, and move down the hall, to a room opposite our bat feces contaminated room. The next day, after 12:00 checkout time, I went to the front desk to get an ETA of when our suite would be ready. Rather than give an ETA, Kyra (the daytime supervisor) kept giving me a passive-aggressive grin and saying,  We really don't like to give estimates like that, because they could be wrong.. ! That's why it's an estimate! We just wanted something to plan around! After a long yelling match over that, I asked to speak with someone from housekeeping who may have some information, or at least be justified to give us the estimation for suite availability. Kyra wouldn't even humor me on that account either, because she obviously didn't want to risk being wrong on her  2:00pm  estimation that she tried to send me away with. After she realized I wasn't going anywhere without some information that would help us plan the last day of our vacation, she went in the back office for a minute, and tried to convince me that housekeeping said the EXACT same thing as she did. After speaking to the housekeeping manager, who was called by a housekeeper in a nearby room, I found out they had not been contacted for this ETA that Kyra lied to me about. She actually tried to make me feel petty, as if we were being spoiled with this suite after escaping rabies in the first overpriced room! On top of the poor management, the OWNER of the place (whose picture was posted all over the building, and on the default TV channel in the rooms) did absolutely nothing when I showed him video of A BAT in one of his rooms. Instead, he patronized me, embarrassed me in front of my already irritated, mistreated friend, and continued to drink himself beyond his current belligerence. I can see why the managers couldn't care less about wild animals flying through hotel rooms, and high paying customers not being satisfied with their stay! Why would anyone care, if the owner doesn't care? It really must be nice to have the kind of money that makes you indifferent to feedback from your own customers. This place should still be Fitzgeralds! The D is the biggest joke of Downtown Las Vegas, and I hope you don't let them ruin your already expensive vacation, or, like in my case, truly meaningful vacation, by exposing you to diseases, then brushing you off the way they did to us. Go with the Golden Nugget, which could actually consider themselves a resort, as I hear their pool is one of the nicest in the country, unlike the D, who apparently had just enough money left after training managers to forget all about customer service, to add a Motel 6 pool!

The D rang in at $59/night with no resort fee, although I upgraded to the corner king at $69. We had previously been into the remodeled casino so we were eager to try out the rooms.  Check in went smoothly with a short line at about 10pm.  We then headed up to our room.  No security at the elevators and non guests could get to the guest rooms, which didn't leave us feeling warm and fuzzy about the security of the property. This problem was exacerbated by the fact that the escalators to the second floor casino was out of commission.    Getting off the elevator I was greeted by a really old dingy stained carpet and peeling wallpaper, not a good sign. Fortunately after opening the door to the room, I was relieved.  The room was completely remodeled. The room had new carpet, new bed and lines and  as spacious complete with a sofa for seating.  A small fridge was present as well.  The corner room had a view towards the mountains out of two sides. Unfortunately a noisy window A/C unit remained. Overall I would rate it comparable to the Golden Nugget Rush Tower Rooms.   After dropping off the bags I headed down to meet up with my friends in the casino.  We signed up for Club D, played our free $3 on the slots, and some of us played some table games.  $5 blackjack on the weekend was a welcome sight that would not be found on the the strip.  We didn't end up staying too long because the music was just too loud and the place was filled with smoke. I am struggling to describe the clientele, the best I can come up with is Tattoo and Fanny pack central.  Due to the out of commission interior escalators we headed out to Freemont and up the exterior escalator. In the upstairs casino as advertised were all the old coin operated machines.  Seeing the Sigma Derby machine, coin slots, and keno machines that used a light pen was awesome, but I think our group of 30 somethings brought the average age of the clientele up here down a few pegs. My friend did pull $400 out of a 50cent Wheel of Fortune machine.  Good thing that machine had ticket out.  I was going to die of laughter if it spit out 800 1/2 dollars when he hit the cashout.  We then bugged out of the joint and hit Golden Nugget for the rest of the night.  After returning to the room my friend stopped for a Coney Dog, he said it tasted ok, but was annoyed that he couldn't get a beer to go with it.  He ended up stopping at the Long Bar to wash down the overly sodium filled dog.   I got a great night sleep on the comfy bed and was pleased that a 12pm checkout was standard. Most of the strip properties have switched to 11am.   All in all the place served its purpose, a cheap above average room on a weekend night, I hope they continue to the renovations of the public spaces including the hallways on the guest room floors. In addition, I would like to see them turn the music down a notch in the main floor casino and keep some of the riff raff away from the guest room elevators.  Would I stay here again, sure, but only if it remains less expensive then the Golden Nugget.", "Date": "2012-11-25", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Samantha", "ReviewID": "8oihBXTXxax3AWWCdNSfiA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "formerly the fitzgerlad, This is my favorite casino downtown.

My wife and I stayed in a suite on the 26th floor on Labor Day weekend, 2014. The hotel is in a great location, right on Fremont, downtown! There is so much to do within walking distance. As a frequent Vegas visitor, I may have become a downtown convert. I've stayed on the Strip every other visit and staying downtown was much more comfortable than a huge resort. Getting to the strip was a 15 min, $25 cab ride. I know there is also less expensive options, like an express bus.  The room (Suite): * 3 flat screen TVs in the living room which was very cool. * Comfortable king sized bed, but only 4 small pillows which were not enough. * Nice bathroom soaps/shampoos. * No robes or slippers. It doesn't seem right to stay in a beautiful suite and not have a robe! * We kept getting a 7am wake up call that we never requested! Even after calling to have the wake up calls stopped, they still persisted. I'm glad I was an early riser. * In the afternoons, sometimes there was no cold water! This made for VERY hot showers. * Only 2 towels were provided. This seemed needlessly frugal for a king suite. * The suite door didn't quite fit in the door frame, leaving space you could see through to the hallway around the edges. * Just a nit, but they didn't have the Golf Channel and a few channels in general. Of course, this wasn't a big deal, since you shouldn't be sitting in your room in Vegas anyway. :-)  The hotel: * The elevators were repeatedly a problem. They would break or not allow more than 3 people on board before giving a weight alarm. They have a specialized system that assigns an elevator to you based on what floor you select. That means that if you get assigned a broken elevator, you'll be waiting a long time and probably not able to get on when it arrives! This was a very frustrating experience. It was exacerbated by the fact that the stairwells were locked! There were no options if you got stuck in this situation. How can they block the stairways?! * No gym. * Nice, but small pool on the ground level. * We didn't get a chance to go to the Andiamo restaurant, but I can't wait to go back and try it out. I heard it was great from multiple sources around town.  The Casino: * Good card games paying 3/2 blackjack. * I signed up for the player's club, but didn't play enough to see any benefits.  As mentioned, the overall experience was positive; however, it seems like it would be easy for The D to make it so much better.

I've been coming to Vegas two or three times each year since 2008, and have always opted to stay on the strip.  However, when hearing about the renovations going on at The D, my friends and I figured we'd give staying downtown a shot.  CHECK-IN The check-in process went off without a hitch.  Granted our flight landed at 8:30am local time and we had to check our bags in since our room wasn't ready, the front desk called my on my cell phone when the room was ready (approx. 2:30) so we could come officially check-in.  ROOM Overall the room was nice.  It's about the size of your standard hotel room, two queen beds, a desk, chair, one person sofa (not a recliner) type of seat, a little front area with an ironing board, and a nice bathroom.  I also like the colors of the refurbished rooms.  The reds, blacks and greys stuck out at me for some reason and I liked them.   CASINO The casino was my favorite part of my experience at The D.  Even if you do not stay here (or downtown for that fact), you should really stop in and check it out if you're at the Fremont Street Experience.  Almost all the time you can expect to find lower table limits ($5), as well as some higher table limits ($25+) in their high limit lounge.  I also personally loved the energy within the casino between the dancers and the music.  You also need to venture up to the casino on the second floor of The D, titled 'Vintage Vegas'.  They have slot machines that pay out in actual coins (US Currency) and they have a rare but working Sigma Derby machine which is a blast to play!  AMENITIES The pool is nothing to brag about, just a square pool with a few chairs and sunbathing beds.

So let's do the math. Paying half again the price of the room in hidden fees? Um ok. Whatever I guess. So we check in, and go to the elevators. The single most infuriating thing about the hotel. Sounds like a stupid thing to complain about but YOU HAVE NO IDEA! Instead of an  up  or  down  button on the elevator, you punch in the floor you mean to go to and it TELLS you which elevator to board. So you are sitting there, waiting for 15 mins (NO EXAGGERATION) for your elevator. Meanwhile, elevator B has gone up and down twice past your floor but if you get on that one it won't stop at your floor. The program says elevator A and you MUST ride that one. So as you are waiting, more people are coming and all of them also get elevator A. The sign on the wall says only 10 people can board the elevator at a time and there's 35 people waiting for elevator A. So FINALLY it gets there, we all try to pack in and there's an annoying buzzing noise. We have exceeded the weight limit. So half the people get off, get back out and have to wait another endless amount of time for the next elevator. Not me tho, I'm staying on this bitch. So we made it to our floor, unpack and settle in, turn the AC on because its like 95 degrees in the room and I check out the little hotel guide to see what my extra $20 bucks a night is getting me. Turns out that our resort fees cover WiFi and LOCAL calls. And that's it.  As tho every adult on the planet doesn't carry a phone with them. So basically, $20 per night for WiFi, whether I use it or not. Well, that's when the Resort fee pissed me off. I wouldn't mind paying a resort fee for a resort. Someplace with a bellhop and room service. Someplace with a girl to bring me drinks poolside and a complimentary show or two. Hell, someplace with a damn COFFEE POT in my room would be nice. But no no... $20 a night... for Wifi.  On Tuesday, my body was stiff so I decided to go down to the pool to sit in the jacuzzi and loosen up, but I was told the pool had just closed at 7pm. Why 7pm? I'm a grown woman, I don't need a life guard. But whatever... 7 it is. I go back up to the room (mess with the AC because it keeps kicking off) and Hubby tells me to go get a massage instead. *happy dance*. I call down to find out where the Spa was and I was told they don't have one. But... this is a resort right? I seem to remember something about a resort fee? WTF!!! So I decide to just stay in and help Kid with his homework. Let's bust out the laptop and utilize this overpriced WiFi. Ha... What a joke. This shit was worse than Dial up in 1998. It takes Kid hours to get just about 1/5 of his work done and we decide to grab the car and go find a place to eat. So we drive down from level 9 in the parking garage (levels 1-7 are for valet only) and are met with a steel arm blocking our escape. We stick our room key in the slot, pull it out... nothing. In, out... nothing. in, out, in, out, in, out... Cars behind us are honking... in, out, in, out. MOVEMENT! We are free! We spend some time on the town, eat some decent food and head back to the room, which is hot as hell again because the damn AC keeps kicking off, and I head down to the promised $5 blackjack tables. After searching the entire casino I find only $10 tables and I am not willing to lose so much so quickly.  I head across the street to play at the $5 tables. Sat down and promptly lost $50 quicker than the waitress could bring me a drink. I head back up to my room,(after the wait for the elevator of course) take a bath to relax my muscles and go to bed. With the sounds of Fremont street and the heat in the room we barely get any sleep.  Weds,  After dinner at the buffet at Main Street Station (definitely try it) I went back across the street from the D and lost another $50. So I go back to my room, take a shower and try to go to sleep. This time I leave the TV on til past midnight when Fremont street closes down and got a little more sleep.  Thursday morning upon checking out we were told that on top of the cost of the room, and the resort fee, there were taxes on both as well. Yes, tax on the resort fee. I didn't know you COULD tax a fee. This brought the cost of the room to close to $70 per night. Hubby tried to voice his issues with the place and the woman at the front desk didn't even look at him.   To make a very long story short, We found out why they named their hotel  The D , because they really bend you over when you stay there. And it was so infuriating that it made the rest of the trip kinda shitty. So avoid the place. It's definitely not worth it.", "Date": "2014-11-07", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Sara", "ReviewID": "q5Kx3_OQsO9vhvBQ0oTfww", "Overall": "2", "Content": "OMG!! The noise!!!

There was no hot water after 11 am and the sink took 30 mins or more to drain (gross).  It was supposed to have been renovated but it's obvious they just painted the walls and put in new furniture.  The bathrooms had not been updated and still had funky old fixtures.  When you used the shower the pipes in the wall would staring making a knocking sound.  The A/C and heat was always either too cold or hot but never right.    The food at the D grill was awful.  The tiny Vue bar had extremely weak drinks.   The outside of the hotel is very sleek and modern but the inside is a different story.  They should have spent more time updating the inside.   The only thing worthwhile at this hotel was the Sigma Horse Race game on the second floor (it was super fun to play with a group of people) and the Marriage Can Be Murder dinner show.   We also witnessed a staff member try to cheat a couple out of quarters at the horse race game.  She refused to return their quarters until a few of us spoke up.  And then we got scammed by one of the valet guys over taxi service when we were checking out and trying to get to the airport. We asked if he would call us a cab because we didn't know where the taxi stand was.  He said there weren't any cabs available but he could get us a limo for $35.  We agreed b/c we just needed to get to the airport.  Then he siad it was going to be a 10 minute wait for the limo and we had to keep saying we just need a cab.  Next he said the limo would be $45 and we said no just get us a cab.  Then a limo pulls up and the valet guy puts our luggage in it and says again it's $45.  At this point we have become very, very angry and so no we want a cab.  The limo driver says he'd take us to the airport for $40 and we agreed just to get out of there.  We find out after we get in the limo that the driver didn't know anything about this exchange between us and the valet and that there were three cabs parked right next to the limo just around the corner!!  The valet scammed us for a measly $10 kick back by forcing us to take a limo.  We suggested to the limo driver not to give the valet the kick back because of the terrible way he treated us.

Drinks are okay, don't go the bar in the casino, if you walk out and make a left there is a Patio Bar that makes awesome drinks at a good price.  The rooms are on the smaller side and older side.

I'll admit, I judged too quickly and thought the D would be a bit blah. Most of the reactions I got when talking about this place was  where's the D?  or  I never heard of that place .  I hosted my BFF's bachelorette party in their suite on the top (34th) floor.  Because of the CES convention, suite prices in town were running $500 and up, which I was unable to afford. I scored the suite for about $180 and the staff honored my request of getting the suite on the 34th floor if available.   The modern suite itself blew me away. There is a wet bar and a huge living area with a wrap-around couch. A small dining table with 4 chairs and 3 bar stools are present as well, perfect for hosting a small group. There's a small refrigerator and a wine cooler built into the counter. The bedroom is separated from the living/bar space. Roomy bedroom with a comfy bed. The bathroom has a huge shower with two shower heads. Different lighting in the bathroom is also available, which is useful for girls that need to primp themselves beautiful. The only complaint I have about the room is that there is no separate bathroom in the living space. So my guests had to go to the bedroom to use the bathroom in there.     There's a coney island hot dog place and a McDonalds right downstairs. These two places became super handy when all of us had a little too tipsy. I wasn't too fond of how small the casino was. I felt that the reason why it was so smoky and smelled like burnt ashtray was because of the size of the casino. The parking garage is also tiny and a pain to drive through. General parking starts on the 7th floor. Anything below that is reserved for valet. But can't blame the D for how small the place is - I mean the building itself was built 30+ years ago.   Downtown Las Vegas is slowly but surely revamping itself and is definitely cool again.

Part of that love is nostalgia.  There is my own personal nostalgia, and nostalgia for historic Las Vegas.  The owners of the Golden Gate decided to preserve history at 1 Fremont Street.  They went the other way when they acquired Fitzgerald's.  I like that people are interested in downtown and willing to put money into its improvement.  I want it to continue to grow and evolve.  However, I think it would be tragic if my downtown Vegas got Nerfed.  Downtown is 'come as you are.'  That makes me happy.  I've observed that there are two poles of intention with night life.  People want to have a good time and/or to see and be seen.  The spirit of downtown is very much the former in my opinion.  People shed their dignity on Fremont Street, unload their self-consciousness, and commune with their fellow humans.  If it becomes more like the strip, expensive, stratified, and snobby, then there's no point in going downtown.  I think  The D or D's or whatever sounds like an attempt to be modern and edgy.

Noise from Fremont street effected my 16th floor room.  Yikes.  If booked on a Friday or Saturday night, this might very well be a bother.  The Long Bar (yeah, that's what it's called), is the focal point and is quite impressive.  Literally, a long ass bar with TV's all along the way, and multiple bartenders doing there thing.  Outside, it's directly on the fabulously touristy Fremont Street.  There is an outside bar, maybe as long as the one inside.  It has a regular bar, and it's upscale.  To the right, 50 flavors of daiquiri's hosted by a sexy mistress type.  I had banana, and it knocked my socks off (and she did, too -- whoa!).  During the day, 55+ year old cocktail waitresses.  Not hip.  Not cool.  But as the day turns into night, they get younger and the hotness turns from lukewarm to nearly hot.  Multiple go-go dancers, up to 6, are in the table area, and well, are quite steamy.  The casino is small and very smoky.  Most of the the clientele had cigarettes, puffing away killing themselves.

There was plenty of seating and lots of tvs, and a decent selection of beers on tap.  The bartenders were friendly and the service was quick.  I didn't do any gambling, but it is hard to miss that there are go-go dancers in the pit.  I will never understand the allure of this, but then again, I am female.  They seemed to have a wide selection of table games with decent limits (per usual Downtown).  Upstairs I felt like I struck gold.  The D has 1 of only 2 Sigma Derby horseracing games in Las Vegas.  It's seriously old school - it only takes quarters (luckily there is a cashier cage nearby that will give you a roll of quarters so you can play).  This isn't a machine where you win a lot of money, it's just fun and something different.  The highlight of the hotel is their new Italian Steakhous - Joe Vicari's Andiamo.  The ambiance is very nice, the service is amazing and the prices can not be beat.  I highly suggest checking this place out if you get a chance (review for the restaurant coming shortly).

Self parking is limited to the 7th - 9th floors.  The parking area is unclean and could use a lot of improvement.  The elevators are horrible.  Many times there was a backup that required many minutes wait.  Oddly, you may be told that one elevator will take you up then another opens which is not available to you.  Most times it's faster to take the escalator to the second floor and then get on the elevator there.  When I stayed some in my group had a $5 off coupon for the D Grill while others did not.

Whenever visiting Vegas, I always enjoy staying in Downtown Vegas just cause I'm able to see some faces I'd see back at home, so it's comforting.   Don't get me wrong, the hotel is nice. But the service is surely something else. I needed a room that could accommodate 5 adults, and 2 young children. I'd ideally like something that offered 3 queen sized beds, but figured that 2 queens sized beds and a sofa/sofa sleeper would suit us. Prior to booking our room, I called the hotel personally to find out more information about a double room that I stumbled onto online. I was told that the double room has a queen size bed in each room, and one of the rooms has a couch as well. I got off the phone, and called again to speak to someone else to confirm the information that I was told. (Which it was) So I thought that this would be perfect and continued the reservation.  When arriving at the hotel, we parked the car in the parking structure...and might I say, this is the WORST parking structure ever. The way it was built was retarded. I can't recall the right number, but I noticed right off the back that the first four or five floors (parking starts at level 3 & ends at level 11) are all reserved for valet. It was Bike Fest that weekend, and also noticed most of the stalls for valet & self parking was FULL of bikes. But the fact that only a few floors for self parking?! COME ON NOW! We LITERALLY had to fight for parking almost each time we parked the car.   Checking in was a pain in the ass. I stood in line. but managed to have at least 3 people cut in front of me when I was next in line, by walking straight to the person at the counter. All employees saw that I was standing in line, but never acknowledged anything at all. RUDE. After that happening, I even had problems getting checked into my room.  So, we finally checked in & got into our room and to my surprise, it wasn't a double room. It was just a room with two queen sized beds and NO couch. Of course, I'm beyond livid after already having trouble checking in, this got my blood boiling. Called front desk to find out what happened, they apologized for me being angry & stated that the room only comes w/ a couch in a room that has a king sized bed. I repeatedly told the girl that I was told by two different people about the room prior to booking the room. So I was stuck with ONE room instead of a DOUBLE room with NO couch. I threw a fit, and they waived the fee for a rollaway bed.   All in all, I hated my stay here. Service was horrible, they give you crappy things in the room & overpriced as well. $4.50 for a bottle of water & $2.50 for a cup of coffee. Wifi cost $9.99/day. Oh, and did I mention that this is the ONLY hotel that I've ever stayed in that DIDNT have a mini fridge OR microwave? Yeah, stupid. Whenever eating out, we were either forced to either eat all our food or throw it out even if there was a ton of leftovers that we could've easily saved for later.   Walls were thin, could literally hear the conversation the people next door was having. Housekeeping endlessly opening our door to clean our room even if we put up the  DO NOT DISTURB  sign up. Go-go dancers were not attractive at all. Could hear noise from outside. We often were RUDELY approached by security when we would enter the hotel with our kids at night, even if we were going straight up to the room. AND I found a bed bug in one of the beds the morning we checked out...GROSS!  In other words, I will NEVER stay here again.

I went to play some table games and the slut that was dealing cards couldn't even really count correctly and had to call over a pit boss all the time. So basically they have untrained staff there. If you complain to management, there at the bar getting drunk, so they aren't really setting a good example for there employees. When you go to the 2nd floor, which is vintage vegas and at the bar, they were doing a flair show in which back then, that did not exist.

The restaurant upstairs next to the showroom wasn't anything special. The food was overpriced but I will admit my hostess named Isabel was very friendly! The eggs that I ordered I requested scrambled and they were runny and not worth the price I paid for the them.

The downstairs is a typical casino, but with low minimum bets, and professional, kind dealers.  I enjoyed the fact that they have girls in skimpy outfits shaking it on little platforms where the pit bosses hang out. They grind and twerk to the music, which gave me lots of inspiration to keep gambling!  The dealers were great. I really enjoyed the helpful guidance of Harry and his trainee, Kevin on their three card poker dealing. They explained the odds, and the bets you can make, and even told stories about the crazy kind of stuff that happens there.  Upstairs is where this casino is different. They have a  Vintage Vegas  area upstairs, with old school slot machines, and a horse racing game that was really cool! The horse racing game had horses on a track that ran around, and you place your bets with quarters, based on the odds displayed on the base of the game. Unfortunately, the machine crapped out, and it ate a quarter of mine, and didn't pay out on the winning horses, like it was supposed to. In the event of a machine malfunction, I guess you don't get your wagers back, which was kind of a bummer, but I guess it was just a quarter. I really enjoyed the old slot machines that didn't have a computer running them, with the rotating drums spinning wildly every time you pump a quarter in. They also had on display some really, really old, beautiful slot machines that looked downright historic. Unfortunately, you can't play on those.  The drinks kept flowing here- in tall highball glasses! They weren't watered down, and were quite welcome. They had a wide variety of casino games, all with low minimums, and a huge selection of entertaining slots to play.  Yes, there were some shady characters who showed up around the 4am mark. A few of them had to be thrown out when they challenged the dealer at the blackjack table. But I guess that just adds to the casino experience. I was approached by a guy wearing latex gloves who claimed to be with security who was most interested in my cigar. However, the real security showed up and threw him out, which was a relief.  The Long Bar was a nice bar, with very reasonably priced drinks. It seems that they missed out on some real good humor by not calling it the  Long D  or something like that.

I've read several reviews complaining about the noise so just a thought... If you want quiet dont stay on Freemont Street, it is an all night party :)    Downstairs the casino had dancing dealers  and the bartenders put on a good show. The second floor vintage slots had a quieter environment. We didnt get a chance to eat at the D Grill because it closed at 10, but Coney island dogs and McDonalds was open 24/7.

The Long Bar is cool, after that a lot of the rest is the same and the concept is really confused as a result of part of the place being changed and the rest left the same.  For example:  The name-  OK the new name is  The D , right?  Well the Fitzgeralds cheesy signage is still everywhere, rainbows etc.     The Dancers - Not hot by vegas standards but seemed to be working it.  The problem is the space is WAY too bright and too big to make this concept work.  The Tables/games-  Plus for lots of blackjack tables but terrible rules continue to ruin blackjack games in LV and The D is no exception.  No surrender on a shoe game?  Please!  Games aren't playable.  The sign on the side of the hotel with a girl in a sexy dress out for a night on the town seems to indicate that this is some kind of sophisticated upscale location.   Yet the place still looks run down and the 60 y/o gentlemen at my table complained that the wallpaper in his room is peeling off.  Again, what is this place trying to be?  Are they claiming they're an upscale hotel?  The Music - Good music, but it is blasting at a super high decible level.  The 2nd floor - Left unchanged.  It's still terrible.  Overall it seems to me like the place is slightly better, however, I feel like it's not somewhere i'd frequent mainly due to poor table rules favoring the house.  It seems like the new blaring music might also alienate some of the current older repeat customers.    What exactly is this place trying to be?

On the other hand Chris the front desk manager was a pleasure to work with and turned our awful experience around.   My Husband and I came to the D casino in late October for our 1-year anniversary. We had stayed there the previous year for our honeymoon. We had a 9-hour drive from Tahoe. When we were about 8 hours away I received a voice mail from the reservations manager saying that my suite was no longer available. I had made my reservation for a food and music festival and had called every day for 2 weeks waiting for them to open reservations. I booked my suite on the very first day that I could, they took my money and sent me a confirmation for my suite.   The reservations manager called me with less than 24 hours until our check in time to tell me that we were pretty much out of luck. Not once did he apologize or have any empathy at all. You could tell he didn't care, and then tried to blame me saying that I shouldn't have been able to book the suite in the first place. After I had made my reservation I called 3 times to confirm my reservation, I called on the Wednesday before my Thursday check in and they said everything was fine. They obviously checked someone in last minute to a suite and bumped me, because the day before they said our reservation was good to go.   Instead of the reservations manager owning up to the reservation department's mistake he just tried to blame me. Then he tried to move us to a much older, farther casino down the road. We had to deal with all of this as we were driving through the desert trying to get there, now not knowing if we had a room or not.   Finally I couldn't deal with the reservations manager and his awful attitude anymore. Seriously, The D, you really need some customer service training in your reservations department, it was bad!!!!   So, I called the front desk was able to speak to a manager and our night started to get a little better once we got to talk with Chris, the front desk manager. I explained our problem and the first thing Chris said to me was  I am so sorry, we completely dropped the ball on this, it was 100% our mistake, and I am going to do everything I can to make this better.   Just him not being a rude jerk like the reservations manager, and just admitting their fault, started to make us feel better. He then stayed an extra hour until we arrived so he could make sure that we were taken care of. He welcomed us with champagne and although we didn't get our suite, he did everything he could to make our weekend better. Chris deserves an award; The D Casino is lucky to have him around. The only reason I would ever consider going back there is because of him.  The reservations department, especially the manager, could definitely learn a thing or two from Chris.

I have never stayed at a hotel in Vegas that wasn't located on the strip, so I was a little hesitant about going.  We were only going to be in Vegas for one night so I figured The D should be fine, and maybe I should stop being so bougie.  When we did arrive, I was pleasantly surprised because the hotel didn't look that bad.  The room was clean and updated, but the bathroom was in major need of a renovation.  The location was decent, but I wished we had more places to walk to.  They have done a nice job with the downtown area, but it is kind of lacking on restaurants and other forms of entertainment.  I'm giving this hotel two stars because all night long,there was loud pounding on our ceiling.  All night long! I  have no clue what it was, but it was extremely annoying. Most people in Vegas don't sleep, but I do, so I needed it to be quiet.

There are a few good and needs improvements that could be beneficial. 1.  We arrived and went to the Valet lane to have our truck parked, we waited and waited, until finally a bell hop came out and said there were only 2 guys working valet that day.  We gave our bags to the Bell Hop and finally got our valet. 2.  Check in was seamless, but the great complaint for many at the check in desk was the $20.00 per night  resort  fee.  I was well aware of the fee, even though I was not sure where the  resort  was, as I never saw any amenities that constituted them as a  resort   TAKE NOTE MANAGEMENT - find another way to hide this fee, up the room rates or what ever, this would save allot of complaints from future bookings. 3.  The Elevators - yes the are small and slow, but honestly the building is built around the elevator and not a whole lot that can be done, but I don't know try using the Bell Hop to take your numerous bags to your room.  After all it is FREE!!!  you can be nice and tip them though, but oh wait - maybe that is part of the  resort  fee.   Doubt it. 4.  We opted for a King Corner room.  The room was clean, nice view - we had a sofa, table, 2 chairs, desk with chair, fridge, bed was comfortable - what else does a room need. 5.  Shower needed a little attention, which any maintenance person can do - but when you turned on the shower, most of the water went out the tub spigot, I am sure it is a simple adjustment.  No problems with hot water. 6.  Had one meal at the D grill - only went there for appetizers, no real problems. 7.  Gambling sucked - but I was never that lucky, easy access to Fremont Street which has plenty of entertainment and things to do. All in all - it was a nice place to stay, just hope that someone from The D reviews these comments and takes them to the ones that can make decisions to make a difference.", "Date": "2014-12-02", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Corinna", "ReviewID": "2zGqeghqFhyR0MxCRSBC1Q", "Overall": "1", "Content": "ok so my husband and I we went for a carshow last weekend with 8 other couples got to the hotel friday, the check in was horrible guest sevices could not find some of tje reservations than charged a resort fee which no one knew about we thought we were getting a great deal for 165 became about 230.

We had watched on our local News channel that they where offering great deals so I booked 4 rooms back in December of 2012 for our May 5 to May 9 of 2013 trip. We where told we would have a Limo pick us up at no charge and Maryann and Marvin did a great job with that. Im sure Marvin was happy with his 100 tip and he deserved it. When we arrived it was only 10am Vegas time. Around noon they had 1 King Corner available so we took that one and moved our luggage, around 4pm they had another king corner but it wasn't until around 6 pm we got our 3rd room and I finally received my king corner around 7pm. It was horrible and the people at the desk had me come back on every hour, I was told what room I would be put in so I went to the 27 th floor and put a napkin in front of the door around 5 and at 630 the napkin was still there, When I got in my room it was wonderful, the view was great but all of our rooms where on different floors and I had asked just a month or so before we came if we could try and be near each other that didn't happen we had the 18,19,27, and 31st and our 75 year old friend didn't have a frig in her room not that the ones any of us had worked well but she was told they would get her one and never did. The front desk needs to huddle, out of 4 people up there only 2 seemed to care about customer satisfaction. It was bad. The Casino was awesome, the dancers, and some of the bartenders where great.  I noticed a couple of the younger ones had some attitude and our small group where very good tippers. We went to eat at the grill and out of 3 tables it took over an hour to get our food.

Do I lace my review with phallic references to the name throughout? You're probably expecting that, aren't you? No, that's too easy ... I'll let the artwork left for me in Room 420 speak for itself.   I generally stay on Fremont St. when I go out to Vegas, and decided to stay The D because they were cheapest for the 5 nights that I was staying. Yes, they do charge a resort fee and you have to factor that in ... but the resort fee includes free WiFi, while the places with no resort fees charge $10-$15 daily for WiFi. Taking all the factors in, The D was the cheapest. (Plus, I'd always liked the vibe at The D and wanted to stay closer to that end of Fremont)  I initially booked a non-smoking room, but decided to switch to a smoking room upon check-in. They offered me Room 420 (insert joke here), a handicap accessible room they had open. I know hotels are dying to get rid of these rooms, but I didn't mind it. In fact, I rather liked the room. The bathroom was huge, and it was on the end of the hall so the room seemed a little bigger and allowed for privacy. And it was right next to the stairs ... a quick left, down a couple flights of stairs, and I was in the Vintage Vegas Slots room. On the down side, since I was on a smoking floor, there was a lingering smell of, as my friend put it, Saturday night bowling alley.  And stairs access was nice because, as others mentioned, the elevator can be a bit of a show, although I really didn't have any issues. They've installed an elevator system that asks you to type in the floor number and then assigns you an elevator, and most always had an attendant there ready to help. There was a bit of a wait on Saturday around 5PM when I wanted to go up to my room, and they did advertise more elevators coming in the future.  I can also second the other reviews about the noise coming from Fremont St. This was double for my end of the hotel, which was literally right above the stage that they have concerts at pretty much every night from 8PM-2AM. Making it a point to NOT be in your rooms during those times while in Vegas isn't too hard - except that I got food poisoning and spent the entire Saturday night in my room. And I could feel every note and every thump from the bad 80's cover band while I laid in bed praying for an end to my misery.  Amenities here are hit and miss. The pool is pathetic - the Super 8/Motel 6 comparisons are spot on, except they do have a hot tub too. The restaurants are solid though - I enjoyed the D Grill and American Coney, and I hear great things about their steak house from locals.   Would I stay here again? Probably. I've stayed at The Plaza, Golden Nugget, and The D downtown. GN is the best, but is also the most expensive. I definitely like The D better than The Plaza. If I were scouting for a future trip and The D was the best deal again, I'd probably stay again.

From day 1 checking in on Friday July 22, we had problems.  The staff at the registration desk are very inconsistent and have no customer service skills what so ever.  Then the entire weekend there were problems with their elevators, we had to use the stairs on some occasions and the freight elevator as well.  The staff kept saying oh your VIP and would take you to the freight elevator.  The elevators there are sketchy and have no A/C.  If there is more than 8 people in the elevator it would have issues and stop on every floor or wouldn't even work.  The wait time for the elevators to get from the 24th floor to the casino floor would range from 15 mins to 30 mins.  I was renewing my vows that weekend and had the limo from the chapel waiting for us and ended up leaving because the elevators took so long. So if you have a lot of time to waste waiting around then this is the place for you.  There is no parking in their garage for hotel guest.  They have about 7 levels for valet and then about 6 for everyone else.  So you don't have a choice but to valet park and then to get your car from valet was a 30 min wait.  8 of us went to the D grill to eat breakfast, waited for over 30 mins and our cold came our luke warm.  When we told the manager she went and stuck her finger in our plates and said these are hot.  The sink in our bathroom wouldn't drain, it would take at least 10 mins to completely drain.  We took the sign off our door for our room to be cleaned and it never was.  Then when we complained about all the issues to Chris Narvaza on Sunday he said he would comp us $100 for 2 of our rooms, so when we went to check out on Monday there was no credit and when we asked to speak with him, he acted like he had no clue what we were talking about.  After reminding him again for another 15 mins he agreed to credit our rooms $100 but comes to find out that he never did credit our room he just released our security deposit hold.

Originally known as the Fitzgerald. The  D  stands for downtown.   I'm from Hawaii, yes Oahu, usually lots of Hawaii locals like to stay at the California downtown, (I don't LOL) but anyway whenever we come to Las Vegas we usually stay at a hotel on the strip because of course that's where the action is! However this time we switched it up and decided to stay downtown.   I booked The D hotel and casino online through Hotwire , for 4 nights our stay at the d cost us a total of $300!   As soon as we got to the hotel, we self parked.  Floors 7-10 is for self parking.  Floor 6 and down is for valet.  Floor 11 I believe is for enterprise.  A couple of times we could not find parking, so we parked ourselves in the valet stalls and we just let them know there was no parking and it wasn't a problem.   ELEVATORS! It's a little tricky but you'll get the hang of it. Press your floor number on the keypad and it will direct you to your floor! :)   The room was nice! The heater was my best friend lol! The only downfall was that it was super loud! The thumping from the street show was just crazy loud and I was on the 23rd floor lol. They stop around 1-2am but I was on Hawaii time anyway so I was able to get through it lol.   Another thing I didn't care for was how the hallways smelt like straight up cigarettes, YUCK. Yes I know people's smoke in casinos I have no problem with that but the 23rd floor with non smoking rooms aren't supposed to smell like smoke.   I loved that they give bath and body products however the shower was weird! There was no door so the water bouncing off your body just got the floor wet it was pointless LOL.

It was detached from the hotel, you had to walk through the lobby, out the front door, and across the valet area. Plus there was construction right next to the pool.

Once i was unloaded at Valet, I asked one of the staff working why the garage was closed and they stated that the garage is under repair for new elevators. Well thats good to know. After I parked over at the Fremont Street garage. Check in went smoothy till i found out that on top of the $20 resort fee that wanted $100 that will be refunded once checked out. Well I did just that and asked about the parking situation. The Lady that got us checked in stamped our pass and said if u leave and come back just bring the new pass back and we will stamp it again.

It's OK overall but nothing real inspiring and a few significant drawbacks.  HOTEL: As with so many other Vegas casino-hotels, it's an OK basic room if you can get it for cheap but I'd never pay full price. Basic rooms are very comparable to the Stratosphere right down to decor and color scheme. Clean, decent bed. Crap TV selection and no coffee but I expect that coming in with a Vegas casino. Only major issues were the dull roar of music from Fremont Street randomly between 6 pm - midnight (drowned out with a good fan for white noise), and the weird art deco sliding block puzzle shower handle that fell entirely off on me while I was in the shower. Who designs a shower handle so that it can unscrew as you adjust the water temperature? Probably some overpaid engineer who puts Ron/Rand Paul stickers all over everything. Anyway.   I can see where the elevators could get annoying if the place was crowded, but during one of the lower-occupancy times of the year they were great, you basically have a private zippy elevator to yourself every ride! Another point I liked is the noon checkout, which is rare for Vegas casinos.  FOOD: A few options including a steakhouse and a Coney Island hot dog place, all I tried was the D Grill which was decent. McDonalds in-house has a little of the expected price inflation, but also has some deals like 2 apple pies for $1. No killer deals at the other restaurants, but the D Grill offers a solid healthy meal for around $15, and you get a $5 off coupon with a hotel stay.    GAMING: If you like video poker there's only a handful of machines, floor is dominated by slots. Decent amount of tables too though it seems they are more for girls dancing on them. Super smokey, I didn't really bother here. Though the second floor with the Vintage Vegas theme looked nice for old-school reel slot fans, and they also have a perpetually-crowded Sigma Derby machine up there.", "Date": "2015-12-16", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Brittany", "ReviewID": "4bkJtdV3FOhDgYnTZp_3hA", "Overall": "2", "Content": "We went to VEGAS in July of 2015 on a trip with some friends and stayed at the  D . I am from Detroit and was very curious to see what little slice of heaven they had recently added to the old Vegas Strip. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed. My room smelled very musty, and my air conditioner did not work properly. I called down and complained and also asked to switch rooms. They said they would fix the issue- next thing I knew the air was cold, but toward the afternoon and in the night the air stopped working again. In the morning on the day of our check out I went to shower and there was NO hot water. THE ELEVATORS ARE A JOKE!!!!!!! I spent half of my day standing waiting for the elevators to get to my room, not only were they very slow (and out of order) but they would beep after being overloaded, and it would take several minutes to get it going. When I checked out I spoke with the staff at the front desk, they did not offer to take my information, let me speak to a manager, or to compensate me for the money I spent on a NON-WORKING HOTEL ROOM. I asked if they would refund my  resort  fee (not my stay I am not the kind of person that thinks I should get anything for free) but they declined and said they are not  in the habit of doing that . I do not think I should have to pay for anything that was not resort like. The only good part about this hotel is the coney island on the gambling floor. I would STEER CLEAR and book somewhere else.

But sometimes a great value like the D Hotel comes along, and subverts that entire axiom.   We were in Vegas for just a couple of days and did not mind being away from the strip. The room was just a regular standard room with a king bed, and it was so much more than the guesses our nightly rate of $64 would generate. The room was simply decorated, but very clean. The room was spacious, the bed was soft and very comfortable, and the little stylistic features of the room made the entire thing feel more like a 4-star hotel.  There were also other little things about the room that you don't really get with a  cheap  Vegas option. Yes, the TV, minifridge, phone, iron & ironing board were all there and worked as expected, but you there were some touches of class that you wouldn't normally expect. How about the nice spacious bathroom? Or the large mirror by the window, or the stylish pair of lamps on either side of the bed? I've stayed at the Vdara, Aria, Planet Hollywood Towers, Treasure Island, and other 4-star-and-up hotels, in addition to more economical alternatives such as Hooters and Imperial Palace. The D Hotel is a lot closer to the former group than the latter.  If being downtown instead of on the strip is no problem for you, give this place a try. It actually worked out for us to be here instead on the strip because we were able to take the freeway to the hot spots. You probably remember how sad you feel for those drivers inching forward once every few minutes on a Saturday night as you're walking past a whole mile of them on your way to Marquee. That wasn't a problem for us; we got from downtown to the the parking structure at New York New York in about 7 minutes.  I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5 because of the parking situation. It's a validation system and it's kind of a pain to get your ticket validated each time. The hotel offers a day-long validated ticket but the system rejected two of these, so don't bother. There are 11 floors in the structure, but 6 of them are for valets and there really aren't that many spots left. This could be an annoying issue. I got extremely lucky and landed the LAST spot in the whole garage two separate times, but I don't think that'd repeat.   All in all, a great option for Vegas.

The room was booked through hotels.com and the total was $32.77... yep, only $32.77 and there's no way that price was gonna be beat on the strip or in downtown. Now I know The D is the renovated former Fitzgerald's and I was cool with that. I really had no visions of grandeur that everything was going to be brand new & transformed like the Nugget. But I was pleasantly surprised when I checked-in. The casino floor wasnt all run-down like I expected. They cleaned it up a bit. The Long Bar was very prominent and was packed with people. They had dancers above some of the gaming tables like The Pleasure Pit section of Planet Hollywood. At least it seemed to me that was the vibe they were going for.  Waiting to check-in was a little longer than expected. There were 3 parties in front of me when I arrived around 11pm on a Thursday night. And of course, there was only 1 person manning registration. Once it did get to be my turn, the Asian woman was very nice & got me going right away. She directed me to the elevator bank & I liked that it was not only real close to registration but also not too far from valet. Very important aspects for me. The elevators are interesting in that you punch in your desired floor and the little monitor tells you to go to either elevator A, B, C or D and that elevator will take you directly to your floor. Genius! Now I've stayed at countless Vegas hotels and that technology was a first for me. Really liked that.  I was assigned a room on the 27th floor. One king bed... It was nice and modern. I was a bit surprised. The theme was dark woods, reds and white linen. The bed was super comfortable and I slept real good. One of the gripes I had was that the AC was bit noisy, even though I was able to sleep soundly cause I was so tired from the day of work, flying & driving... it left me exhausted by the time I turned in. But being that the little noises usually keep me awake, I do not know if I would have slept so soundly otherwise. Another was that the chairs in the room (2 of them) with accompanying coffee table seemed really out of place. The style didnt match the new interior. The chairs were not comfortable & the table was way too low to eat on. Believe me, I tried. And lastly, the bathroom needs some serious updating. It wasn't dirty or anything like that. But it was outdated big time. I mean the hot and cold faucet controls looked like they were from the Brady Bunch house. I've never seen em before. They looked like plastic wannabee crystal knobs directly on the counter. No spacers no nothing. You had the counter then the knobs. Very odd.   And another odd moment during my stay was when I had just gotten in my room. I'd say I was in there barely 15 minutes and I get a knock. Weird... I look through the peephole & it was housekeeping. I thought it was a joke. I thought I was getting punked. It turns out the housekeeping person forgot her bottle of cleaning spray behind the curtains by the window. I mean, I didnt even notice it when I got in the room. It was totally hidden... Weird.  All in all The D is a decent hotel option in Downtown Vegas. The rooms are clean & the beds are comfortable. The staff was friendly and valet was fairly quick and the walk to and from the room to the elevator then to valet pick-up was short. It's also a plus that The D has an entrance via Fremont Street experience. It helps you avoid walking the otherwise sometimes desolate and shady side streets of Downtown. It's also a short (1 block) walk from the Golden Nugget. I'd stay here again for the same price. Now if they could just fix some of the issues I encountered.", "Date": "2014-09-14", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Cali", "ReviewID": "M2X9idFpQ7l0Bj6BsY11xA", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Would give them atleast two stars but they don't deserve it  Hotel room was ok walking into it but the longer you stay you realize you get what you pay for Got this deal during spring break for $250/2 nights & now I see why  Our view from the room sucked, why would you make a 'corner king suite' room posted behind the construction of the light show Was promised a view of Fremont st it was a view alright if you could squeeze your head out of ONE of the six windows to see a little tiny spot of Fremont I do not want to see how the light show is set up from my room with all the wiring and metal everywhere..

Why? You may ask?? Trust me I returned home with blisters so bad I needed to be hospitalized after walking the strip and the experience and trying them all out, from Mandalay Bay to the Freemont Experience for 3 days (Tuesday-Thursday) looking for someplace good. Out of all of the sparse ghost town I found inside the casinos and bars I ran into inattentive bartenders and rude service/security employees until I finally came to  The D ... Not only were they crowded they were fun and had the best pumping jams to listen to while having 4 different sports channels on in the background lining the whole wall rather than one channel with scores here and there...and the tenders (mostly men inside and scantily clad gals outside) inside will even twerk for you and show off their muscular arms too  ;)  they also seemed to be the only place that could make a proportionate drink (correct mix to alcohol ratio) some places I had to ask where's the alcohol?? whilst others I was wondering where's the fruit juice?? Even their attendants for the bathrooms were sweet and helpful as well as their friendly elevator operators/attendees and terrific casino staff and smiling jovial rather then hardcore mean security officers not to mention business was booming (it wasn't another ghost town event) and the clientele was delightful and nice too.

Ok that being said lets go over the list ......  1. The  Resort Fee Scam  - This is NOT a resort, not even close! First of all a resort has hot showers, this place does not. We battled with them to fix our hot,cold-hot,cold shower and their solution was to turn the sink faucet & shower on at the same time for 10 minutes. This is what the very rude & condescending young lady genus named  Patrisha  told us to do to fix a faulty water heater. Lets get one thing straight- I've traveled over to many resorts all over the world and EVERY single one had a hot shower, a heated pool & room service , this 2 star Hotel does not. Can you believe a Las Vegas  Resort  does not have room service? The word  Resort  at this Hotel means you must  Resort  to alternate methods of heating your shower & getting food. You must also  Resort  to sneaking into another heated pool down the street at a Hotel that gives a crap making their guests comfortable.   2. The parking lot pool- We were there for Life Is Beautiful 9/23 - 9/26 and the day time temp was 81 degrees, the pool was 64 degrees. In our room there is a sign that says   Towels are available at the pool area please do not take towels out of the room  . Well it should say if you are not at the pool by 9:00am you can forget about finding any usable clean towels. And it should also say be careful and do not get hit by Valet or Uber when you are crossing the  driveway/ parking lot when accessing the pool. Oh and there should be a sign that says to bring extra change for the homeless meth heads that are allowed to enter the pool area with no security to chase them off. Not to mention the pool resembles my neighbors tiny pool, not like any  Resort Pool   I've ever witnessed. Here is another rhetorical question for ya ( have you ever been to a  Resort  pool that does not have drink service?) Answer : (No)   Ok so lets move on to the pros: After 2 days with like warm/ freezing cold showers the hotel manager waved the  resort scam fee  and gave us a $30 food credit for the D Grill. At least they have one person in their employ that has some sort of training in customer service and it sure as hell ain't Patrisha at the front desk. They did offer to switch us to a new room but when we went down to the desk at 3:00pm like Patrisha told us to she claimed the room was not ready and we should come back later. We were on a tight schedule to see performances so we opted out for the hit & miss shower for one more night.   The location is great for the festival but I wouldn't stay here again. I will walk the extra block to stay at a hotel that still has the true Vegas style customer service mentality.   Bye bye D.

We spent our last night at The D because he wanted me to experience downtown Las Vegas.  I have to admit that I was extremely skeptical going in, especially once we got off the highway.  The front desk staff was friendly and the room was pretty inexpensive, although the resort fee of $22 was almost as much as our room.  That's a pretty steep resort fee for downtown.  I mean, we paid $28 the previous nights at Cosmopolitan, and these two hotels are like night and day.  The room was clean, although the tub was missing some of the porcelain and the shower would not stop dripping all night.  You can definitely hear the noise from the Fremont Street Experience from your room (we were on the 10th floor).  We just turned on the A/C though, and it drowned out the noise.  The location is awesome if you want to experience the FSE, you step right outside and you're right there.  The 3rd street stage is literally right in front of you.  We sat down in the casino to play some black jack and had a fun time.  They even let you order Grey Goose!  That definitely made me a happy camper.  Especially after drinking Stoli at a Harrah's property (Flamingo).  The dining options are good as well.  We ate dinner at Joe Vicari's Andiamo Steakhouse and loved it (I'll write a separate review).  Got breakfast at D Grill, and they also have a McDonald's on the property too.

Resort fees. They are on the high side for Vegas ($20/night) and not a lot to show for it. According to vegaschatter.com it covers WiFi, $10 off the D showroom tickets, and local and toll free calls. I also got a $5 coupon for The D Grill, but as the food there wasn't that good, I'd call the coupon a wash.  Not worth it, to be honest.  Then, I booked a king, and was given two queens. When I argued that, I was told that being I booked through hotels.com my room preference could not be guaranteed. That's bullshit, as the hotel was nowhere close to being at capacity, and she offered to UPGRADE me to a king which means they were available. I had that happen to me only once before when I had booked through hotels.com, but it was at a MUCH shadier hotel, and I'm surprised they pulled that shit in Vegas. But whatever, I was willing to let that go, not the end of the world.  The casino itself is pretty standard, and pretty boring. Nothing to write home about, and other than the dancing girls, nothing that really catches the eye. Pretty bland.  The hotels rooms are okay. My room wasn't completely clean, but it wasn't filthy (lipstick smudge on the mirror, and some greasy spots on one of my headboards). Though what hotel these days doesn't come standard with a mini-fridge?  The beds aren't the comfiest I've ever slept on, but not the worst. Not what I'm used to with Vegas hotels though. Pillows were fairly comfortable.  The worst, the WORST thing was the noise. The walls are paper thin. You can hear everything. The guy in the room next to me had a bit of a cough. I could hear when someone in the other room sneezed. Want to know what your neighbor is watching on their (tiny) TV? No problem, because you can hear it clearly at normal volume.  I was woken up in the middle of the night because one of my neighbors was rather, um, enthusiastic about their bedroom activities.  And if the noise from your neighbors isn't enough to keep you up at night, the knocking noise your sink makes whenever they used water will.  It probably has one of the worse parking lots I've used in Las Vegas. The lanes between floors are steep and narrow, the turns are tight, and guest parking doesn't START until the 7th floor. No pedestrian walk-ways either, so unless you're parked near the elevators you're taking your life into your own hands walking through the (very very narrow) parking lot.  I will never, ever stay here again. The only reason it gets two stars is because it was clean enough, and the beds were tolerable.

Got the 30th floor with a view of The Strip and the mountains.  I could still hear The FSE but no big deal and it ends at midnight on weekdays.  Great room with a chair, small table and a sofa also.  Bath is roomy with a long counter, one sink, fine with me.  Could use a better AC, I had to place my luggage rack in front of it to avoid a direct blast of air, the low setting didn't work.    There was one elevator down and a back up of people during prime time. I've heard that they have a lot of elevator problems.  When coming down during prime time, get off on the second floor and avoid the back up on the 1st. Oh, our ice machine didn't have a bottom below the ice drop so if you didn't hold on to your bucket you'll lose it down a black hole.  I liked the casino layout, not overwhelming like the ones on The Strip. Decent slots that payed out sometimes.  My favorite slots are the Wheel of Fortunes just up and around the corner from the elevators.  The $1 coin Double Diamonds on the second floor have always been good to me.  The penny Red, White and Blues over looking the 1st floor lower level slots are fun to play.  I enjoyed the Coney Dogs and The D Grill has good food at good prices.  Keep the 2 for 1 offers coming and I'll be back.  But all resort fees everywhere have to go.  I don't like paying for things I don't use.

I'm actually kind of bummed that no one in their marketing department has run with that, considering they have no qualms about calling their main bar  The Long D ... which is fairly self-explanatory.  That being said, this place is pure chaos. You have to wind your way through 6 floors of reserved valet parking to find a spot, and corners are blind without any mirrors, and lanes are narrow. Additionally, if the garage is completely full there is no signage nor any employees posted to prevent new cars from entering- I experienced this unique brand of frustration during a visit over the summer. This garage should have been added onto during the reno, as each floor is small and probably maxes out at 50 spaces. For the parking situation alone, I would not stay here.  Once you finally make it in the casino (an assumption, perhaps), I will say that it isn't as smoky as I expected from all of the other reviews here- then again, all of the doors are open to the Fremont Experience and there was a good breeze going.  As I navigated my way to the showroom, employees were few and far between, and those I could find were fairly clueless and most were just standing around- one in particular was wandering the floor with a broom and dustpan in tow and was literally walking slower than a woman with a walker, and kept getting bumped into by patrons who were simply trying to get around the two of them and on their merry way.  On the bright side, the showroom is upstairs and away from most of the hustle and bustle- but they're not particularly organized, either. I was able to pick up my tickets immediately and was spared the line, but I was late (due to the garage situation) and arrived just as it was supposed to start- and yet, the line was wound around the entire floor to accommodate the huge line because no one had yet been allowed into the showroom. After the alleged start time.  On the bright side, as I left, I was not charged for parking despite a giant sign in self-park saying it was $2/hour. I also consider it a positive that the garage exit is run entirely by a single computerized gate rather than a person in a booth. I prefer technology to the quality of casino employee found in such positions. But I'm sure tech issues happen and the exit gets backed up sometimes, but today, thankfully, it was working.", "Date": "2014-03-17", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Fabs", "ReviewID": "dD1GFjzmKx1frYZ4lS5dMw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "This review is only for the casino & the long bar.

We decided to give downtown a try. Our first night at the D, we were given a room on the Fremont side, (it would have been really nice if the person checking us in asked us if we would be out partying or if we would be looking for a quiet night). We dont come for gambling or the night life, my father lives there. I took 2 sleeping pills, nyquil, AND had ear plugs and a pillow over my head and still didnt get to sleep until 3:30 in the morning (this was last weekend). The bathroom had soap scum in the soap dish holder in the bathroom so thick you could scrape it off with your nail. Also there was a thick layer of scum on the batch tub. Really disgusting. So I called down to the desk and spoke to Daniel and he stated they would have another room later but it wouldnt be ready for awhile.   My husband and I pack up our suit cases....however, one of the elevators is broken so it literally takes 25 minutes to get from floor 33 to the casino floor. I told my husband that I wanted to check to if they possibly had a room available yet.   Went to the front desk and spoke with Daniel again and he found us a room. I went to get our car and my husband had to lug all of our luggage all the way back up to our new room. As I walk away from the counter I see a bellboy go by with an empty cart and I am thinking  they have bellboys and that front desk person just let my husband take our bags all the way back upstairs????  He knew we had our bags with us as we asked. I was really shocked and disappointed.   This room WAS quieter, however, the grout on the bathroom floor was so dark (you could see the new floor under the sink and could tell what the color was supposed to be) that my husband kept his shoes on and I wore socks in the bathroom. Also I it took awhile to brush my teeth as the sink was clogged and kept filling up.   Needless to say, the customer services was very poor, the bathroom was dirty in 2 rooms, the odds that the other rooms are clean are very poor. It is very sad because the owner has put a lot of money into the hotel and the rooms are nice, but the hotel staff did nothing for us and let my husband lug our luggage all the way back upstairs.

We don't have a comp room & I'll be damn if I'm paying to stay @ the   D   in the same condition as the Old Fitz!! So between Yelp & any other travel forum I could get a review I did some research b4 I was gonna spend my money on an updated Fitz. Well what a SURPRISE. From arriving @ the Valet parking with no charge & very quick service. So leave a good tip. Parking is very tough n that area. To check-in with no problems & fast prompt service. We arrived around 2pm & they let us ( my wife & I ) check out the room 1st & we could change if there was a problem. Matter of fact we did change from the original room they gave us. Upon examining the new room my wife didn't like the view & with no problem we were reassigned back to the original room based on the Bell Asst. Homers insisting that it was a better room view & location wise. Thx. Homer!! He new if the Mrs / Boss is happy then I'll be happy. To the elevators that were nicely redecorated with a new D ambiance. Yes Homer the Bell attendant who was very helpful & informative. Our room was the Deluxe Corner King. Remodeled, very spacious, pull out sofabed, decent view of Fremont St. & a bed that was awwwww so comfy. After losing money, getting drunk from free shots of cognac ( ? ) & walking Fremont St. looking @ the weirdos & hustlers for hours. A  hug from that comfortable bed & my sexy a$$ wife was well needed.  Cons: Coney Island Hotdog was good but pricey. $4 for a hotdog?? I had 3. It's hard to get a good Hotdog n Cali & I'm originally from NY. So I paid the price. We stayed till Monday. Didn't wanna deal with the Vegas traffic heading back to Cali on Sunday when everyone & their mother is checking out of every hotel in Vegas. So we checkout apprx. 2am Monday. Well there was no Bell service. I had to leave my D/L  @ the Courtesy Desk in exchange for a luggage rack. Kinda tacky if ur tryn to give off the appearance of a Higher End Hotel. No I should say   Higher End Hotel Resort   since they charge a Resort fee.   All in all if ur looking for a 4 star Hotel in the Fremont St area of Vegas U can't go wrong with the D. Book early.

Airport shuttle-bus service typically costs a minimum $8.50 charge one-way, per person and runs every half-hour from 6a.m. to 6p.m. For pickup at other times use our direct phone lines near the bell desk to make your reservations or ask a bellman to assist you. Shuttles make stops at several hotels on each trip, so allow ample time before your flight.   Bullshit!! We tried to get shuttle to airport and was told by two different staff members that you have to call 12-24hrs in advance..If this is not true they need to brief staff for giving out wrong information.

It was a two queen room and there was more than sufficient space for 3 people and all the luggage.  We had a view of the ziplines, but to be fair, I wasn't in Vegas for a view, I was in Vegas for the experience of Vegas. It was easy access to The Fremont Street Experience, the casino opened up to the street. It is centrally located, so access to buses to the Strip was idea.

Was hard to decide because the bad was sooo bad that it's hard to even look at the good, but let's try  Pros- Cheap, rooms cost 30-80 most days (not including resort fee). Good Fremont location, nice to be close to everything for the  Fremont experience . Rooms are okay, nothing exciting but not terrible.   Cons - Resort fee is 20 A NIGHT, for no apparent reason, wi-fi is NOT included, they have no special deals, just a random outrageous charge. Rooms reek of smoke no matter which non smoking option you choose. And the number one reason I just HAVE to make my complaint known - Security. Let me make it known that I had a fight with my wife this night (at a local restaurant, not inside the hotel) and so we were having a quiet night - no music, tv and barely talking to each other, sitting in bed. Yet out of no where we get a knock on the door with someone yelling security. I ask thru the door  What's wrong  and they tell back JUST OPEN THE DOOR. I do as requested and they look inside the room to see nothing exciting. They then tell me  they got a noise complaint  AGAIN keep in mind the previous information. ALSO NOTE IT IS 2AM. I say in shock  what?? We are laying in bed, there is no noise  to which they respond  yeah, we didn't hear anything either but make sure even if you are talking that you do so QUIETLY    And this, my friends, is why no one should have to ever deal with  The D's  bullcrap or harassment.", "Date": "2014-03-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Katie", "ReviewID": "ydDdyEVgfVkf-XoSrQT_gw", "Overall": "1", "Content": "I can't even make this stuff up!!! Allow me to paint a picture for you if possible.... Imagine if you will, it's your only night during your Vegas vacation to really do it up and paint the town. You're all settled nicely into your hotel room 34 floors up, over looking Downtown Fremont. You purchase $350 in tickets to the hottest show, and make plans for dinner with some friends who happen to be visiting as well. So you're putting on you're finishing touches to make yourself Vegas ready. Hair, make up, swanky vegas style dress and heels to match. Excitement is in the air. Speaking of air...you notice something in the corner of your eye, as you glance upward to see exactly what it is... You lock eyes with a BAT... At that exact moment it does the same... and is soaring directly at your FACE!!!!  Thankfully I ducked just in time to avoid an unfortunate encounter with RABIES!! Following this, I ran into the bathroom where my friend was, I tried to place words together to explain what I had witnessed, he ran into the room, and found himself battling this uninvited pest. He called down to the front desk, and much to our surprise, the staff didn't seem too taken back by this news. We waited about 15 minutes for what we thought would be a full crew of staff to remove the bat. Instead, a man and a woman show up and are jokingly discussing how crazy it is that a bat was in our room. At this point, we have 10 mts to get to our show at the Wynn from Downtown. I inform one of the hotel employees in our room that we are now running late for our show. I then ask if they had a shuttle or someone that could give us a ride since trying to get a taxi or lyft/uber would take time we no longer had. She replied  Ahhh there's lyft . This was highly inconsiderate and we found our selves literally running down stairs to get a lyft and then from lyft to the inside of Wynn to the theater in-which , surprise... We were late! We missed a 3rd of our show. The manager on shift called my friend and apologized for the bat then offered for us  to switch rooms. We told her we had dinner plans and explained how this was now a huge inconvenience. She said she will return our resort fees. But that's all she can do. We then decided to go back to the hotel to sort this out and. Fore-go our dinner plans. We meet with the  manager , and she was somewhat rude right from the beginning. We tried explaining to her several times how this was our only night to go out, that it being 12am now and we haven't even ate yet was not our plan at all. We asked to switch rooms, a better room maybe. And she said the suites were all booked and said we would have to switch rooms that night, then again in the morning. This was ridiculous. We then asked about what she suggests we do for dinner, she said the steak house was available and that we could either do dinner there or get a new room. This then caused yet another heated exchange back and forth about how inconvenient this was and how unprofessional it is that the staff expects us to just brush this under the table and spend our one night out switching one bat infested room for possibly another.  She finally agreed to give us a $50 food/beverage credit and the new suite the next morning. I asked her to call the steak house to see if they were still open. She assured me they were. I asked her to check anyway.. And sure enough, they closed 30 minutes prior. Yet again, super unprofessional of a  manager  to not know those kinds of details. We head up to our room, switch everything out ( still shocked they even suggested us to stay in the same room as our bat guest) and then we went on our big voyage to find dinner. On our way out of the casino, long behold, the owner Derek was there, drinking at the bar near the entrance to the Fremont side. My friend saw this as a great opportunity to inform him on what had happened and how poorly his employees handled the situation, maybe it was the booze, but his response was unbelievably rude and condescending. He kept yelling at my friend to speak louder. He acted as though he didn't know about the bat laughing it off, but his VP I believe right next to him even said he heard about the incident. My friend played the video, and the owner gave him a  and.. So??  Response. It was in poor taste. Especially given this was a bat.. The largest carrier of rabies in the Western Hemisphere! Even the CDC suggest testing for anyone that was in a room with a bat given their bites, scratches or even mucus droppings all pose risk to contracting rabies. This bat didn't just fly in our room. It had been in there and probably the whole night before as we slept. It even landed on my pillow while we waited for hotel staff. For the staff to down play it and then the owner to joke about what occurred, Really speaks on the quality or lack of in this property. There's so many other places to stay in Las Vegas and Downtown.

When calling cheaptickets to refund the extra money they told me they did not receive it and it was billed by the hotel.  I asked them -since I booked through them to contact the hotel- Both them and the hotel refused to refund the extra 73.21 and told me it was due to resort fees and taxes that I was never quoted in any e-mail.

If I was going to have to fight with the hotel for the overcharge why book through cheaptickets.com at all?  The D hotel was not helpful and the manager was unavailable to settle this matter.

I gotta say that I am very impressed with all the changes going on here. If I would have rated this place 2 years ago it would have been 2 stars...and that would only be if I was in a generous mood.  They took out the bar on the first floor and  against the opposite wall built  Longbar ...which(go figure) is a really long bar that runs along the entire wall of that side of the casino. Looks really sharp! Taking the old bar out really opened up the pit and gives it a much more open feel.  You go upstairs and they still have construction tape blocking off  Vue Bar  (which overlooks Fremont Street) as well as Keno and a very small William Hill sportsbook (no races, sports only). From what I've heard, they plan on keeping this upstairs area  old school  and downstairs the  new and hip .   Don't get me wrong. Its still got its share of flaws. That parking structure for one. I always feel like I'm taking my life in my hands driving up that thing with all those blind turns.

The D grill, their in-house restaurant, has many tasty items at decent prices. The best part of it all is that you are at the center of the fremont experience.

My intent was for my invited friend and I to enjoy a brief staycation. Upon our arrival the evening of the 30th we were told that the reservation had been erroneously made for the previous night.   While far from full on a Thursday night, The D refused to honor the reservation. The D did offer to have me pay a second time for a room. Remarkably their regular rate was suggested to be $24. It turns out that the Groupon deal was no deal at all.   With my friend patiently waiting for me to check in, I asked, in light of the error, if The D would waive their resort fee. They also  refused this accommodation and suggested that I pay a second time, pay their resort fee and contact Groupon to get my first payment refunded.  Since Groupon is unavailable on any kind of an expedited basis and I was unwilling to wait at The D until 1:41 the next morning (see below), I refused The D's offer, announced the disappointing news to my friend and we left The D.

Groupon Getaways  : Perhaps the term  getaways  is a reflection of what Groupon and their partners get away with.

The D has paid Groupon to cast their business in a negative light, to create a negative experience and to create a potential customer has no plans to ever return.

I called to have a bottle of champagne delivered to a group of my girlfriends, who were in Vegas for a few days while I studied.  I wanted to do something nice for them to show them that I was there in spirit(s). Haha!  Anyway, I called and spoke with the operator, who said that she didn't know whom I should speak with to order the bottle, so she transferred me to the front desk.  The front desk told me 'we don't have amenities  and acted like I was crazy for wanting to order a bottle of champagne to be sent to a room....  Um, I just looked at the website, which shows people partying it up, and touts the fun that Bachelor and Bachelorette parties can have at The D.  What party isn't complete without people being able to send you champagne, right?  Anyway, so she asked around and then told me I would need to speak with the concierge, who might be able to find a local florist to deliver a flower arrangement for me.  Yeah....because alcohol and flowers are the same, right?  Not in my universe.  Anyway, so I got bumped over to the Concierge, who also seemed annoyed at my request.  Having worked in the hotel business myself, I was surprised at the lack of support or innovative ideas/solutions presented by the concierge at The D.  I tried to help her brainstorm by asking her if I could buy a bottle at a bar or restaurant and send up a note or something, but my ideas were dismissed in a huff.  She put me on hold, then told me she was transferring me back to the operator and that I am to tell the operator to transfer me to  Food and Beverage.   Nice....so the concierge doesn't have a phone list?  Or doesn't know how to warm transfer a call?  So I get popped back to the operator and tell her the concierge's request (literally, a game of telephone), and the operator tells me that there is no Food and Beverage department.  Ha!  She tells me that there is a  Food Department  and a  Beverage Department,  of which I chose to be transferred to the latter.  After being transferred, I spoke with someone in the Beverage Department, who did not know how to process my request, so he found a co-worker named Anthony, who was happy to help me (at last).  He took down my information and I asked that the bottle be delivered between 5:00-6:00 p.m. to coincide with my friends' arrival time.  In the morning, I got a text from my friend, asking if I had sent them champagne?  Apparently, it was delivered at 2:00 a.m., and when they told the man that they didn't order it, he shrugged his shoulders and walked out, and they were very confused because there was no information on the order and they thought there had been a mix-up.    So, long story short, their customer service has a lot to brush up on, and I hope that they do since all good hotels and casinos should know how to  keep the champagne flowing.

Escalators to the 2nd floor casino, more intimate, separate bar with friendly bartenders, good service.  2nd floor cafe-excellent food, I had one of the breakfast platters, good prices. 1st floor there is a McDonalds, prices were better than expected. They do have a dollar menu but you have to wait for the electronic display menu to cycle to see it.  Fast service but my food was not hot.  Hotel-I would rate the hotel 2 stars, my main complaint, rooms have in-wall air conditioners like a motel that appear to be leftover from the old hotel.  Very noisy and in our room made very loud banging noises when it cycled from fan to A/C automatically every few minutes as the room cooled.  It was so loud even on  low , I had to go down to one of the shops on Fremont to buy ear plugs (best 89 cents I ever spent!)  Very small HDTV in the room, no electric outlets on any wall, no place to plug-in the iron. The bed linens and carpet appear brand new, room was very clean; fresh coat of paint on the walls.  There's a coffeemaker in the room but $2.50/cup for the K-cup coffee!   Towels in the bathroom were clean but were either very old or cheap.

We wanted to celebrate and get drunk in downtown without the need for driving or calling a cab. I love it's location as it is at the heart of the Fremont Street. From the casino, you can see people having fun at the tables and slots, and patrons having a great time at the bar. It looked it was newly renovated as the place looks contemporary and hip. Almost as if they're trying to attract a younger clientele.   The room is decent for the price I paid for. I've had rooms that I stayed in solely for the purpose of enjoying a nice looking view, with five star accommodations, but there room is nothing special apart from being super clean. It's a basic bed with a bit of a rough blanket, and a flat screen TV with very little channels.   When you walk into the room, this is where you can tell that it was an old hotel because while they did an okay job revamping the sleeping quarters, the bathroom was another story. They used bright florescent light bulbs which didn't help the interior of the room because you can just tell that they're trying to keep the place from falling apart. The counter tops were an ugly off beige color, with tiles that covered its general perimeter. Also, tiled white floors (how gross). But then again, I can't complain because I did get what I was paying for.   I was a bit concerned by the woman who helped us at the front desk as she appeared stern and annoyed to be there. I felt a bit uncomfortable being there as she seemed like she didn't want to hear any questions for the day. She was straight to the point, and seeing other front desk attendants looking a bit more cheery than her, I almost wanted to stop her from proceeding with my transaction and be helped by someone else. You get what you pay for, I guess.   I do recommend this place is you want some place to sleep for a very affordable price, but again, you get what you pay for so don't expect anything more than that.

The D offers a low priced, basic, clean, and no frills room right in the heart of the Fremont Street Experience. Good food, great high energy casino, and a hard working staff. If you are expecting the lap of luxury this place isnt for you.    That is my review, as basic and straight to the point as the hotel itself. If you are easily offended, have no sense of humor, or take yourself to serious please dont read on...  What I have learned of reviews is people are much more motivated to write a bad review than a good one. A good experience is always expected and largely goes unnoticed.  I was reading reviews here as well as other sites and noticed some common threads among the negative reviews of The D and downtown Fremont Street hotels in general.  1. Complaints of smoke smell in rooms,hallways, or casino. Despite your objections some people still choose to use this legal product knowing the health risks. If you have health issues or one of the overly sensitive people who gasp and wheeze if a person is smoking two miles upwind, a simple Google search will reveal many totally non smoking properties.  2 Complaints of the noise from Fremont Street. Freemont Steet is the heart of the late night party in Las Vegas. Famous for outdoor live bands, night clubs, and people in the street all night, sometimes making noise.  If you want to lay your delicate head on the pillow at 8 PM and expect the party to notice the do not disturb sign on your door, you picked the wrong area of town. There are many low key hotels on the Strip that cater to the 80 year old set, or old at heart.  3. Complains of a rude staff. Many of these hotels have a staff of hundreds or even thousands. I see many one star reviews based on this alone. I highly doubt there was a grand conspiracy and everyone was rude to you. Most likely one person gave you a slight (real or imagined) or didnt kiss your ass at a key moment and you decide to throw everyone under the bus.   4. Complaints about the Resort Fee.  If a person does any reseach of Vegas hotels at all were bound to come across the fact that most, not all, charge a resort fee. It may not be a good value, but you were not exactly tricked. If the extra $100-$150 sent your finances into a tail spin I can about imagine how fun your vacation was. The Four Queens doesnt charge a resort fee. You can stay there where you no doubt will find something else to bitch about.   Lastly I was not an english major and never claimed to be. Some offended egghead will find fault with my grammar and/or spelling. To be fair I did warn you not to read on.

Simply put, it is the BEST thing to happen to Las Vegas in a long time!    I had to come to Vegas to attend a friend's birthday celebration.  My friends and I decided to stay at The D because we enjoy staying in downtown and away from all the donkey tourists on The Strip.  Since the Golden Nugget's customer service has gone out the window (See my Nugget review) we decided to gamble on staying at The D....and the dice came up 7!  I have to admit I was very skeptical about staying here, having read the previous reviews about the lack of A.C., long lines for the elevators, and noisy rooms.  However I was pleasantly surprised once I checked in for the weekend.    Upon quickly dropping off my car at valet, I was SHOCKED to see NO line at the check in counter!  (This is always a big fear of mine as I have no patients, especially for tourists that like to take their sweet time chatting with the employees about nothing)  I checked in quickly and early, I made sure to request a quiet room away from Freemont St. where the party doesn't end until close to 5am.  I also requested a room close to the elevator and got my requests granted, even during a SOLD OUT weekend!  The trick to keeping your room ice cold is to keep your curtains closed during the day, this will keep the 108 degree sun from preheating the room like an oven.  The beds here are extremely comfortable and had a GREAT nights sleep every night!  There were NO lines for the elevators the entire weekend I stayed, and none of them broke down.  My stay here was EXCELLENT!    The service at The D is simply OUTSTANDING!  While other Las Vegas hotels have stopped trying, The D goes above and beyond to serve their guests and make your stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible!  I haven't been this impressed with a hotel in Vegas since The Mirage first opened.  This hotel without a doubt is one of the BEST bangs for your Las Vegas buck!    The Casino: The casino is VERY cool, young and hip!  It has a GREAT vibe throughout and the late night Go-Go dancers above the table games are a nice touch.  But perhaps the BEST part of The D's casino is the Vintage style gaming located on the 2nd floor.  This is where she sits......One of the BEST games EVER created for a Las Vegas casino......One of ONLY 3 left in existence (If you count the one sitting in an undisclosed Las Vegas warehouse).......Ladies and Gentlemen....THE SIGMA DERBY!  a.k.a. The Plastic Ponies.  One of my favorite games, and the only one that will pull me out of a Poker Room.  Yes, The D has a Sigma Derby and it is BEAUTIFUL!  In addition, the rest of the 2nd floor consists of vintage style slots and video poker machines complete with  Coin Fall .  Buckets included.  I am predicting The D will single-handedly be responsible for building up downtown Las Vegas again.    The Show: I took the guys to see the  Raack N Roll  show at The D, this was a FUN show consisting of topless female dancers with absolutely AMAZING bodies!  One of the better dance shows Las Vegas has to offer.  The Bottom Line: As I always say, Las Vegas was better when the mob ran it.  But The D is the best thing to happen to Las Vegas in a long time and is a GIANT step in the right direction!  As much as I dislike what Vegas has become, I would stay at The D again in a second, and encourage others to as well.  You will not be disappointed.

I will start with the PROS,, I was so excited I forgot to take pics but there are plenty on here. They have taken the bold Red and black  Vintage Vegas  theme ..and painted this old girl up and she is a beauty!!  Now I am not going to pretend shes perfect but the  Premium  room we booked was clean, and comfortable. We had a corner room so the views were all around. we were on the 14th floor and above the stage area and THAT was a problem. I know to ask for the other side of the hotel from now on.  We had a Jacuzzi tub...and a nice large bath room. Again, the linens, new paint and flat screened TV...made her barely recognizable from that last time we stayed there. Down stairs was beautiful! The Long Bar was nice...great service and Flair bartenders outside were awesome too. They had  dancing dealer girls  ...ehh...they were  OK ...but at least it created attention and it was fun. (HEY where are the dancing GUYS??..LOL) The D Grille was part of the makeover and served up delicious breakfasts (Which is the only meals we ate there) Service was excellent. There is a Coney Hot Dog stand downstairs that is awesome too! of course McDonalds is right on site. Everything is clean and new and most of the great slots I love were still there. Not NEARLY smokey as the old Fitz...AND it has a younger vibe all around. The greatest rehab of all was the great attitude of all employees I ran into!! Now the CONS: I already mentioned the noise level from the 14th floor was bad while the band performed....I could barely hear the TV..lol NEXT I paid extra to get a room with a refrigerator which NEVER cooled one thing...that was bad but ...I didn't complain...I should Have.. But it was a good experience! Don't get me wrong its a budget hotel so you are not getting the Wynne but you get a great deal and a great location! I never figured out what the RESORT FEE paid for. It is conveniently located to the Deuce  and Walgreens (Ahhh a familiar face) is just steps away. also...The Freemont Experience is right outside the door.", "Date": "2014-04-27", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "vacIeMqny3T9TDYIG4TyQg", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Room was filthy smoking.

It was Fitzgerald's Holiday Inn back in the mid nineties and the boulevard was quieter back then. There's no way anyone can sleep at the D Hotel without the help of meds!  Even though my room was on the 14th floor, the retro design with its popcorn walls, dark colors and bland furniture, it felt like a dungeon (though I've never stayed in one).  The casino and outside bar featuring some of the best  bartenders are worth visiting. The 2nd floor features the old slot machines and a horse race track which can only be described as something I've never seen before but it reminds me of a carni horse race game with the water guns even though it's nothing like that. You'll just have to see it for yourself if you're into vintage gaming.  We ate at the D Grill on our first day of arrival. The food is OK. The front desk gave us an expired coupon with our guest room keys so that proved useless.  This is the last time I choose to reserve a sleeping room in the downtown area. I want to play hard and be able to recoup, recover and do it all over. It's not possible when my sleep is disrupted.  The bands don't stop performing, the new construction for Slotzilla begins at 11PM.... it's Halloween every night on Fremont Street.   Sin city has turned into crazy town; at least in this part of Vegas. I'm a glutton for punishment. I appreciate that there are 2 faces of this city.

First of I want to say that everyone who isn't a manager is AWESOME they are polite, friendly, and genuinely seem happy to make sure you are having a good time. They got the Hotel my 2 stars!While we were there we attempted to use the WiFi but it asked me for my credit card, and then I looked at the little packet where I got my key cards and it said WiFi available  ask for rates. So I assumed I was mistaken about the free WiFi. Then apon check which I attempted on the TV it said I owed almost $70.00 Dollars in resort fees. No don't get me wrong I am very used to resort fees but I am used to them in better hotels and you actually get services for your money. I did call down to the  guest services  and they informed me that the resort fee covered Free Wifi (WTF), Free local calls (who doesn't have a cell phone?), and the coupons I got with my key card. Seriously $22.00/per day+tax for Wifi I couldn't get into, calls NOONE needs to make and coupons which I believe was bogo fora lame show, and something about Keno. (Who plays keno when you under 90?) When I called down to see what could be done I got a very snotting -well your checking out-- so why bother being nice to you now ? attitude. I finally called back and talked to someone else who was nice enough to remove one of the charges. I am still not very pleased. I don't mind when I have to pay for things but I expect something in return.  The casino is small and after about an hour I felt like I played everything. (A lot of repeating games) Also the D Club (the players club) and the gift store no where near the room elevators, neither are the bathrooms. It would be nice to walk out of the elevator and find such things right away, that way I could spend more money. I actually went across to the Fremont's gift shop to buy something because I couldn't find ours. The ELEVATORS are not for the faint of heart. They are a little small (which is okay) but add to that the fact that they shake and rattle as they go down. I want to gamble in Vegas just not with my life. We did stop in to the Coney Island Hot Dogs they were ok ... not great, not bad, just ok. Like getting hot dog at the mall, again staff there amazing. I couldn't find the other restaurant there. The Room was very nice and the maid was great. I would have preferred to have a table in there vs a desk. We had to eat sitting on our beds. The pool it is a salt pool which is great, it was warm enough for me to get in a plus, the Jacuzzi was nice, but there was a note in the room letting you know that towels are at the pool and that you shouldn't take them from the room. But when I got to the pool at noon on Friday, there was a rack for towels but no towels and there aren't any employee's right there, in fact you have to cross the driveway where you valet your car to get there (literally dodging cars. and man the pool needs at least a mini bar, and drink service. Also it closes at 7pm which is a bummer because I like to dip in the Jacuzzi after a night of gambling.  All in all it was okay but I think next year when I go I will be choosing a different Hotel and Will not be returning to the D.", "Date": "2014-06-10", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Megan", "ReviewID": "Bksmt9lGT2UDo1T5cEez1g", "Overall": "1", "Content": "The D has great decor and a fun bar, BUT, they thought it was a good idea to have a stage set up (permanently) right outside one side of the hotel.

Inside, you have one wild bar scene, replete with a BEVY OF GO-GO DANCERS and bartenders who juggle bottles and are quick to jump on the counter and pour a shot straight into your mouth (usually for a lady).

We go to valet the car, and valet guys are too busy talking to each other to do their job. Not one valet came to open the car doors, and I had to pull the luggage out of my car myself... not a great start. We had checked in earlier (locals having a staycation) so we didn't need to go to the front desk, but that didn't stop the one over-zealous employee YELLING at us 3x that we needed to go to the front desk rather than pointing us in the direction of the elevators to get to the room, as we had asked him. After finding our own way, we get into the room, and were absolutely dumbfounded. We PAID for a room upgrade, and when we walked in, our room was literally on par with a Motel 8 that had a 30th floor. Apparently they figured upgrade meant moving to a higher floor. View of roof tops and not much more (definitely no view of the strip, Fremont, or anything that resembled Las Vegas), no refrigerator, no coffee machine, bathtub was barely big enough for a normal size human being to sit in, and no additional seating other than the desk/dresser/tv stand chair (room looks nothing like the one posted... maybe that's their  SUITE ). Seriously. Motel 8. The rest of the stay was much the same, but made worse upon being told that their pool was closed. This turned into a benefit because they sent us to the Downtown Grand, who had a GREAT pool, sparing a guaranteed disappointing swim in theirs. As a local who just wanted to have fun on Fremont, and having stayed in many, many of the other strip properties, I found The D among the worse... 3 stars is really too good of a rating.
