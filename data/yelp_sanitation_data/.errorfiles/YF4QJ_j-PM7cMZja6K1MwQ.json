Much cleaner and less ratchet than Marquee and Wet Republic. Probably 'cause it's more expensive. Never expect guys to get in for free here. My friends split up the ladies and gentlemen so ladies get in free (usually with drink tickets) while the gentlefolk purchase tickets. Depending on who the DJ is, expect tickets to be anywhere from $40 - $100. This past weekend, lockers were $45 but if everyone in your group wants to go in the water, it's a great investment.   The bartenders are super chill too. Even though drinks are $$$$, most of the bartenders I dealt with poured pretty heavily. Pro tip: I prefer the bar closest to the entrance or all the way in the back since there are actual lines instead of everyone pushing and shoving to the front like at the main bar.", "Date": "2016-06-14", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ayumi", "ReviewID": "nxnW2EyKK3bUhAvbYCJtvg", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Went to Encore Beach Club on Sunday afternoon.   There was a huuuge line of people waiting to get in..luckily we were on the guest list! Honestly, I recommend you people find a guest list. You go through a separate line, they have ice water for you, and it's a lot shorter and quicker. They're very well organized. Loved it. Waited maybe 10 minutes.   Got in, item check, and off we went! It was really nice, and Calvin Harris was performing that day. We overheard that their cabanas are 6k. I'm sorry but..holy fuckin shiz..that's ridiculous. They have these SMALL circle couches there as well, and that is 3k. And if you want to have a seat at the bar that's only yours...1k. RE-DONKULOUS. Sorry, I ain't ballin' like that.   Anway, we make our way to the pool, and it felt good once you get in...but after sitting in there for a while, it's a little disgusting. It's just luke warm because of all the other people chillin. I felt a little uncomfy just standing in the water.   Only stayed for about an hour. It really was nothing exciting to me. Just normal.

We had bottle service in the shade right in front of the blackjack tables and across the pool from the DJ so that was definitely cool.  If you don't want to pay $$ for drinks, just spend some time at the blackjack tables and take advantage of free drinks.  We went on a Saturday when David Guetta was set to perform.  We got inside at 11:30am, (and whoa the line was already really long by then for general admin/GL) claimed our tables right across the pool from the DJ booth.  There are few platforms in the pool but they only allow women on them LOL.  A guy got up while we were in the pool and security told him to get down.  The pool gets as deep as 4+ feet near the center.  Towels were free which is a plus, considering we were at a pool party the day before which charged $5 for towel rental.  And music from David Guetta was awesome.  So many people hyped this to be THE ultimate day party destination in Vegas and I can't really argue with them.

Yes, this can be hobag and douchebag central. Consider that your free entertainment, and one of the few things you can get for free here. Once again, this is not a walk-in kind of place, though it's apparently not hard to get on a list of some sort if you want to.  In principle, I'm opposed to any place that invites you in but 1. has a low human-to-chair ratio, and 2. expects you to pay a ridiculous premium for utilizing said chairs. On that level, I'm fighting a losing battle with places like Encore. But if you take it for what it is, and are willing to play the game, you can still have a great time.

Beautiful set-up. 2 different pools (that aren't attached, but super close together) There are cabanas and lounge areas, but of course you have to pay for those.   The only downfall was there is basically no where to put your stuff. You always have to have someone watching your things/on patrol because you will have to leave it by a planter or something, unless you want it getting drenched poolside. Also, the places to sit & hang out are very limited. If you get their early you can snag a spot along the edge of the pool, if not....plan on finding a party to sit with, stand/sit in the pool or just dance around like no ones watching.

I think I'm just too old to thoroughly enjoy the beach club scene.  I knew I wouldn't enjoy it as general admission (I don't know if I would have enjoyed it when I was 21 either) so my party opted to make reservations several weeks in advance for a cabana.  We got a  deal  through a VIP host but were still shelling out a hefty sum to have a bit of shade and respite from the crowds.  The contract said to arrive by 11:30am to honor our reservation and also stated that if we didn't show, we would be charged $1500 for a missed reservation.  The majority of my group showed up at 11am (when they opened) and proceeded to wait in line for almost an hour.  The line wasn't that long but the promoters outright ignored us and attended to people around us.  When someone finally acknowledged us, our reservation was completely messed up and in order for us to get something similar to our original reservation (but still a downgrade), we had to pay an extra $1000 over our original price.  I nearly lost it when they continued to make us wait...I vocalized my frustration and we were finally escorted to our cabana.  What a disappointment!!!  The cabanas range from $3000 to $10,000 and it's basically just a room and an adjacent day bed overlooking the beach club.  I was grateful to have a cool place to rest when I couldn't handle the heat any longer and didn't want to risk catching an STD in the pool that my friend deemed  people soup.   We ordered copious amounts of food, drinks, bottles of water, ice cream, magnums of champagne...everything we could to meet the minimum and cover our cabana fee.  It was the definition of opulence and wastefulness.  I felt a little bit like Marie Antoinette.  Our VIP host found me after we were settled in our cabana and apologized for the confusion but could do nothing about the extra $1000 or the down-graded cabana.  It was an empty apology.  She was contrite with me but gave my husband attitude, saying that she was embarrassed because we ruined her relationship with the people at the club.  I found this to be completely unprofessional and if she had just shown up on time, she could have saved her own relationships.  I really expected better service from a hotel like Encore.

I was thinking since I've spent so much money on the table that I would have got in a lot faster. Absolutely not.  Not only did I wait an hour- an hour and 15 minutes to get into the line, it was under the hot sun in 100 degree weather. I literally felt like I was going to pass out at one point. There was no shade for the table line, no water, nothing.   But the line next to me which was general admission was all shaded and going so fast.  AND my 2 friends who were on a guest list, waited maybe 5 minutes in line before they got in and got in for free.   How is it that someone who paid a couple thousand dollars for a table has to wait over an hour to get in while people who are getting in free, don't have to wait at all.

We were a party of 6 dudes, so it seemed like the best way to get in. I believe we had to order three bottles, and our bill came to maybe $300 a piece. It was well worth it. Our feet were basically in the water the whole time, we had great views of the entire club, a smoking hot waitress keeping our drinks full, and a very cool security guard looking out for us.   The scenery was unreal, the music was good, a couple of celebrity sightings (if you are into that, I'm not, but they were there) and the warm sun, and the day just got better as it went on.   My only negative comment would be that they charge $30 for sunscreen, so bring your own.

Towels available as well - big Plus!  * Pool, Lilly Pad table service.  Day couches, day beds, upstair and downstairs cabanas.    Cost increases accordingly.  The cabanas have a great view of the action but they are not in the action.  Cabanas are best if you and your group don't want to be bothered.  We had a daybed near the steps to the tables and pool.  Great spot as a lot of foot traffic, pool access.     Also - the type of Bottle Service you get determines what line for entry you are in.  General Admin. naturally the longest line.  * Restrooms available near entrance and on other side of venue.  (1 restroom at WET)  * Tables in the covered area for those that want to play some cards / gamble.  *  Unfortunately this past Saturday I was there for 15 minutes and left.  Guetta was a joke, super weak music.  My Soundcloud profile is more up to date and has more heat.  *  Sunday - Otto Knows took a while to warm up closed out HUGE.  Really a great set up for Avicii.  * Sunday - Avicii absolutely blew me (and everyone else) away by opening up with Levels.  After that it - Nothing.

I was impressed in soooo many ways. I went to Surrender and thought it was ok, but as a daytime pool party Enocre Beach Club is off the hook!  I first attended the pool party the 4th of July weekend last year and was appalled when I was asked to pay cover. Moi and my girlfriend? Cover? I complained but sucked it up, forked over 30 dollars (they were charging guys 100) and 20 minutes later was glad I did!  Stripper poles in the water help with potential slippage and make for good pictures you won't post on Facebook. KASCADE spinning was the BEST! Everyone was happy, friendly, and had a killer body. Ladies: wear your high heels with your snazzy (think gold metal rings, shiny metallic colors, bedazzed sequined) bikini to lengthen you out. Don't worry, a cover up and a few drinks will take the edge off the social comparison if that's more your speed.   As a note, the last time I went here I had to drive back to the OC after, and had only 1 drink. Even so, I still had one of the best times of my club-going life! The music and crowd is so good, you can get your natural high (wait, is that even legal in Vegas?) on and maybe even save some money on drinks.  A must-visit during pool party season!

Not only did this lovely lady put us on her list, but also promised to waive the cover charges for our guys as well.  Awesome. We exchanged numbers, said our good byes and hoped for the best in the morning. The next day after a long, late breakfast we all cabbed it over.   By a stroke of absolute luck we all made it into the beach club for free.    No joke, it's beautiful. The tables, the people, the pool, heck even the drinks are gorgeous.  The only ugly part was the large, angry old man posted guard at the door.  Now I don't feel entitled to get into things for free just because I am a lady, though the perks are nice. I'll pay for  things when it is appropriate. But when I see my name posted on the list with my +3 shining out like a beacon I expect to be treated with at least a little decency and respect.  After pointing this out to the bouncer again, this ridiculous ass rudely told us to  wait here,   turned to the girl behind the counter and said   I want THESE people to pay.   Um, what? What about US people?   While he was arguing loudly with the girl behind the counter about whether or not we owe money one of the hosts pulled us aside, apologized and ushered us in. What a mess. I'm all for the perks and promotions of Vegas but rudeness is never acceptable.    All in all I feel the same way about  club pools  as I do about the clubs themselves.

My one complaint about this venue is that the floors are VERY slippery when wet...which is why they constantly have staff members sweeping the water away.

I was being prohibited from going back into gamble. I guess some moron thought it was a great idea to prevent the pool party people from going in the casino. I'm sure all the gamblers inside would hate to see attractive girls walking around in bikinis. What a stupid idea that is.

My girlfriend and I came here sunday of memorial weekend because we love Kaskade so there's nothing better than to check out the new pool and enjoy great music. We came around noon-ish there wasn't much of a line yet, but being two girls it wasn't hard to get pulled out and shuttled in.   As soon as you walk in it's as impressive an entrance as walking into XS. It looks like an oasis. Like previous entries there are sophisticated dancing poles lol with water raining down them there are about 3 of them at the entrance, middle and at the other end. When you walk in they hand you a towel right away and offer to walk it to your destination!! I like that kind of service although we did deny lol. There aren't any beach chairs that take up unnecessary room there are are beds both in the pool and outside of it. There is a second story with cabana rooms similar to XS and for once I wouldn't want to be located there away from the pool and the wonderful sun.   There is 3 pools but it looks like one big one but has 2 walkways so you can check out what's going on and cut through to the other side. Ohh and most importantly the pools are heated so no worries on headlights and shrinkage, can't ask for anymore than that!! One side of the pool is where the DJ is located and the other is where you can gamble etc.   Anyway, back to the main point I dunno how they managed it but seriously I have never been to a place where it was a ratio of 90% beautiful people, 8% normal and 2% uglies. The day we came could really give a girl a complex whether it was about lack of 'twins', tummy isn't flat enough or the bikini was covering too much skin! My girlfriend and I ogled at both guys and girls lol. It was fun and definitely the fest for the eyes! Management I love how you let people in you did a great job! And to note they didn't pack this place it was full but not crowded or uncomfortable. My friends came here at 4pm and the doors were closed they were no longer letting anyone else in. Ohh and there is re-entry here like at XS.   The music was fabulous of course,  dancing in the pool and enjoying the sun is my idea of a great time!! This is the best pool party I have been to, it totally redefines my expectations of pool parties!! I will be coming back here as often as I'm in Vegas this summer which I hope to be at least 2x a month this summer!!   Ohhh btw, I had a great watermelon margarita make sure to try it!! And they had a stoli blueberry lemonade that looked yummy but never made it to the bar to order it.  All my friends thought this was just XS opened during the day no it isn't it's a whole new other place and XS is still closed during the day just in case you were curious.

Traditionally, when I go to Vegas, I'll catch a show, eat at buffets and nice restaurants, play a little poker, and walk around the strip with my wife and friends.  They do Vegas in a completely different way.  We got in Friday afternoon and checked in to the Palms Place hotel.  We then went to Ditch Friday and got trashed.  The rest of the day was spent in recovery for many of us.  But Saturday, we went to Encore.  We had reserved a cabana for the 13 of us on the lower level with quick access to the stairs leading to the pool.  The cabana had a HD TV, ceiling fan, volume controls for music inside, a long couch with some accompanying ottoman chairs and tables, a fridge, a safe, some lounging furniture in front, and a balcony facing the strip in back.  I don't remember what the minimum was for the cabana...I think it was $2000.  We ended up spending over $4000 because each bottle is about $1000.  $1000 for a bottle of vodka!!!  WTF?!!!  Again, this is not the Vegas that I know, so the outrageous prices for the bottles blew my mind.  Accompanying the bottles is a constantly replenishing set of mixers (OJ, cranberry, tonic, pineapple, etc) and ice brought by very attentive staff who are dedicated to your cabana.    The food and bottled waters were average normally priced.  I.e. a chicken quesadilla is around $10 to $12.  A burger is around the same.  We all got food early on when we arrived around 11am and the food was good.  Now let's talk about the reason why you come to one of these places: the pool.  I will say, having been to Ditch Friday and Rehab (the next day), Encore easily has the best  scenery.   The pool is not huge, but they don't stuff lots of people into the beach club like they do at Rehab.  I don't know how they maintain  scenery  control, but they do a good job.  Lining the pool are bars, cabanas (some with private pools with a glass wall that faces the main pool), a grill, and a bunch of chairs/lounging furniture.  One of my friends there bought two vodka tonics at the pool bar and paid $60!!! $60!!!!  I'm so cheap.  The club closes down at about 6 or 7pm, so you can be there for a good 6 to 7 hours, but they keep it bumping the whole time.  Summary: Great staff.  Good food at decent prices.  Great beach club  scenery .  DJ is good.  Cabanas are nice and amenity-filled, but bottles are $1000 each.  Prepare to spend a lot of money on alcohol. Period.  Will never go back there probably because it's just not worth it to me, but they do a good job with making the club fun for the guests.", "Date": "2010-08-25", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Emi", "ReviewID": "Io69_21TL8-qoa-GalfoSA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "#Vegas #EncoreBeach  Encore Waitress:  Are you ladies okay?

My girlfriend and I decided to head to Encore Beach Club on our first day in Las Vegas as she got us on the guest list. We expected some people hanging out by the pool and what we got was a movie called: BIKINI DEBAUCHERY 2.

If you can't swim, don't worry, there are lots of flotation devices (aka fake boobs) everywhere. We decided in order to acclimate ourselves to this party we really needed a drink or two.   Be prepared to pay through the nose for drinks and food. My friend's Bud Light was $12 and my bloody mary was $19. Holy tomato juice Batman!

Got pre-sale tickets to Avicii because that was our main reason for going to Vegas and didn't want to risk not getting in waiting in line. On our way to the airport to get out there, we got an email from the ticket company saying that Avicii (although already retired but finishing his residency in Vegas) decided to cancel the rest of his shows and we were the first week that was impacted.   Email said we could still go (obviously) or use the ticket for XS to see Skrillex. We were staying at Encore (and the hotel knows nothing about what goes on at the clubs) so we went to the concierge and told them I just wanted my money back. They didn't care and said it was a 3rd party we booked thru so there was nothing they could do and gave us a phone number to try to call (which didn't work)....even though we bought the tickets on the Encore website.  So, my suggestion is to get your tickets at the concierge and not risk buying them ahead of time in case someone cancels. It might be a few dollars more but worth it because from everything I heard, the Beach Club is amazing.

The staff here is out of control, in the worst way possible. Rude. Arrogant. Horrible...... I. Can't. Even.   Basically, one of the bouncers here (Josh) snapped one of our friend's ID's bc he thought it might be a fake. Unfortunately, this was NOT a fake ID. And this friend was visiting from out of state. But not only did he damage a government issued ID, he tried to brush it off as if it was not a problem and told us that the TSA would still let them fly, but we couldn't come into the club. When we asked to speak to the manager of the club so that we could get a written statement, some random guy who was NOT the manager but said he was (Christopher), came over to try and work out the situation. Ultimately we went to the hotel staff and spoke with the general manager to try and work out a solution. It took 2+ hours to get written statements and supposedly Metro was contacted but never showed. The whole experience just left me with a bad taste in my mouth.   Here is ultimately my problem. Not only did this guy damage property that was not his, there were NO repercussions, and not only that, there was NO SOLUTION. First off, there is no reason that he should have broken the ID. I mean, aren't there scanners that can check for fake IDs? But fine, it happened. Then what?!?! You're just gonna leave it and NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT? We didn't do anything wrong, you did. FIX IT.

They've got a few pools so until it got later there was plenty of space & wasn't overcrowded with people. It's a very well kept beach club with tasteful decor. The people working were friendly, good looking, & helpful. Also when Skrillex was on & shot out streamers there was a cleaner sweeping it up two seconds later... which I thought was hilarious but good thinking on the club's part with all of the drunk people likely to trip on it.

Got there a little early to get free entry/drink tickets and waited about 1-2 hours for RL Grime to go on.

How I love u Encore. Let me count the ways...  1: The looks: It's beautifully appointed and the decor is in line with the swankyness you expect from a hotel like the Wynn. They make the Vegas pool party shitshow classy. Yes, it's possible. It's clean, and doesn't get too filthy by the end of the day. The bathrooms are well maintained throughout the day. The beautiful people play here-get those wedges and itsy bitsy bikinis ready girls.   2: The service: it's outstanding! We had a lilly pad for the day and our adorable server was attentive and went the extra mile. We misunderstood the details of what is and isn't allowed on the lilly pads and what was included with our prepaid tab-like no food! Damn! She was awesome, and between her, the management, and Red Carpet VIP, they let us order anyways. She set up our orders nearby on a tray table and was a total sweetheart about it too. The pool boys set up our towels and waters and even straightened our long line of wedges on the edge throughout the day. The bouncers are on point but fun, they'll take a pic for you if you ask politely.   3: The Menu: Our group consisted of ladies with many a food allergy. Encore provides an awesome allergen menu. Allergic to gluten, dairy, shellfish, and nuts? Well one of our besties is too, and she was happy as a clam she couldn't eat with this option. It was actually one of the main reasons we picked this pool. When all the girls in your group are happy, it's a better day by far!   4: I saw a guy wearing Hulk Hands. Nuff said.

Great music, drinks, and a fun and energetic crowd for a fun pool party. I went on the summer, so it was sunny and crowded, but the great energy and vibe made up for it.   The line to get in is hectic and so disorganized, which was the most frustrating part of the experience. You will wait in a line regardless of being on the guest list or having pre-sale ticket. Our bachelorette party had to wait almost 45 min to get to the door.  We were in line to get in, but security kept re-organizing the rope and our group basically kept getting pushed back to the end of the line.  Once inside, your bags were searched and checked. I recommend not bring anything more than your phones, ID, and cards. They also make you throw away packets of gum.    The venue itself is very spacious and well designed. There is a large pool in the center of the venue, surrounded with daybeds, cabanas, tables and a stage in front of the pool.  If you get there early, there is no need to buy a cabana or daybed, as there are plenty of spots to lay your towels and flip flops around the pool (granted if you have a friend to guard your spot all day!). Towels are provided and you can purchase a locker for $20.    We ended up making friends with a bachelor party who had bottle service at their cabana and we drank for free all day.

We all had a great time at the pool party and would definitely come back again.", "Date": "2015-09-10", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "HjdPw_fvpLda9x2RmsgIkA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "For as much as we love both Vegas & dance music (a match made in heaven), it nonetheless took us quite a while to visit Encore Beach Club - which by & large seems to be touted as the gold standard for daytime partying in LV.   The experience was mostly thumbs-up, with a few observations for improvement:  _____________  + Even in less-than-stellar weather, the venue itself is very beautiful. It carries the same cream & red color scheme found inside the Encore casino and extends that same aesthetic into an outdoor venue. The feel is very upscale & posh - a significant upgrade over the  rebranded YMCA pool  look featured at Wet Republic, EBC's supposed rival.   + There's a fair amount of plush seating to lounge out at, regardless of if you've got table reservations or not. These seats are comfortable & well-padded, too, and other partygoers were more than willing to make room to accomodate our crew and I, which I greatly appreciated. Surprisingly, this minor touch of practicality is a major upgrade over virtually any other dayclub in Vegas except Drai's; (again looking at you, Wet Republic) more often than not, free seating is nonexistent altogether.  - While I'm on the subject of practicality - I was a little disappointed to learn that Encore doesn't offer complimentary tap water to club patrons. Marquee & Drai's remain the only two dayclub properties to offer this common convenience - and honestly, it shouldn't be that much of a debate! If you keep people hydrated, they're only going to be more inclined to drink more alcohol...and more alcohol = more profit! Given, these kinds of places are all about the bottom line, so I doubt this policy will change in the near or distant future.  + On the flipside of things, EBC does provide complimentary towel service, which slightly offsets the financial hit that you'll take from dropping wads of cash on drinks & Fiji all day. Not an equivalent savings, but I suppose that it helps...  Beers were about $12 each. I suppose that that's standard Vegas party pricing, so not much to complain about on my end.   _____________  - It was a pretty big shocker for our group to learn that Alesso wouldn't be performing as scheduled (and this was quite an unfortunate turn of events given that we planned pretty much our entire first day in Vegas around seeing him). Through a brief chat with the club's staff, I learned that it's really not uncommon for headlining talent to cancel at EBC...sad to say the least.  The DJ who subbed in for him did an okay job, but we had already shifted our focus away from the dancefloor. Thus, I can't really comment on the overall experience of seeing a headlining DJ at EBC.   _____________  + We had the fortune of befriending some cabana-goers during here; the cabana experience really felt like the royal treatment, to say the least.   For one thing, they're quartered off separately from the rest of the venue. Looking for a little privacy? Boom, you got it. There's even balcony access, enabling you to indulge in a view that overlooks the street traffic passing by Encore. Due to the casino's position a bit away from the core of the Strip, there's not much to look at out there - but the fresh air and elevated view really make you feel like you're getting the VIP experience.   Drinks were seldom left unfilled, and the cabana had a steady stream of liquor/beer/bottled water at all times. Service was very attentive and prompt. The cabanas also feature plenty of plush, comfy seating for when your tired legs need a breather from the dancefloor.   ____________  This really feels like a grown-ups' sort of pool party. Minimal shenanigans, good vibes, and a sophisticated approach towards dayclubbing.

The  place is huge and the pool is amazing. I really enjoyed the night pool party with all of the fun inflatable toys. Definitely felt like a kid again! The day pool party was really fun, too, and the atmosphere was completely different from night to day. All of the party goers were very friendly (bad crowds always ruin potentially great venues). It was also awesome that they were showing the World Cup game on the big screen before Macklemore came out. Another great thing is that you are given free towels! Every person got 2 free towels for the night party and 1 free towel for the day party. It's nice to know they don't charge for that. Also, great security. It does slow down the line when girls needs to get everything thoroughly checked, but at least I know I'm safe.  Three things I have to complain about.  -They don't give free water. It's $8 for a tiny bottle of Fiji water (why the fancy water anyways?). I hate when clubs make you pay for water especially when it's 115 degrees out. Marquee gives free iced tap water which I'll totally take over fancy bottled water.  -The staff working Encore were bitchy. One woman who worked the lines gave attitude when I asked a very reasonable question. The people at bag check were rude, too. Customer service is everything, and it leaves a bad taste in my mouth when I meet people like this, but I try to not let that affect my experience with the pool itself. -I was at the night pool party the night before the day pool party. When you check in bags, they give you a trash bag to put your stuff in. The goal is to make sure the trash bag can be closed up or else they will make you pay double for an extra bag. Here's the catch: The night pool party gave me a giant bag, and the day pool party gave me a noticeably smaller bag. The 6 of us were able to fit all of our things in one bag at the night pool party with tons of room to spare, but had to get 2 separate bags for the day pool party. Also, they make you close it up in front of them, and if you cut it close, they stand there and contemplate for a good 10 seconds whether or not they want to charge you $20 instead of $10.   Overall, I had fun both times, so I'm just going to the let the little things I complained about pass.

Also, some people in the group bought food so I got to eat chicken strips and fries, which were DELISH and not that overpriced, considering.

I kicked off my weekend Friday afternoon with a group of 19 girls for a bachelorette party.  We had initially expected to shell out at least 1K + tax and gratuity on 2 lily pads at $500 each, but Julian, the host hooked us up PHAT.  We got a daybed (already 1K in itself), two pool lounge chairs and a comfy couch poolside for a mere $500 minimum.  Now the good thing is, it doesn't cost any money to rent these spaces.  You simply have to buy all the food and drink you can using said minimum.    Mixed drinks can range anywhere from $14-$17 Pitchers are $85 Finger foods (quesadillas, chips, fries) are around $15  Pricey, but what else can be expected in Vegas? The food was tasty, but the drinks were horribly watered down.  Sugar water, I'd say.  Fridays are chill.  The crowd is great, no douche bags like tao beach and everyone is super friendly.  It's definitely not a crazy pool party with drunkasses grinding in the water.  Lots of girls are getting their tan on, a little mingling, etc.  It was actually quite relaxing.  The decor is swanky with a summery orange and white theme and a stripper pole in the middle of the pool.

And even more so when something as awesome as MAD BLOCK PARTY is visiting!  I was skeptical. The night before we went, I had lost my phone at Marquee, so I was in no mood to party, but I decided to walk with my friends to EBC even though initially, I wasn't planning on going. But when we got there, I just couldn't help myself and hopped in line with them.  Definitely do NOT regret that decision.   This was hands down one of the BEST experiences from that Vegas trip and I would go back in a heartbeat.  We went with a large group, so booking a lily pad ( table ) was definitely a must. We racked up quite a bit in charges, but again, so so worth it!  Random thoughts: - The water looks  cleaner  here than it did at Drais. I don't know if it's because the people here are cleaner (lolsies) or if it's because they do a better job of cleaning the water, but there was a noticeable different between the water here and at Drais-- the water at EBC actually looked clear... - Go early because it gets crowded and make sure you stay hydrated! One of my friends got heat exhaustion from spending so much time in the sun! - The bag-check line here is relatively fast compared to some other places, though that being said, it's still a pain and slower than I would like. - I love the  lifeguards  here. While they are probably actually legit lifeguards, part of me still believes that they are just attractive models who have been paid to dance in the lifeguard chairs.  tl;dr: EBC gets 5 stars from me because I had such an amazing time here!

We purchased our tickets a few weeks in advance to ensure seamless entry into EBC. The club is glamorous, and you will be surrounded by young and beautiful people (especially the lifeguards and hostesses) who are all down for a good time. That's right ladies... it's time to take out that cute and sexy bikini that you've been hesitant to wear to your family vacays! We met some friendly people and chilled with them throughout the day.  + Arrive EARLY: I cannot stress this enough. There is very limited room for general admission ticket holders - you have the option of either sitting poolside or on one of the few circular benches. There are lily pads, daybeds, and cabanas that you can rent for an insane fee - I'd probably only rent one if I was going for a bachelorette party. We showed up at 11:10 am and there were practically no empty poolside spots. We walked around a few times and were super lucky to find a spot. I honestly don't know how other people who came later in the afternoon even found a spot; it was crowded like packed sardines. If I were to go again, I'd be in line a little before 11:00 am so that I could be one of the first few in the club.  + Checking bags: They thoroughly search bags and WILL throw out any food and liquids (even my small contact solution bottle). The security guy who was checking my boyfriend's slim backpack told us that the have to check our bag. We went over to the window and I asked the girls how much it was, expecting it to be $10 based on other Yelp reviews. However, they told me it was $25. I asked if we could just take our bag in instead, and they said it was fine. Once we got settled by the pool, I noticed that it was pretty much only girls who had totes or purses. No other guys had bags. It could be possible that they allow girls to bring their handbags, but guys are forced to check them. Bring as little as possible and don't bring a cute bag that you don't want to get wet.  + Towels: EBC gives a towel to each guest. This towel pretty much will serve as your butt cushion and seat saver when you sit on the edge of the pool. Don't expect it to dry you off at any point during the day, as it will be drenched from water overflowing from the pool anyways.  + Waterproof phone pouch: I HIGHLY recommend that you purchase a waterproof case for your precious phone before you leave for Vegas. You can get one for ~$10 online. Not worrying about your phone getting wet and being able to take photos while in the pool was amazing, especially if you are like me and take a gazillion pics.   + Food & Drankss: Drinks range from ~$15-$20. They do have a little concession stand, but you have to eat your food in a designated area. Our chicken tender platter with fries was $18. You might have to tag team and watch your friends' belongings as you take turns to grab a bite to eat - you don't want to risk someone taking your spot near the pool (patrolling security remove drenched towels aka seat savers later in the day).  + David Guetta: He did not come out to perform until about 3:30 pm, even though the pool party started at 11:00 am. Everyone went wild and was dancing once he began his set! So much fun. I loved that you could go close to the stage to see him.  Checkin' out EBC when there is a headliner is a MUST while you are in Vegas!

Now let me warn you, that my experience is from being in my early 20's with a group of only girls (both huge factors when you're out in Vegas)  The first time I went here, we were on the guest list with a promoter that we didn't know too well, and he conveniently forgot to mention that we had to be at the club before 1 in order to get in for free. We had friends with a cabana inside, so we coughed up the money ($30!) and got in.  Once in however, the place was a blast, good music, lots of people. ( We went to another hyped up beach club, and it wasn't nearly as fun because there weren't as many people and therefore it wasn't as much fun)  We went a second time and got in with a promoter that we knew a lot better, he met us outside and walked us in, which was amazing, though not everyone is going to get this kind of treatment. Just be sure if you're on a list, to know what time you need to be there by, and it always helps to have one person be the contact with said promoter.  This time we made friends with the group that had rented the Ultra Lounge (great decision, free drinks all day)   Now, reading some of the comments, the drinks are expensive and so is the cover.

First of all, forget coming here as general admin. Seriously if you think about all the alcohol and food you will consume throughout the day, why not pool together on a couch with 4 others? A couch can fit 5 people, and I m sure $500 FB is very easy to blow through over the course of the day. Dave Pappas is the contact for all your EBC needs. Please pm me or Peter if you guys need the info.   Now the pool party itself:  Kaskade Sundays is simply amazing. He pretty much tore the roof off, and I can not think of a better pool venue aside from Wet that is good for house DJs.  We got in a little later than normal because of check out day, but one of our buddies was able to hold our couch for us. The location was absolutely excellent. I believe it was (#503). This is right across the center stage dance floor and next to the gambling area.  Pretty much prime territory as far as location goes.  The service was absolutely outstanding. I couldn't help but notice that EBC has more staff working the pool venue than any other pool parties I have been to that weekend. There is also no room for shenanigans. If you are guy trying to get up on the water stripper pole, within seconds you will be warned and tossed out. Also there were sweepers all around the walk way areas drying off the floor so people won't slip.   Our waitress was also very friendly in answering our questions and delivering our orders accurately and on time.  To summarize everything, EBC is definitely focuses on the class factor of pool parties. I can quote Dave P that they don't welcome the steroid tatted out jersey shore style crowd. The party itself does have its moments, but even on a Kaskade Sunday, it's not as wild as Wet Republic.  I personally think this is a good change of pace. In Vegas we officially have a 1A (Wet Republic) and 1B (EBC) in pool parties, and I would go to either depending on what I m feeling that day.", "Date": "2010-09-07", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "C", "ReviewID": "qvTKANeljMYBfknhw8bzPA", "Overall": "2", "Content": "$40 cover on a dead Friday night?

Seems like the reviews are either totally in awe, or in complete disdain of this place. I think for the majority of those who gave this place poor reviews, they simply aren't familiar with Vegas/pool parties or didn't bother to educate themselves a little before coming. Let me explain why this place is top notch in my book.   It's expensive. Like, really expensive. So just know that and accept it out of the gate. Don't go to the best pool party in Vegas and then give a crappy review because the waffle fries were $12 and you think that is an abomination. You know why stuff is expensive? Because it's WORTH it. Supply and demand. A place like Encore Beach Club is pricey - but don't view it as a bad thing. That keeps the riff raff out. I prefer to organize a group to split the costs and do my homework ahead of time at a nice place vs going to a less expensive place with a rougher crowd.  I also read a LOT, and I mean a LOT of complaints about the front of the house. The security staff. Etc. So, I was extra observant as to how they treated patrons, VIPs, etc. And let me just say, even beginning my experience with a somewhat tainted view of security and staff, they blew me away with their professionalism and courtesy. Yes, there are lines. Yes, do your homework ahead of time and figure out what is/isn't allowed. But don't write a bad review because they threw your gum away or wouldn't let you bring in medication. Again, this ensures a classy and safe time for ALL the people who spent an arm and a leg to have a great time. We had a daybed, so the line was much faster to get through than the general admission. We had several questions, flagged people down, and this amazing thing happened - when we were courtious, the staff was courteous right back! Special props to Channing - their staff was so respectful and amazing I even remember their names after all that alcohol and debauchery.   The venue inside is top notch. No splashing like other day clubs allowed (thank God). Serving staff was amazing, and yes food prices were steep - THIS is Vegas people! Again not a shocker.  We got to watch Kaskade do his thang, and the vibe was AmAZING. Best part of my three day weekend for sure. Ladies, bring a nice swim suit. If you have a nice body, this is the place to flaunt it and not be ashamed if it's skimpy. Guys were all really respectful and classy - don't come here to be a perve or rub up on girls. I was with a group of large tattooed men so it wasn't a problem for me.  Overall, I definitely hope Encore keeps this a classy, high end day club.

My friend and I purchased pre-sale tickets several days in advance. We arrived at the club almost an hour before midnight so we could get in for sure and scope out the place before it gets super packed. We wait in the security line and get searched, have our ids and tickets checked, and got all the stamps and everything. We are then granted entry into the club and all seems good.  My friend and I then go sit in the pool for about 10 minutes, then we decide to get a locker for our belongings. We walk over to the locker area and begin buying a locker at the payment kiosk.   During the 90 seconds it took me to complete the purchase of the locker, my friend disappeared like a ghost. I walk over to the locker to put my phone in but then realize my friend is nowhere to be found. I start calling him and eventually we talk on the phone and he says he got ejected from the club.  I walk over near the exit which is right next to the payment kiosk to look for him and we wave at each other. He is indeed outside of the club maybe 20 feet from me being denied to return to the club. I start enquiring as to what had happened and why my friend had been ejected as I was standing right next to him and there was no commotion, violence, or anything.  At this point the real fun began. I asked if I could speak to the manager as there must be some kind of misunderstanding. We got through security, had no weapons, no contraband, didn't yell at anyone or hit anyone, we just purchased a locker and somehow my friend was ejected before I had a chance to take a deep breath.  As I began to enquire more what had happened and if I could speak to the manager. The security gentlemen at Encore Beach Club began yelling at me that I had to stop asking questions and either go further into the club or they would eject me as well. At this point I was just baffled. I continued to ask them what had happened and to speak with someone higher up. They were not having it, and they began grabbing and yanking on my arms and my shoulders vigorously without my consent as they shoved me out of the club. I couldn't believe that I was being assaulted and battered by several security staff at an establishment I had paid for and had not been at for more than 30 minutes.   I know what you're thinking; they don't just kick people out for nothing. You guys must have been doing something, yelling, smashing stuff or something. Well you'd be sadly mistaken. I have never experienced the kind of disrespect and inability to resolve simple customer disputes as I did that night at Encore Beach Club. What happened to customer service? What happened to  the customer is always right ?  I'm sure some people have a good time at this club but knowing the mentality with which they operate it now, I will never be returning to here or anything under the Wynn name again.   My advice is to not ever go here. They are willing to take your money, take more of your money, then eject you without reason or explanation and CRIMINALLY ASSAULT and BATTER their peaceful, paying customers.   These people are a disgrace to the Wynn organization and the entire hospitality industry. I was criminally assaulted and battered by their personnel.

A host showed us to a perfect, free spot right along the pool facing Tiesto. Within a couple of hours the place filled up. It was the most attractive crew I've ever seen. Half of the girls looked like models, and my friend was drooling over the guys. We met a great group of people and were able to get within feet of Tiesto to dance. I went to Rehab last year and this blew it away. Far cleaner, nicer, and much more attractive people. I had a huge amount to drink and my total bill was $225.

In clubs if you don't have a table its okay because there are still many places to sit, where the beach clubs, especially has nowhere to sit! you can only sit if you have a table or cabana. Tip get a table so you can sit and lay on the sofas.. Best if your hungover and want to take a nap after a few more drinks and get a tan.   Encore is pretty spacious and the layout is nice. Takes awhile to order the drinks at bar. Ordered the strawberry margarita and it was so tasty and refreshing. Not too strong but it kicks in later :) Good crowd. Last time I went it was okay but this time around better looking crowds. If your single like me that's a great bonus! ;) It was pretty packed and the music was great!  If you come to Vegas Encore is the beach club to check out! btw nice little shower in the middle to dance around. Especially when it gets hot! You can also order food.

Both DELISH but the obvious favorite is Raspberry Lemonade. We bought them a pitcher, which was pretty pricey ($85) but a good time with new friends is priceless!  It might be a good idea to get a table/day bed/cabana because there were a lot of people who just had to leave their things by the planters, which isn't ideal in my opinion.

The main point of this beach club is to admire (or be disgusted by) the variety of body types and beach-wear ensembles. As a people-watching enthusiast myself, I would give this place top marks. Apparently part of the beach club is of the club Surrender, but does it matter when you are busy trying to find a place to sit? We hid our stuff by a tree near an empty table and hopped into the pool. They have shallow edges around and in the middle by the dancing island, so a place to sit should not be difficult to find.  Drinks are expensive. Perhaps I've been spoiled by pre-gaming but ordering a Bloody Mary for a friend and a shot of Goose for me turned out to be 28 without tip. Phew.

Here's some things you need to know, some of it is common knowledge, some not so much.   Edit: Due to questions about Item #6 I've added a bit more detail.   1: Your best bet to get in without dealing with the bad attitude security staff is to find a promoter and let them do the work for you. Look on Yelp and you'll find good ones that can make getting in a breeze.  2: When you go here, don't take anything that the security people could think is suspicious. Eye drops, Tylenol, even prescriptions will have security either tossing it or giving you a major attitude. In some cases I've seen people flat out turned away and if you protest, your exit is pretty much assured.  3: Once you're in your best deal is to get a day bed or a cabana. Otherwise it's a PITA to keep track of any personal items you bring in. And space becomes almost non-existent fast. When a big name DJ is there, you'll be thinking this is what being a sardine in a can feels like.  4: Bottle service. It just saves so much hassle. Pay up, do it, you won't regret it. 5: Don't think you can do your best Michael Phelps imitation and swim at EBC. You're eye candy and really nothing more than a 2 legged ATM to them. Float in the water, check out the people, enjoy the experience, and try not to annoy the  lifeguards  who use their whistles to spoil your fun with any chance they get.  6: SERIOUS FYI: Beware of the cuties. That cute woman you're staring at that comes up to talk to you and gets you to blow half your Vegas budget at the bar? She could be an independent contractor, one of approximately 50, yes I said FIFTY different women, hired each day / night for the express purpose of being fun eye candy to entice you to spend money at the bar and on amenities. The women doing this work can make VERY reasonable money doing so, and all you get at the end is a lighter wallet and no chance of anything else. This isn't a sour grapes thing, I know some women who work here and know how it works. I'm just a local sharing what I know so that maybe you can save some money. Don't say nobody warned ya.  7: Don't gripe about drink prices. EBC pours some STIFF DRINKS for that $17 you just dropped, and don't forget to tip.   Overall, EBC is one of Wynn's cash cows. They continue to find innovative ways to extract maximum revenue from you and if you don't want to cough up the cash there's a long line of people that do. But if you go in knowing what to expect and adjust your expectations you can have a blast here.

The table was comfy and was a good place to store your bags and shoes and you could order both food and drink. The Lilypad was a great place to be in and out of the pool at the same time .... but you can't order food or store your stuff (so luckily we had both the Lilypad and the table!). Service at both was good - but our hostess was definitely overbooked and it was hard to track her down.  The cabana service was top notch .... unfortunately, you can't be in the pool and the cabana at the same time which I think is good if your group is older and wants to stay away from the mess, but all we wanted to do was dance in the pool. For the price of a cabana, I think it should have some easy pool access (or some sort of mini pool, like Liquid Lounge) to tie the whole thing together.  Overall, it was a great pool party - our various hostesses were really sweet despite the crowd and we had an amazingly fun day.

I have attended the night swim and the day parties. The night swim is great if you don't want to dress up but want to party! They have floaties out to lay on and is a blast! The night swim is called Surrender Night Swim, but it is the same as Encore during the day, just a different entrance.  The day swim is also a blast. What I love about it is that there are three pools. Most other day parties only have one pool and it is too crowded. This club has a lot of room to stand, a lot of shady areas to stay away from the sun, and a ton of famous people play here.I would come to this beach party over Marquee any day.   Warning - the alcohol is super expensive, just like all clubs in Vegas, so I would recommend pre-gaming before you get there or you will be paying $18+ per drink unless you can get free drinks from people or get a table.", "Date": "2015-09-02", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Sid", "ReviewID": "qscl8VQVRIRtqrOr-JU7yQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Have you been to a pool party in Vegas?

I originally had a deposit in for a Lily Pad, but I had my host upgrade us for free to a daybed, front and center (You can't order food on the lily pad since it's in the water). Our view of the DJ booth was insane. The daybed was right behind the water couches, which is what I originally wanted, but they sold out weeks earlier.  The opening DJ was really good, considering he had to spin for almost 3 hours long. We ordered pitchers of some cocktail, bottles of vodka, and a bunch of food for everyone in my group. Our waitress was prompt and continuously checked in on us. Once Avicii came on the place went nuts and everyone was jumping up and down.  I can see why EBC is considered the number 1 dayclub in Vegas. It has that touch of sophistication and an amazing party atmosphere.  If you're thinking about getting a table/beach couch/cabana/daybed/lily pad, I recommend you go through a host instead of their booking website. You'll definitely get a better minimum spend on the location going through a host.

I believe it is also the largest pool on the strip. I've seen Afrojack and Deadmau5 spin at EBC and it's always been a good time. They get the best EDM DJ's in the world here(just like Marquee Day Club), so if you like pool parties and EDM this is the place to be. They have DJ's such as Tiesto, Avicii, Deadmau5, Afrojack, Steve Angello, Calvin Harris, Deniz Koyu...  Entry: I can't stress this enough: Buy presale tickets online! If you know you are going to go beforehand, just do it. It'll save you lots of $$, about 50% off what you would pay at the door. You'll save lots of time waiting in line as well. The one time we didn't buy online presale tix, we had to wait in a super long line to get in the day of and it took forever. After waiting for over an hour and not moving very much we decided to do what you always do if you don't want to wait: Grease the bouncers. So we greased him a Benjamin and we finally got to the front where we then had to pay the full price which was something like $125 each. Ridiculous! If we had bought our tix online it would have been like $60. You can bring in a backpack but you can't bring in any outside food or drink and they inspect it very thoroughly. You cannot bring in eye drops or any medication. You will need to check it in at the front and then go back to get it if you need it.   Environment: Unlike Marquee Day Club, there is plenty of space to find an area to sit either on the edge of the pool or on the side by one of the planters. The capacity of EBC is probably 3 times the size of Marquee Day Club, so it seems much more relaxed. Be warned, the music is very loud because they have speakers surrounding the entire pool which is actually quite impressive. I think I counted something like 80 speakers surrounding the pool all along the walls. Because of this there isn't really any place you can go where the music is not loud, so if you need a break from the noise you'll need to leave the pool or bring ear plugs. Since the pool is so large, you can easily find a place to take a quick dip on either side or in the middle in front of the DJ.  There is an area to dance in front of the DJ as well.   Food/Drink: Drinks are ridiculously expensive which is expected at any Vegas club, almost $20 per drink after tax and tip. However food is actually pretty good here, and costs much less than alcohol! The chicken sandwich/wrap is what I order every single time. They also sell soda, powerade, water, and beer at the food window. The line usually moves much faster than the line at the bar, so if you just want a beer or soda or water, this is a good place to go.   One complaint about this place... the security is not very good, but as expected they probably are just temporary workers, not permanent. One time I was drinking my powerade and a head of security lady came up to me and told me I wasn't allowed to bring in outside food or drink and told me to throw it away. As you can imagine I was very confused since I had paid like $5 for it at the food window! So I argue with her for a little while and she still doesn't believe me so then my friends have to come and back me up and tell her that I really bought it at the food window, along with beer, water etc. Obviously she did not know what drinks they actually sold at the food window so she finally gave up and believed us.   EBC sets the standard for how all other pool parties in Vegas should be, which is why I gave it 5 stars. People who give it four stars are just complaining about the service or price of drinks, but wtf do they expect? And where else is there a better pool party in Vegas? Marquee is the only other pool party that compares because they get all the popular DJ's too, and all the really hot model girls go there.

For a point of reference, I've been to Rehab, Marquee Day Club, and Liquid (at Aria). But I don't really need to go to all the pool parties in Vegas to know that this one is one of the best -- I come here almost every time I come to Vegas in the summer - it's been consistently good for years and I never have a bad time. I don't know if classy and Vegas pool party ever go together in the same sentence, but I think this is the classiest of the pool parties, if a thing ever existed.  The lines can get super long and crazy, especially if there is a good DJ playing. If you know are going to come here, stay at the Encore and buy tickets ahead of time so that you can skip the line. Cover will be around $40-80 depending if you're a girl or a guy and who is playing (bought via the Encore concierge) Get there early, around 11:30 am or 12 pm to avoid the craziness and crowds - sometimes if it gets too crowded, they will stop letting people in.  To me, this is way more fun than the clubs at night - no heels that you have to wear for hours, sunshine, good music, and hanging out in the pool in 100 degree weather (usually). There's no hiding what anyone looks like here, in broad daylight and bathing suits, you better hope you've been working out.  I recommend not bringing anything to check in (no phone, no purse) because the bag check is $25. It's certainly better to pay that than to stash your phone somewhere and get it stolen, but $25 bag check fee is pretty ridiculously high.   Drinks are expensive, around $10 for a beer and $16-18 for a mixed drink, but pretty normal for Vegas. They also serve food if you get hungry which is pretty awesome - they have chicken fingers, some salads, sandwiches. There's probably 10 things on the menu. Food is decent and will run you $15-20 per thing.  The party usually gets pretty busy around 1 pm and the main DJ plays around 2:30-3 pm. The party usually starts to wind down around 5 pm. There's a stage with a pole with  rain  that is in the middle of the pole. It ends up attracting either girls that look like ex-strippers who will sometimes get dollar bills in their bathing suits, girls who shouldn't be up there to begin with, girls that are too drunk, and/or girls grinding on one another. Whatever is up there is pretty entertaining and it's one of these things where the girls think they look sexy, but in reality it's more like a trainwreck where you can't look away.  All in all, it's a super fun time and one of the bigger pool parties with a better looking crowd of people that most the other pool parties and good DJs.

Beach Club I really like and will be back for Steve Aoki on Fridays- of course, I'm going to be outside the whole time.   Yeah crowd was very mellow. At least for us, we were mellow more because of the DJ. BF and I sat down to listen and nitpick. If you are music listeners like us and have DJ gear at home, you would see that there was some that was not working nor was the song selection the best in creating a  mood ....it was scattered. There was moments where we liked what we picked, but it was shortlived as something usually, the song choice or mix in that we were not feeling. If you don't get music, ignorance I guess is bliss and go ahead and dance your ass off, but we just can't. We aren't club heads so music better be good.   I know Steve Aoki well and if it's one thing that guy does well is create a coherent set and works crowds like no other so the vibe will change once he is here. I know I will be found in the forefront by the DJ booth going apeshit. He's a little dose of home and the club scene in LA I love. Oh and Kasade is the resident for Sunday afternoons.

Myself and my two buddies had a GREAT time here.  We utilized a 3rd party company called Good Times VIP for our tickets and although we were warned about doing this it ended up being the best idea of the trip.  Not only did we bypass all the lines but we paid about $100 for 3 guys to enter.  Usually for guys, tickets are going to run you about $50 per.  The individuals who bought tickets through Encore or had whatever hook up from the random promoter on the strip that still lives in his parent's basement were in that line for a LONG time.  Check in is pretty intense but I had no problems bringing in my book bag with all of our stuff in it.  Right after check in we checked our bag.  It is $25 dollars to check your bag and you can get it in and out as many times as you want.  Then with your money, cell phone, or any other valuables you put it in a plastic bag they seal in front of you.  The wrist band they give you has a series of numbers on it that matches the sealed bag.  No this will cost you $5 to check and re-check throughout the day.   This isn't a shocker but drinks are expensive.  We drink beer so buckets of beer were $144 but it was for 12 beers which last a little while.  My only complaint is the water situation.  I did not see any available for free and when you order water at the bar you get this fancy 4 oz bottle of Fiji water.   What the hell am I supposed to do with that?  I think after we took turns buying buckets with 3 waters our total each time was $177.  The place is beautiful and it is definitely on the bucket list if you are doing the whole pool party scene.  Music was great, we were there for TJR and it was busy but not as crazy like when some of the mega star DJ's spin that sh*t.  I thought everybody looked like they were having a good time and I saw all kinds of different people at this event.  I think Encore would like you to believe that only people who are models and don't eat carbohydrates are allowed in but that is far from the truth.  Trust me I saw the same people I see at the Flamingo Pool at this spot.  All different shapes, sizes and colors.

This is as good as it gets for the most part. Huge pool, lots of people, great eye candy and awesome music with some of the best DJs spinning here all summer. Be aware that it does get crowded and sometimes hard to get in (unless you know someone or are willing to pay for a cabana/table). Even then the prices for cover and bottle service can be on the higher side.  There is plenty of space to sit in the pool and even dance in the pool should you so choose. The challenge with this place is that you can't bring anything in with you (you can check your backpack or try to just bring a really small bag). The music and vibe is really good and people are friendly.

I've been to TONS of dayclubs in Vegas, and this was by far the BEST! #1!!!  Came here to see Steve Angello on Saturday. Arrived around 11am and there was a short 10 minute wait to get in. Very organized!   We had bottle service for a group of 6 people (4 guys, 2 girls) and did 4 pre-sale female tickets. The service was great! There was a bit of wait time when it got busy, but that's completely understandable. I swear, they must have changed our ice every 20-30 mins and our mixers were always topped off. I was thoroughly impressed.  What I really enjoy about this venue is the ambiance. It's large, beautiful, and you can actually enjoy the pool. I never had to wait in line at the restrooms, bar lines were decent, prices were average for any place in Vegas, and they had a grill window that served lunch food, which was also pretty good for the price.  Music was heard well throughout the venue. The dance area in front of the dj is small, but you really don't even need to be near there to get good sound. In fact, it was a bit TOO loud near the dj booth, so I'd suggest taking your drink to the pool instead.  Lastly, the waitresses and waiters are GORGEOUS! I've never seen so many great looking people working in one dayclub before. Definitely a great spot to scope out eye candy!  Our promoter Anthony Khotsikian was excellent. He came by our table to make sure everything was okay. Table service was definitely worth the money we put down.   This is now my #1 spot for day clubbing.

Our experience started out a little awkward, but ended up being a good time.  Our promoter hooked us up with a cabana and told us that they were giving ladies complimentary mimosas from 11:30am - 1pm, if I remember correctly. When we arrived, he instructed us not to get in line, rather, to wait in a weird grassy area down a set of stairs. We ended up being corralled with large groups of other girls who were apparently told the same thing by their promoters. It was hot and there was barely any shade. We were all waiting for about 45 minutes before we were finally lead into the venue.  Turns out, cabanas weren't given to individual groups, there were only 5 available and it was a free-for-all once we got in. Luckily, we hit it off with another large group of girls (who were also from northern Cali) and happily shared a cabana with them. Once we got our first round of mimosas (which were surprisingly strong), the initial aggravation gave way to a happy buzz.  My best girlfriend and I were floating after our 2nd mimosa and decided to take a stroll around the pool. We observed gorgeous people everywhere having fun in the sun. Some really nice guys struck up a conversation with us and invited our entire cabana to share their table and pool-space. They kindly offered us drinks, but those darned mimosas really finished me, so I simply enjoyed chatting with them while cooling off in the pool.  One of the staff members had mistaken me for a popular import model, lol, no harm done, really! We all left later that afternoon feeling mighty fine. The place was pretty poppin' for a Friday morning, but not uncomfortably packed.

Encore Beach Club was everything I hoped for in a beach club experience! Came here to see David Guetta who, like the primadonna he is, did not show up until 3pm and then pretended to mix his music on stage.   The bouncers and ticket collectors here were impressive. Professional, courteous and efficient despite the massive amount of people here. Lines moved very quickly everywhere. I'm really impressed with the beautiful bartenders here. The girls were constantly smiling, moved the lines quickly and efficiently, were very calm despite the massive mobs everywhere, made great drinks (not too strong which was a bit disappointing, but good) and very very professional and good looking! Every staff member I saw treated the guests equally and professionally which was so awesome to see. Encore Beach Club maintains that exclusive, sexy, hip vibe by hiring beautiful staff, but they are beautiful staff who really know how to treat their customers. Excellent! Great service!  The Beach Club is large, beautiful, clean, promotes socialization andddd there's nowhere to sit unless you want to drop a lot of money. Literally, not even a wall or bench to sit on. I understand they want to promote interaction and force people into wanting to purchase a cabana or lily bed, but the fact that I had to stand for hours upon hours in the baking sun made me leave early. There are several bars and a food station which surprisingly also moved quickly and was helpful when you're trying to get drunk but not sick.   The people here were surprisingly NOT dou****! While most of the guests here are ridiculously good looking, and probably dont include ice cream or cheese in their diets, I was pleased to see that there were actually all different types of people, various races, weights, ethnicity, and sizes here. Most people are really friendly, easy to talk to, and looking to have a fun time. There's always a few arrogant or creepy people, but that's life. The pool was a nice size and there were people dancing around it and having an awesome time laughing and swimming around. Met some really cool people here!  I loved Encore Beach club! Somethings turned me off like some trash in the pool, a couple literally having sex in the pool, someone forcibly grabbing me, the no seating, and the fact that water is ONLY available for purchase. No seriously...you cannot get a cup of water. We were told there were water stations around the pool...none! So we were forced into only drinking alcohol...bummer.

I have not been to the Wynn or Encore but once, to try and get into XS but the line was EXCESSIVE so we decided to pass. Anywho.... it was 4th of july wknd and since we did the 3 day thing for EDC (and I wasn't off on monday) we were going to lay low. However, I won a table to see Tiesto at the Joint on Saturday night and we decided to keep the mood going with a daybed to see Afrojack on the 4th. I had 5 people with me that were going to assist with the bill so we had thought this would work out.  Bottom line, I spent WAY more than I had intended, but Afrojack was amazing, the vibe was excellent and we even got to see Steve Aoki and Lil' Jon up close and personal. That's probly the best part about this pool- the DJ booth is so close, you can almost touch them and I guess if your big pimpin', or just got alot of money, you can even get a table right there next to the stage to party at.

However, it all didn't start all that well. Went there EDC weekend and had reserved a table in advance for $1300. Got to the place and was told that all the tables for $1300 had sold out ; this is after having confirmed a reservation. Some short douchy little wannabe surfer dude with a clipboard came and said, well we can still get you a table if you give me $300. Wasn't happy to hear all this and he's like while you think about it you can get out of the line. We decided to just say F it and pay the 300 but now he's telling me to get to the back of the line, and that with an attitude like he's Steve Wynn himself. I understand you have to be assertive in those situations but guests of the hotel shouldn't be treated this way, specially after having confirmed reservations and now being told to pay extra 300 even though we showed up way before time.   Long story short, it's a awesome fun place, great dj's. BEWARE of the staff as they will try to drain every single dollar you have to get you absolutely nothing. I'm sure I'm not the first or last person this has or will happen to.   Buy tickets in advance and stand in line. Way cheaper. Don't worry about bottle service unless you're willing to spend upwards of 5k. We ended up with a $2700 bill for 6 of us and our table was in a dark desolate corner. We were too faded to care then but looking back at it, it was a rip off. Pre sale is the way to go. Even with $17 drinks you won't spend anywhere close to the table. As far as the status that comes with a table, there's none unless you're in a prime location and those are upwards of 5k.", "Date": "2013-07-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Diana", "ReviewID": "Qhe2A2Z2MjunM3vUTY0lYQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Best pool scene in Vegas!!  My friend got us on the guest list so we didn't have to pay cover. The place is huge inside!! And it's not ridiculouslyyy crowded like Tao Beach. You still have a lot of room to sit, stand, walk, dance, breathe. Music was really good too but not so loud that you feel the beat pumping through your entire chest. I guess that could be a pro or con depending on your preference.   I also had one of the best drinks of my life here! Do yourself a favor and go to the bar and get a WATERMELON 21! It's on the cocktail menu. It's a little pricey at $15 but we all loved it!! It's so refreshing, you can barely taste the alcohol, and it comes with a salted rim even though it's not quite a margarita. Yummmm! I want another one right now!   The only downside about this place is there's not many beds which are all reserved, so if you want to tan and lay out, you just have to find a spot near the pool and lay on your towel.   Overall, it's a really fun pool scene, perfect for young people to come and have a good time whether you wanna go crazy or just chill at the pool.

We were enjoying our time by the pool, when we noticed the crowd began to have some fun by splashing some water. We met some nice people by the pool, one of them started to play with her man by splashing a little water on him and accidentally splashed some water on one of the lifeguards. the amount of water was minimum, close to nothing, but the lifeguard was not pleased by it. She rudely asked them to get out of the water. (DO REMEMBER we are at a pool, and the lifeguard should always expect to get wet. also, it's a pool. Am i suppose to just stand there and NOT touch the water?) The lifeguard instantly got down from her post, and started to approach the woman aggressively asking her to step out of the water. The woman who was told to get out of the water agreed to leave with her friends, and as they were walking out we noticed the lifeguard lady rushing her! RUSHING HER! This lifeguard (I believe her name was Liliana Silva) ran towards her as if she was going to hit her! The woman was leaving with her party, she was cooperating with security so I was amazed that the Encore would allow their staff to act so rudely. The woman did throw a shoe in her at defense, which a lot of us agreed we would've done the exact same thing under those circumstances. If she would have not defended herself, the lifeguard would've really hurt this girl. She looked so young too!! This made me feel really unsafe about the security of Encore. They were so rude to the woman and her friends when they were clearly not doing anything bad! They did not defend their guest as much as they backed up their staff. We all clearly saw the lifeguard girl acting extremely rude and unprofessional, and they tried to hide it by putting the attention on the actual guest! MIND YOU, THE WOMAN WAS NOT DRUNK AT ALL! As I mentioned earlier, I had made friends with her and her party and took it upon me to make sure they were okay.... well that wasn't possible since the Encore actually kicked them out of the hotel in general!! I would not recommend coming here. It is a very popular hotel, but the security sucks and so does the staff! The lifeguard was extremely aggressive and seemed violent. The rest of my visit here I spent it being paranoid that the smallest complaint was going to be taken the wrong way.

If not, DO NOT GO HERE!  I'm somewhat indifferent with this place. Only reason I went because a good DJ was playing. (Thats all) First off, GET there early or you will have nowhere to sit whatsoever. Literally, you have to pay to sit almost anywhere here. You cannot even bring in your own sunscreen. If you want sunscreen, you have to pay $30 for it from them. They are very picky on what they let you bring in when they  screen  you at the front. They even confiscated my buddies vapor so he couldn't vape. (Not allowed I guess, but cigarettes are ok) It's almost worse than dealing with the TSA agents at an airport. A bacardi and coke cost $22 and a water cost $11. The place is big and the pools are huge, (towels are FREE) but once again, Don't expect to find anywhere to sit unless you buy a table or lounge day beds for major $$$.  The pools are really dirty as I opted out not going in them. Cigarette butts, empty beer cups and just trash floating around. The bathrooms are even WORSE! (and thats being nice) I had to walk over puke just to use the bathroom.  This place is really nothing spectacular to be honest. Overhyped and not all that. I personally think Marquee pool is much nicer (cleaner for sure) and drinks are much cheaper ($14 for Bacardi & Coke compared to $22 here) Nicer staff too. Overall it was fun hanging out with my friends, but our attitudes were a mere  MEEEHHH!  afterwards, nothing impressive about this place.  ***UPDATE 6/20/15*** - I was just in Vegas this past weekend for my buddies 30th birthday. He really wanted to go to this place. Being his birthday and he wanted to go here, We went to Encore beach Club at night (Thursday) I wasn't gonna complain as it's a lot less crowded than Friday's and Saturdays. Well guess what? I got Tinea Versicolor (skin fungus) most likely from the dirty rafts in the pool literally the day after we went to this place. Against my instinct I KNEW I shouldn't of gotten in the pool.

I went in with low expectations because I thought it would be extremely hot (in the upper 90s and 100s) and overcrowded, but I surprisingly had a great time! Definitely want to come back again :D   The whole area was pretty big; there was plenty of room to go around in the water and also a decent amount of free seating for those who did not pay $$$ to reserve something.   I can't comment on prices since my friends and I (all girls) were on the guest list and didn't get any drinks past the two complimentary champagne drink tickets we got as part of the guest list, but here are some tips:  -They have a very strict security policy. They very thoroughly checked our bags and even threw out a small pack of gum from my friend's bag. I was really surprised they were so strict. I have a picture in my review of their sign that lists out what isn't allowed, but here are some of the things I remember: real cameras, outside food/drinks, over-the-counter medication, gum, eye drops, and selfie sticks.  -They give you towels for free. You can go back and grab more.  -Bag check is $55 per bag and lockers were $75 on the day I went, so if you want to spend most of your time in the water, I would recommend either bringing a water proof pouch to stick your valuables (phone, ID, money, etc.) and leave the rest of your stuff at the various seating around the pool. We circumvented this by taking turns having someone sit with our stuff at one of the cushioned seating areas in the shade. Some people also left their belongings by the side of the pool wrapped in a towel.  -Speaking of seating, it was all cushioned and super comfy! I really appreciated the comfy seating as part of my group ended up sitting for most of Zedd's set. Some of the seats are in the sun, but there are definitely some shaded spots as well. Especially once Zedd came on, most people went into the dancing area or the water and the seated areas were pretty empty, so my friends and I were able to easily snag one of these spots. It was still pretty hot in the shade, but nowhere as hot as it would've been under the sun.  -Zedd came on at 3:30 and played until 5:30 or so. We didn't realize this, so we came kind of early around 1 pm.  -The dance area right in front of the DJ stand is right in the sun and doesn't get any shade. Bring sunscreen if you're planning to spend most of your time in the pool or dancing.  -One of my friends mentioned there was no free water. Instead they charge you $10 for Fiji water.

You could really tell how much the crowd's energy changed as soon as he came on.   Apparently we came on the most crowded day of EBC they've had this year so far (6/6/15) but we still had ample dancing space in the water & in the shade near the bars, so that was really great.   Walking through crowds took a little bit of time, but just be patient and don't be that rude individual that pushes and yells at others. It wasn't that bad.   Lines for the restroom can be a little long once mid-day hits, but you'll get through it. I do wish there were more bathrooms though.   Vibes are generally chill (with the exception of one guy who accused us of stealing one of his water bottles when we had just gotten back from a 20 minute trip to the bar--he eventually apologized after pulling a security guard over).  Drinks are expensive. $20+ each for a gin & tonic. But they were appropriately measured & poured. Tickets are pricey, but I gladly would've payed again to avoid standing in that ridiculous line in the hot sun waiting who knows how long to get inside.  Some quick tips:  - Park in the Wynn self-parking structure and walk across the pedestrian bridge on the 2nd floor to save yourself from walking through the Encore casino - If you have a ticket, walk across the lines (security will usually direct you) through the doors into the building; you don't have to line up outside in the heat (thank goodness) - Line will move fairly quickly. From around the corner to the entrance of EBC, it took maybe 30 minutes - The less you have, the quicker the bag check will be. If you have a wallet on you, be ready to open it up. - Towels can be picked up next to the restroom by the entrance - Bar next to the stage is less crowded than the bar on the side and the line usually isn't as long - There's another restroom next to the bar on the side - Find a nice corner in one of the planters to stash and pile up your group's stuff.

You will say I am so glad I'm not sitting in the pool all day. Now on with the review...... I fist pumped like a champ for almost 8 hours....  I DON'T EVEN FIST PUMP... And none of my friends do. We were all doing it. Being originally from NJ I was disapoint. This guy could really DJ. And he made it so when you stopped moving you felt like an asshole. And Everyone else around will be dancing... It's just fantastic.. Just fantastic.. If you like to have fun at all just try it... I can't really explain it..... OH bring friends cause this place is huge and overwhelming.   P.S. GET THE CHAIR for 150..... it goes towards your drinks, so if you spend it anyway free chair.. if you get enough friends you can get a giant bed or something like that.", "Date": "2010-07-08", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Alison", "ReviewID": "JjucuppyvOwRUhjDCKVQQA", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Apparently beach clubs are the hot thing now. Seems like all the upscale places have a pool party/ day clubbing thing. Anyways courtesy of another hookup we got in for a discounted price. Otherwise I think it's $20 for girls and like $30/$50 for guys depending on the day. Anyways walked in and groups of mostly young ladies and groups of older guys (in their 40s and 50s). Weird. And it's not so much a club as a pool where people drink and smoke and talk. Otherwise you're just sitting there trying to get a tan. Music was good but hardly anyone was dancing. Not sure I would call it a day club. Also it's a pretty small area - mostly pool and the exclusive cabanas everywhere. No place to just sit though like no lounge chairs. Everyone who didn't have a cabana was in the pool or on the edge of the pool or sitting on the concrete planters around the vegetation. Pretty views from the property and it's décor is nice. Noticed the exclusive infinity hot tubs - those are cool but again looked only available to those with tables. At least two huge bars on either side of the pool and they actually had open bar for an hour. I don't think anyone knew about it but our promoter friend told us. Only girls could get free drinks and the free drinks were either mimosas or mixed drinks with skinny girl (diet?) vodka (like vodka cran). Free is free - can't complain.

I feel so bad for guys!  Once again, major perks to be a girl!! FREEEEEE for us!! We bypassed the line with ease and got into the club within minutes.  This place is beautiful and glamorous.

If you aren't splurging on these bad boys, have no fear!  You can sit along the side of the pool! Drinks here are around $15 and up.  For some reason, Wet Republic's drinks were more worth it. (alcohol content-wise). I had several of their drinks, and some of them tasted like no alcohol was mixed in.  The Strawberry margarita,  margarita on the rocks, and watermelon drinks, which were tasty and refreshing.  The vibe here is definitely different from Wet Republic.  It is more chill but at the same time a good relaxing time.  All you keep doing is looking at all these hot bodies passing by you.  It's ridiculous! One girl sprained her ankle and had it wrapped but still pushed herself to wear heels!! The things people do to look hot for one day!  The grill, for quick food, is available at the end of the club.  Spacious bars were available.  The service is quick and enjoyable.    All I gotta say is Kaskade was AMAZING!  My first time seeing him live and for free!!  He is so passionate into his music.

We had our empty Fat Tuesday bottles thrown out sadly. :(  We got a towel upon entrance then my friends and I put our stuff in the lockers that are offered for $10 each. The workers were good at judging what would fit in the lockers (since they put our stuff away for us) and we ended up fitting in about 2 medium sized bags each. (There's an option to try to fit whatever you can in a small black bag too.)  The place got crowded throughout the day, but I still felt pretty comfortable being there.

Also, the system I use at work is down, so... you know.   All the previous times I attempted a Vegas day-rage experience had been a complete and utter fail-- TAO Beach was overly crowded, extremely douchetastic, and had absolutely TERRIBLE customer service; the pool at Wet Republic smelled strongly of semen, sweat and human desperation; other times, our group, valiantly fighting to uphold the stereotype that Asians are late to everything, did not get to the dayclub in time to claim our free daybed and decided to reaffirm the other stereotype that Asians are terribly cheap and went to the pool instead.  (What... There wasn't anywhere to sit...)  We had to deal with a lot of the same Vegas BS when we went to EBC.  We were told the guest list closed at 2 but it ended up closing at 1 because they hit capacity and we would have to pay cover to get in. WHAT!!! WE'RE LADIES. WE HAVE LADY PARTS. WE DON'T NEED TO COUGH UP OUR DOUGH TO HAVE OUR LADYPARTS IN YOUR CLUB. Alas, we did, and that good ol' Asian stinginess was about to kick in again when our friend reminded us that we had dragged ourselves out of bed specifically to come here, that we'd been wanting to check out EDB forever and to stop being such cheap-o beezies.  Point taken. So we waited in the sweltering Vegas heat, steadily sweating out our morning buzz, as the line inched slowly forward, frantically texting our promoter the entire time.  We finally did make it in and had to wait in even more lines to get drinks, but after that, the par-tay definitely gets going!  ENCORE BEACH CLUB IS LEGIT!  It's hit-or-miss at night as Surrender but EBC is as fun as a barrel o' monkeys.. or a barrel o' vodka... Despite the downsides (long lines, expensive drinks and no re-entry), the pool is big enough that you have plenty of room for drunken frolicking without  some random sweaty gorilla trying to subtly rub his peen against you in the guise of dancing; the venue in general is beautiful and expansive with multiple bathrooms and bars; the music and sound system is fantastic (although this can depend, Morgan Page was spinning while we were there, although he didn't come on til 3 or 4 which was kind of a bummer); and the crowd is just there to have a good time! This was definitely one of the highlights of our trips and just overall, A FUN, RAGETASTIC EXPERIENCE--one which, in fact, made the birthday girl vomit spectacularly in the lobby of the Elara immediately after the cab ride.

Period  I'll start off by saying that I had a few connections so my review is a little scewed, but I think its still accurate. My boy Jay Shaun  at the door hooked us up with a day bed for half the minimum tab we were suppose to run, Sweet. I just took care of him. The day bed can comfortably fit anywhere from 4-6 people. We were suppose to get a day bed and a Lily pad but I tried to show up fashionably late so Some high roller paid 10k for my 1k Lilypad, silly rabbit. Anyway if your going to reserve a spot, and want to be close to the action get a Lilly pad, Its like having a bed right in the water.   Pros: Great scene, great music, clean pool, lay out of the pool was top notch, people were classy and seemed a little more upscale, think Marriot Vs. The 4 Seasons Hotel, when compared to other pool parties.   Cons: Drink were pricey, and very weak. We ordered Mojito Pitchers all day (85 a pop) and it tasted like they put about 3-4 shots in the whole thing.   Overall I love it, its a good time for girls and guys alike, enough candy to go around.

I have to receive a update but when I do or if I do I will update my review.

I went to the opening this year with Michael Phelps as the guest.  It was okay but I am assuming since it is still early for pool season the beautiful people have not yet to swarm to Encore Beach Club yet.  It was the first day of work for most of the servers so service was a little meh.    That being said...  the decor is just so beautiful.  I love the layout.  Very classy and you don't have to worry about getting pregnant if you go in the pool. Unlike Wet Republic or moreso Rehab.    Last summer we had a day bed, last week we had a lily pad.  I like the lily pad but only sucky thing is you can't eat on your lily....

Admittedly, I am not the coolest person on earth, especially when it comes to knowing the right people in the club/party scene and/or regarding what's hot or not in Vegas. You would have to ask my friends for that kind of covert info.  But thanks to those friends and their special connections, we were living it up at the Encore Beach Club with 2 bed booths and a pool cabana so needless to say, we had a blast!   The Encore Beach Club and the XS Nightclub are both at the Encore Hotel & Casino - one is the day party and the other is the night party. I'll be reviewing the latter next. The overall hotel is quite impressive and luxurious; and everywhere you look, it's eye candy galore. That's to be expected in Vegas but in some places, the ratio of  easy on the eyes  viewing is much greater than others.   For example, Encore Hotel versus Circus Circus. Ha ha wait, is that place still around? Actually, a more fitting comparison would be the Wet Republic versus the Encore Beach Club. The Wet Republic had gorgeous people everywhere but as one of the most sober people there this past Sunday, I'd have to say that the Encore Beach Club on Monday had 3-4 times the amount of amazing sights to behold than Wet Republic.   Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and I am just calling it as I saw it. Plus, my opinion is based solely upon the female population at both day/pool parties. As much as I enjoy watching the Jersey Shore, gorillas, steroid enthusiasts, and full-body tats don't do anything for me; and neither do guys who have more alcohol and/or drugs flowing through their veins than actual red blood cells. To each his own, right Babe?  Sorry for being harsh (especially since I was in Vegas) and my intention is not to be mean but like I said earlier, I was one of the most sober people there AND guess what? I still had a spectacular time!!! All I need is music and a little bit of foot room, and I am happy as can be!   The Encore Beach Club was awesome! Since we had 3 reserved areas, our group of 24 people didn't have to wait in the gnarly, long line. In fact, we were pulled-off to some side, artificial grassy area where we were carded and stamped. Next, they led us into our reserved area and started bringing-out the non-stop bottle service.   Again, as I mentioned earlier, I am truly NOT this cool but we were celebrating my sister's birthday during Memorial Day Weekend and in Vegas, you either Go BIG or Go Home!   The guest deejay was DeadMau5 and he definitely lived-up to his hype. His music was fantabulous and I think I danced at least 90% of the time; which when looking back, explains why my feet were so sore when we left. We arrived around 10:30-11am and left just after 7pm. I had a lot of fun at Wet Republic the day before but the Encore Beach Club was hands-down the BEST day/pool party ever!  My reviews have become quite the mini-editorials so on that note, I think it's funny that those of us who were neither shirtless nor thonged, stood-out in this crowd of swarming au naturel (or not) bodies and barely-there bikinis. And yes, there were plenty of guys sporting  barely-there  bikini bottoms who thought they could get away with them.  No complaints here but my eyes were so overstimulated that at some point, I became numb to the sea of nakedness. In fact, I think only a handful of people stood-out to me that day and it was because I couldn't see their derrieres, washboard abs, or glorious bosoms.

We arrived at about one, reserved the bungalow in the back and start partying like no other.  We probably had about 25-30 heads.

We're a little far from the djs so we hear it thru two small speakers, which at times wasn't loud enough :))  esp when our group became bigger and rowdier.  They end a 6pm.  Trust me, by that time you really need a restful nap to start up again in the evening. And/or maybe not, a long day of partying knocks you out til the crack of dawn the next morning.

One of the best day pool parties in Vegas. It's a must go when you go during poolparty season in Vegas.   Encore Beach is located in Encore LOL obviously, but also used as Surrender at night. There are multiple pools in the area and a mini casino by the bar and the infamous DJs that play there are usually in front of the pool that is in front of the bar section.   Pros:  -Pool is usually refreshingly cool and not freezing  -bottle service/day beds/ cabanas are plentiful and seated in great places  -bartenders are gorgeous!  -lifeguards are pretty amazing too haha  -chill people to meet  -music is pumping and amazing everywhere  -drinks are strong .....and -THEY SERVE HENNESSY OMG EXTRA STAR FOR THAT I swear no where else in Vegas has it, I almost cried from happiness  Cons  -the wait in line to get in can be almost two hours long  -cover charge is ridic, but get on guestlist and get there early , big apologies to the male race lol -Uhhh literally everywhere is wet, no dry place to put your stuff unless you wanna pay for a locker . Meaning squishy towels ... Forget drying off, your towels will be wetter than you by the time you're done!  - packed as fuuuuck to the point where I feel like I'm about to fall off walking the pathway to the bar , but whatever more people to meet, right??

Your girls will thank you when they only have to walk 2 minutes in their heels to the entrance instead of 8 minutes. Or better yet, don't drive so you can get drunk off $20 drinks in the oven they call Las Vegas.  EBC seems to have become the unofficial club for the Asians of Los Angeles. Beach clubs seem to attract a significantly younger crowd than regular clubs as well.  There is plenty of space for those without a cabana or lily pad. The lily pads are cheaper than cabanas, but end up being more fun. Get a cabana if you want your own space and don't want people coming by. The lily pads are in the water and allow you to be more social.  There are lockers to put your stuff in, but they are extremely pricey. Do yourself a favor and get a waterproof phone bag for your ID and money and don't bring anything else in. I've seen way too many people lose a phone after dropping it in at EBC and it'll save you the locker money :(  There are tables for gambling and two bars for drinks. Drinks are what you would expect at a Vegas club. The day clubs are what you think of when you hear EBC, but don't forget about their night swims. It's less hot, just as many people and just as famous of a DJ.

There's nothing better than to come to a spacious pool, good looking people, and best of all: you don't even have to try to look good.  Just grab a drink and relax in the pool, pot belly goes under water folks ;), and waddle in the water to good music.   If you come with a bad ratio of guys and girls (bad, meaning that having men in your group diminish your chances of getting in for free), I would recommend contacting a promoter about your ratio and then come very early, before noon, to avoid the $50-$60 cover charge for men. But generally, girls get in for $30 if you can't get in for the promotion price.  Oh, and if you're worried about fitting your lunch plans prior to pool time, they have a grill there that serves food.  Drinks are fairly expensive, as they regularly are in Las Vegas clubs.  The only thing to complain: I know the pools are heated, but the water is slightly too warm for the amount of people, which makes me think that the water is warm for other reasons :(  But I definitely would do this again on my next trip(s),  Summa Summa time! - Will Smith http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtDseXwpJ0U", "Date": "2012-05-21", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Lucy", "ReviewID": "SdnJqZU76Xo_JhBBtY79VA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Encore Beach Club is my first day club experience in Vegas and it was a blast! Before heading to the club, I thought I would be feeling rather self conscious of my body since I never attended a  club  in bikini wear before, but you instantly loose that feeling when you are there. The combination of the Vegas heat and seeing people in all shapes and sizes makes you stop caring. The dress code is obviously swimwear ( one piece, two piece, etc) for girls and you are allowed to wear cute coverups and shorts with your bikini.   Don't forget your sunscreen even though the girls bathroom comes stocked with sunscreen/lotions/perfumes for use if you tip! I never seen any bathroom likes the ones in Vegas clubs before. They are like mini makeup counters where you can freshen up with the products they have laid out on the counter for a price. I wonder if the men's bathroom is the same way?   Also, buy yourself a waterproof cell phone cover from Amazon if you want to bring your phone to the pool to take pictures. Those things are quite useful and they can even serve as your wallet to keep you credit cards/ID/cash. Ladies/Dudes, don't brings purses/wallets to the day club unless you have your own private cabana.Even though my friends and I have a couch and small basket tables for ourselves at the day club, it still didn't feel safe to leave our items out in the opening when we wanted to dance in the pool. We ended up stashing them under our basket tables and hoping they won't be jacked.   Ladies, make sure you contact a promotor and see if you can get a free couch/day bed/drinks when you head to Encore. Freebies are always fun and no body wants to pay thousands for a table anyways.   The music at Encore Beach Club is mainly EDM and it was great. My friends and I were a bit disappointed when we heard that Avicii canceled his event for the Saturday that we were going, but we still had fun jamming/dancing in the pool to the substitute Marshmello. Overall, Encore Beach Club is fun and you should definitely come experience Encore Beach Club if you never did before.", "Date": "2016-05-23", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
