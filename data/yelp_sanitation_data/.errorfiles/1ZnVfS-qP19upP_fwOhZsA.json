Portions are BiG Wong are indeed BIG, but unfortunately points deducted for taste and service. Located in Chinatown, this place is mixed into a shopping plaza with Monta Ramen and Kung Fu Tea.   Service: thought it could have been better. Although the lady provided the basic service- I thought it was a bit aggressive and non welcoming. We asked for extra sauce and even though we got it without any complaints- she seemed annoyed. Just a basic smile and or a  no problem  would have been nice.   Food: Again, very basic. It's good but nothing worth raving about. These are dishes that I can do and I think my haianese chicken tastes better. No offense. Theirs was very bland and you do need some sauce to make it tasty! The curry chicken with roti was a bit on the salty side but the rotis were very nice! Freshly made.   Price: very descent and the portion was huge for the price point.

We arrived about 3:30pm, the place was packed but the wait wasn't very long, only 10 mins for a party of 5.  Seems like they turn the tables over pretty quickly for a little place.  They only have 14 items on the menu so we had already decided what we were going to order before we sat down.  I got the Hoi Nam Chicken over seasoned rice, my friends got deep fried pork chop over rice, fried pork chop with udon noodle soup and curry chicken over rice.  My Hoi Nam chicken was moist, the dipping sauce was delish but the seasoned rice was the best!  We all tried each others dishes- the curry chicken had great flavor, it was more Japanese style (which I like) but was a tad greasy.  The fried pork chops were also good, but better when you dip in this sauce they give that has a beef stock taste to it.  We also ordered some vegetables in oyster sauce that was okay, nothing special since it was just steamed/boiled Chinese broccoli with sauce.  Overall, it was a success cause our meal came out to $7.95 for 5 entrees and 4 drinks with the special.

Always try not to be bias on one visit but been to this place 3 times and it was all awful. Poor service and mediocre food, I can make better food at home. Wouldn't have given this place a try but thought hey they got pretty good reviews. Sorry yelpers, not sure why it was great? 1st visit there with a party of 6 during dinner hour and was greeted by a grumpy middle age woman, she was busy calculating tickets and told us  you have to wait  when I told her we have a party of 6, her awful tone of voice made me feel like I was scolded by mom! Not the way you would greet your guest! Took her forever to service us after we got a table and they were not super busy. Just gave me the feeling she didn't like working there. The food was very simple, basic and bland! That's why I think I can make better tasting food at home. Maybe because the price was cheap thats why people are okay with it? Another time was just our family of 4 during a late lunch hour around 3:00 service was slow because there's only one guy running the show for maybe 3 tables there. Felt bad for him having to do tables and cook the food but he wasn't too friendly either. Well came here 3 times and my husband said  shame on us for not learning the 1st 2 time ! Don't waste your $5! That's how bad.  A side note, if I was the owner I would at least provide a bit of friendly service to my customers.

Their food is  good, but affordable ($5 dishes) & fresh. They are consistent: the quality of their food has remained the same since we discovered them over a year ago.  Hubby & I always order the same thing: seasoned rice & fried shrimp wontons, which are both phenomenal. They know exactly how to make the FSW's (ancient Chinese secret?), & seem to have the recipe down to a science. While I don't know the recipe for it, I believe they roll out the fresh wonton wrapper to a precise thinness, & then fry it in fresh oil at a specific temperature, for X number of minutes. This method results in a crispy (yet not exceedingly greasy) wonton wrapper. If you've eaten a lot of mediocre & MSG-laden Chinese food, you'll notice the difference.  The place itself is small & simple, so unassuming that it's the perfect facade for a magical kitchen where the chopsticks & wonton wrappers (probably) come to life to sing & dance at night. Srsly though, we saw Nicolas Cage by Big Wong once, & that's made Big Wong even more memorable for us. We've eaten at Big Wong so many times that we've kind of become friends with the main server, a Thai guy named Paul.  What does baffle us about BW is how it never seems to be as packed as we figure it ought to be. In a way, we like that, but we honestly believe that anyone that hasn't tried their food is missing out.", "Date": "2017-01-18", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Edward", "ReviewID": "5xShLhwvWSfc4SLPw706Tw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "We were trying to go to the ramen noodle place in the same shopping center but the line was ridiculous.

The curry was OK, but the roti pancakes, if you don't mind a bit of oil, were spectacular. I'd order the pancakes alone if I could (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA?select=Mrul8D6-5mwJ-26rna6d5w). **Recommendations**        - I'd recommend this place for a cheap meal.

If you are looking for a Chinese restaurant that won't break bank, Big Wong is an ideal location for you because they offer an assortment of dishes for under $6.   I ordered a special shrimp soup wonton with udon or ramen, I asked the guy if they had egg noodle, they did, so I went with that. I might have misread the title on the menu, because I was expecting regular wonton noodle soup with shrimp, which is what my other two friends had gotten, but what I got was actually shrimp soup. The broth was a rich red color and tasted exactly like shrimp. I probably wouldn't order that again because it was just too much for me to enjoy the soup, my mistake...but other than that, the noodles were great, wish they gave more wontons, but also I feel like the wonton were a tad overcooked, and the shrimp seemed mushy, but it actually wasn't.  They had bok coy cooked 2 ways I believe, decided to go with garlic, and I thought that was their best thing there, also under $6, most Chinese places would probably charge like $9+ for that, unless you get it during like a special lunch item. But ya, the bok choy was flavored well, didn't taste or look old, it had that nice bright green color, good crips, I would definitely order that again.

Here's the deal...the prices are amazing, the food is consistent and delicious, the portions are well beyond their prices, the service could be improved (from a new guest's standpoint) and no, they don't serve their drinks in fancy glasses or give you nice silverware. I'm a big fan of good food and a bigger fan of good food at a great price (this is not to say I don't enjoy my fancy meals, too). I don't care that I'm not drinking out of crystal...and for those of you that complain about the plastic forks...maybe you should learn to use chopsticks. :P  Yes, when my friend and I first started going, we were hesitant to think much of the place because it seems to be a crazy environment. However, after going time and time again, it's just how they work. They work morning through night with little help and still manage to keep the doors open. How many of you could do that day in and day out?? After building a rapport, I see the kind and humorous side in Connie (the lady that we all know) and Paul (the guy with the  fluffy chef's hat  ). Even the guy who gets louder (whose name I don't know) can have a softer side when he's not going crazy with orders.  No, we don't always have our water refilled, yes, the orders sometimes do take long to even be taken, and we used to comment among ourselves, but this place has become a staple for us to dine in during our lunch break. We gave it time, not just one...or even three times...but more because the food/prices kept us coming back. But each time you go, you understand the dynamic more and learn to appreciate, or even find the humor in it.  Many of the negative reviews are regarding their service standards and that some of their dishes being bland. One of the main dishes that I noticed people commenting on is the Hoi Nam chicken, better known as Singaporean Hainanese chicken. The chicken is meant to be prepared that way (bland) with sauces to accompany. And that sauce that goes along with...delicious! Do I like the dish? Let's just say that I don't hate it, but it's not something I would typically order for the very same reason that many of you have commented. But this does NOT mean that all foods are created equal.  But, I do recommend some of the following dishes as they are also our go-to's:  Salt and pepper chicken wings - they're crispy, salty and the addition of the jalapenos (usually) pack a good amount of punch!  Salt and pepper pork chop - same as the chicken wings in flavor - 99% of the time, it's been the most moist pork I've ever had  Thin rib eye - yes, it's fatty but some people like that; yes, it's served with potatoes and it seems odd; no, it doesn't seem like Asian food - how many of you like Asian food but have partners or friends that don't? Well, then maybe that will answer your question as to why this is on their menu...  Curry Chicken - you need to realize that this isn't your typical Thai or Indian curry chicken, it's Malaysian, and yes, it tastes different than what you're used to, and that's amazing - stop comparing apples to oranges  Chicken with mushroom and Chinese sausage - this dish takes a long time to prepare, so be warned, but it's worth it; the chicken is tender, the broth is rich, and Chinese sausage as well as some veggies are just served on the side. The veggies have no seasoning, but it's meant to be dipped into the broth. (In fact, I left during this review to eat there and had it.)  Steamed fish filet - we got this only because we saw it on the new picture menu on the wall and again, without the sauce, it would be bland, BUT it's tender and delicious with the ginger soy sauce. I've ordered it twice, now.  So, for those of you that gave negative reviews...I suggest you give it another shot and get something you know will be good. For those of you that haven't tried, go with the S&P wings and/or pork chop and Steamed chicken and mushroom w/Chinese sausage.

My  love / hate  relationship with Chinatown continues as I explore all of its places to dine and enjoy all things spicy and unbland. The love part is the incredible food and drink, which is often so very affordable, and hate is the sometimes incredibly horrible service from the wait staff. I often chalk the latter up to  cultural differences , which I often have to remind myself isn't personal, and push through, because more often than not, the food is simply worth it!. But last night was different...  Our usual spot was dark for some reason, and the backup location was jam packed, so a quick check on Yelp revealed Big Wong Restaurant. The reviews were solid, and the food appeared somewhat authentic and non-standard, as some menus tend to be. Big Wong shares a parking lot with a few culinary heavy hitters, and despite the lot being full and crowds waiting outside of a few other restaurants, we entered the restaurant and found several open tables and no wait.  Let me fast forward to the food. The prices at Big Wong are very low, and despite this, the food is good. We ordered deep fried shrimp wontons, pork chop and chicken, and enjoyed the food. The menu is not your standard Chinese food, so don't bother looking for sweet & sour pork or chow mein.   From the moment we stepped foot inside the restaurant, the service was terrible. The woman who was behind the cash register was not only the hostess, she was also the waitress and food server. And she was completely overwhelmed, to point of being overtly rude to the customers, especially me and the family! Like I said, I try not to take it personally, but after being sat down with such haste, there wasn't even a drink order taken. We sat at the table for about 10 minutes while she scurried around and struggled to figure out how to triage the food service. Keep in mind, the restaurant was not full and half the tables were well underway with eating dinner. Just as we stood to walk out (there was minimal eye contact the whole time, as though if she didn't look at the problem, maybe it would just go away!) she came over and took the food and drink order.   Once the order was placed, the food and drinks actually arrived fairly quickly. But there was no follow up during dinner, and I, along with all the other customers had to walk over and grab condiments and napkins from the counter. The best part was when a family of about six walked in. The waitress escorted the family to the table and then turned so quickly to get away from them, she actually crashed into the dad who was still directly behind her, causing quite a ruckus! Another couple entered the restaurant, were seated, and after being ignored for 10 minutes, finally got up and walked out.  Not sure if I'll try this place again with so much to choose from in China Town. If you decide to go, hopefully you'll have better service.", "Date": "2015-01-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Sergio", "ReviewID": "KrJyX9dDo2Cx3VEiSVbWZg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "The dishes in this restaurant are cheap and the portions big.

The wifey, sister-in-law, and I came here during our last Vegas trip. We wanted to get away from the strip and eat some good and cheap food. This place really hit the spot. We ordered the Chicken Wings, House Seafood Noodle Soup, Curry w/ Roku, and Han-Nan Chicken. All I can say is damn. The Chicken Wings were freshly fried, hot and crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. Well seasoned and packed with a lot of flavor. The house seafood soup was a very generous portion - loaded with fish, crab meat, tempura/oden/fish balls. Great chewy consistency on the noodles and served in a light seafood broth. The curry was tasty, loaded with spices, but I think the large chunks of potatoes took away from the meal. The Roku pancakes it was served with was a delicious dipping tool. Lastly, and probably my favorite, was the Han-Nan Chicken. Tender cuts of steamed chicken served with two dipping sauce and accompanied by the most tasty chicken broth rice I've ever had. The best part of this place is our total for 3 entrees and a side came out to be 18 dollars total. I will be back!  A little about my credentials: I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes.

My friends went here and told me that the food was legit and the prices were amazing.  After finally giving it a taste, I came back 3 days in a row.    Getting full off of a $5 meal?!?  ADDICTED!  Here are the dishes I tried:  1.  Thin rib eye over rice $4.95 - Thinly sliced rib eye is served with yummy dipping sauce.  The rice comes on a separate plate and comes with some steamed potato slices.  A great deal for rib eye!  2.  Steamed chicken, mushrooms, chinese sausage, and vegetables $5.95 - There are a lot of components to this dish that kept me from getting bored.  The chicken is served in a bowl of broth separately from the sausage, rice, and veggies.  Pour it over your rice to get some soupy chicken rice.  Gotta love the lop chong (spelling?) - 5th generation Chinese, I apologize.  3.  Hoi nam chicken (dark meat, boneless) $4.95 - Excellent!  Soft steamed chicken without any bones.  Comes with the yummy flavored rice and 2 dipping sauces.  A soy based sauce and a red spicy one.    4.  Salt and pepper chicken wings $4.95 - I love the saltiness of this one.  Tiny jalepenos are sprinkled on top as well.  Great appetizer to share with the group.  5.  Salt and pepper pork $4.95 - Thin slices of pork deep fried and then sliced.  Very similar to the salt and pepper wings but a little less salty.  I prefer the chicken wings.  6.  Beef ramen $5.95 - Ok.  Cantonese style beef ramen with all the tendon and chunks that you can ask for.  Not my thang personally.  7.  Mango pudding $1.25 - So good!  A great way to end your super cheap meal, with a super cheap dessert!  Chunks of mango are actually in the cup too :D  8.  Sweet roti $1.25? - A thin roti or bread thingy with condensed milk, powdered sugar, and other sweet goodness on top.  Gotta try it at least once.  Other random tid-bits: They always give you extra scallions in a metal tin. Easy parking. Cheap everything.  Tax is included in the price on the menu! Mom and pop store.

Everything is under $12 and the portions that are given are generous. The only thing price wise that I believe didn't make sense was the fact that my fried fish dish didn't come with rice so they charged me an extra dollar for a side of rice. Most Asian restaurants have the protein come alongside with the rice. But it was still fine. I just found it odd. My husband ordered the beef tendon noodle soup. He said it lacked flavor but he asked for soy sauce and sriracha which was an easy fix. We ordered the chicken wings for an appetizer. It was crispy and good. It was packed in this little restaurant but the food came out in a timely manner. My food came out a little bit later than my husband's, but I was fine because I wasn't at the point of being hangry, HAHA. Anyway. The reason why I would give this place 3 stars instead of 4 is because it was hard to enjoy the meal due to the people yelling in the kitchen. There was a man yelling at all of the kitchen staff very aggressively. He kept yelling for the cooks to hurry up and same with the food runners. I suppose there was a moment when the cooks asked for the next order and the main man who was yelling yelled at the server,  SPIT IT OUT! THEY'RE READY!  Really? Just looking and hearing from the outside, it is like their establishment is noy organized at all. I work in a restaurant too so I know how it feels to be under pressure and I know myself that I could not handle a work enviornment like that. As my husband and I continued eating, I even heard the lady who took my order yelling. She told the staff that how busy it was today compared to Christmas is nothing. She yelled,  If you guys can handle Christmas, you can handle this too!  It just didn't give a professional outlook. When I went to the front to pay, I asked him to break my 20 dollar bill so I can tip and he didn't have cash in the drawer so he pulled out his wallet to give me change. I was stunned. I had never seen when employees have to use their own money for exchanging for change for the customers. All in all, if you want something cheap that is not fast food, then I would say this place is for you.

Fueled by good yelp reviews and low prices, we found ourselves at Big Wong.  While the reviews rang true:  the place is 'cheap,' the portions ample, and the service friendly, I found myself disappointed with the lack of color and flavor in each dish.  None of our dishes came with ANY type of veggies, and common sauces found in Asian food (General Tsao's, Sweet n Sour, Orange, etc.)were completely absent from the selection.  We started with the Salt n' Pepper wings, which were the only item I tried that were actually quite tasty.  The downside is they only serve the smaller wing piece, no drums.  Then, we ordered a smorgasbord so that we could sample a bit of this and that.   Beef Ramen:  The beef was tasty, but had just as many pieces of fat as actual meat.  The noodles were a great consistency and the broth had hints of cinnamon.   We realized almost too late that they did give us some green onions on the side to amp up the flavor.   Chicken Curry:  Sandra said it was delicious.  It looked too unappealing for me to try, plus I could tell it was made with stringy dark meat. Fried Chicken with 'Seasoned' Rice:  This was one of the many times our server told me 'NO'.  No, they don't have a fried rice option, No, there are no veggies in the dish.  No, I can't add a few pieces of broccoli to it.  Instead, if I wanted any vegetables, I would have to pay an additional $5.95 for an entire veggie stir fry lunch.  I paid the additional charge for the white meat chicken, which actually had a nice light crunchy coating but had absolutely no seasoning on it.  I found myself wishing I could have this flavored like the Salt n' Pepper wings.  The 'seasoned' rice seemed to have been cooked in a simple broth.  Again, no actual seasoning, no hints of veggies, nada.  This was also served with a questionable looking 'partially boiled egg' that neither of us was willing to try. The Veggie Stir fry:  Because I actually LOVE veggies WAY more than most people, I sprang for the extra full-price charge to have the veggie plate, which was a simple dish of some cross between broccoli rabe and spinach.  There were just as many huge chunks of stalk as leaves.  I cut up some of the leaves and some of the jalapenos that garnished the aforementioned wings, added that to my chicken and rice dish--now I had some flavor.   Did I love Big Wong?  No.  Did I hate it?  No.  Did I take the leftovers home and doctor them up with some peppers, onion, mushroom, sesame oil, soy sauce, pepper, garlic, and cayenne?  You better believe it----that shizzle was delicious.   Bottom line:  If you don't mind your lunch plate consisting of several different shades of beige and/or are eating on a budget, you should find this spot ideal.  Keep your expectations low on the atmosphere and accommodations (we even ate with plastic utensils and drank from Styrofoam cups which were never refilled).  We limped away with a $30 tab for 2 with 1 app, 1 soup, and 2 entrees.  It would have been a bit less, of course, if there were some damned veggies included in the food.", "Date": "2015-10-23", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "A.J.", "ReviewID": "XBD-fIisUeWnu3IsTO6OLQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Excellent food!

Ambiance? Well, it's a classic 'cheap eats, hole-in-the-wall joint', so nuff said. Read about the place in an old Las Vegas Weekly mag and put it on the list of 'places to try'. My guy was hungry for beef ramen, so we had beef ramen, hoi nam chicken with special rice, and salt n pepper chicken wings. The beef ramen was tasty but um... it tasted like pho. The broth had that distinct 'anise' flavor that adding 'five spice' brings. Our first tip off should have been when our chubby waitress said  you want tendons with that?  (we did). If you want your ramen to taste like pho, this is the place. The hoi nam chicken came with special rice and 2 sauces. The rice and sauces made the poached chicken very yummy. The star was the salt n pepper chicken wings. I would go back for them wings and for anything else they serve 'salt n pepper'  style. That was the winner! Our 3 orders set us back about $15, less than a drink at a hi-style restaurant on the Strip, so no complaints about the price. The service was a joke. The chubby waitress with the pony tail and glasses was/is the quintessential inefficient wait help: slow to come over and take your order, slow in bringing the check, all the while acting flustered like she is overwhelmed (the place doesn't have a zillion tables). The party next to us finally got tired of waiting for their check so they just left money on the table and walked out, the chubby waitress barely took notice... guess she figured they left money, so why rush over.

My first visit was on the evening of the opening day.  The place was packed already by about 7pm, and I was glad I grabbed a 6-top for our 7:30pm get together.  Service was hectic, but that is to be expected with the place being so slammed from everyone and their coworker's grandmother stopping by to check out the new Chinese restaurant near the corner of Decatur and Spring Mountain, which serves basically Malaysian, Taiwanese, Cantonese and a little Asian fusion food.  The thing I immediately like about Big Wong is that it has a very basic menu of 17 entrees, which can be consolidated to just 7 main items (i.e., steamed chicken, fried chicken, fried pork chop, curry chicken, wontons, thin ribeye, shrimp). Personally I think the biggest common  mistake restaurateurs make is having way too much items on the menu, where their kitchen is not able to perfect them all.  Better to have a smaller menu and make them all perfectly, I say.  Anyway, I ordered the Hoi Nam Chicken (boneless dark meat) Over Rice - dish with origin in Chinese's Hainanese regional cuisine, which is also very popular in Malaysia and Singaporean due to Chinese immigrants to those countries. The chicken is fine, but I prefer my rice to be more  seasoned .  I have also tried the Fried Chicken Over Rice (boneless) - I really like this one, as the chicken is fried well and is still juicy.  I know I will order this in the future.  The Fired Pork Chop was disappointing for me.  I was expecting it to be more tender and juicy, but it was on the tough side. The minced pork sauce that it was served with help me finish the entree, but I will most likely not try this again.  The Curry with Roti looks good when my dining companions ordered it.  I will try that next time, besides what is not to like about Roti!  The curry itself can be a little less on the  greasy  side, but other than that I heard the flavor was good.  Now that the $1 drink + free entree grand opening promotion is over, we will see if the restaurant can sustain the buzz and continue to draw in a steady flow of customers.  I think at $4.95 (inclusive of tax) it is hard to find a better meal deal cheaper at a sit down restaurant.  And for those who are expecting this to be just another typical Chinese take-out restaurant, you will most likely be disappointed with their menu selection.  You will not find Kung-Pao Chicken or Egg Rolls here. But if you are down to try some different kind of Chinese regional dishes, this is a good place to start without breaking the bank.  ------Version 1.0.1 Update------ Came here after hearing about their House Special Shrimp Wontons from Nelson Q and reading his review.  When I arrived I was told that they also have new menu items that just got added today (Beef Ramen, Shrimp Ramen or Udon and Malaysian Beef Curry over Rice).  I was pretty set to try the shrimp wonton, which was pure shrimp in wonton wrapper.  Yum! The Shrimp Wonton Udon also comes with vegetables, so it is a pretty complete meal.  The new Beef Ramen (made with tender braised beef briskets and tendons) was very good.  The beef broth has a nice flavor, and the brisket and tendons were braised for hours until they are perfectly soft and tender.  It also comes with a really generous portion of ramen, the same kind sourced by Monta Ramen. At $5.95 it is a very good deal, based on the combination of taste, portion size and good culinary execution plus the hours and TLC dedicated to braising the chunks of beef brisket and tendons.  I can see this new Big Wong Beef Ramen as the new featured franchise item for the restaurant. 5-29-2011 ------Version 1.0.1 Update------  Note:  They also have Japanese ramen noodles, which you can substitute for the odon noodles. It is not on the menu, but the manager told me it is available.  ------Version 1.0.2 Update------ Big Wong still serves up solid and wholesome Chinese food, my many repeat visits are proof enough.  One of my favorite is the Steamed Chicken, Mushroom and Chinese Sausage. The congee is great, especially on days when I am not my usual ravenous world devouring self.  12-1-2011 (Update reminder courtesy of Warren P) ------Version 1.0.2 Update------  Decor:  3/5  More attention was used in fitting the 68 seats in the restaurant than the overall look.  Food:  4/5  Now offering soups, appetizers, congee and even desserts!  Location:  4/5  Pretty convenient for those working, shopping or living near the Chinatown area.  Price:  5/5  $4.95 including tax is a good deal for a full meal.  They are definitely going for volume and not high margin per order.

First, I'm NOT a fried won ton fan, because I can make them better than most Chinese restaurants. (True) BUT THIS PLACE makes won tons like they are SUPPOSED to be made!

Instead, THIN, delicate crisp wrappers, and the flavor of FRESH REAL plump chunks of shrimp are allowed to shine through in each bite. When you use fresh, quality shrimp, the flavor of the fresh shrimp is what shines through!  I had the steamed chicken accompanied by gai lan (Chinese broccoli), lap cheong (slices of Chinese sausage) and steamed rice. The vegetables were perfectly crisp tender, the sausage was of good quality (meaning not fatty & salty), and fluffy steamed rice. The dish was a great balance of flavors with the delicately flavorful broth from the steamed chicken.  The prices are cheap, and portions generous, but that does NOT mean this place skimps on quality! If you want Chinese food made with FRESH ingredients and not full of bloating MSG, come here!

Heck, ask my sisters for directions and she can point you in the precise direction.   I'm going to  just come out and say that I'm not exactly a big fan of Big Wong in terms of food. Everytime, the food just looks so darn appetizing. And then I bite into it and am filled with disappointment. I'm not a fan of the Hoi nam chicken, the pork chop with rice, and the ribeye with pasta. The Hoi nam chicken is underseasoned (but the sauces and the rice are delicious), the pork chop can be more crispy, and the sauce that is supposed to go with the pasta provides no taste for the pasta. So yeah, there is a huge lack of flavor sometimes.   So why 4 stars? Lord, the prices. Most of the dishes are $4.95. Yes. There is still a place in Las Vegas you can eat for $5 that does not consist of In-n-out or tiny slices of pizza.

The chicken wings are superb. the ribeye is actually pretty good and I usually just order that and take the noodles to go (then douse it with something else), the sizzling plate veggies are amazing (ask the old Asian guy who does everything for it!), the shrimp wontons hit the right spot, and the beef ramen is a combination of college dorm life and fancy gourmet ramen shop. You are guaranteed to leave STUFFED.  Just a warning though. Don't come here and expect perfect customer service. This is a Chinese restaurant son!

Expect comfort food at insanely cheap prices and you'll leave a happy customer.   The parking also sucks because Big Wong shares the same parking lot with Vegas favorites, Kung Fu Tea and Monta Ramen.

Why can't they smile a little more? Like another reviewer said, we always said thank you, when being seated, when the drinks came, when the food came, we said thank you.

The first time I went there I asked very politely if they have a bathroom (i asked after placing orders), and the lady was giving me an irritated look, as if I was a fool to ask.  I think the food is cheap because they only have so few employees there. And I guess that's why there is no good service, I think anyone could go postal if one has to do everything with no help.

Was gonna go to SnowFlake Shavery but didn't have dinner yet so we decided to check out this Wong place. After looking over the menu, I was astounded by how simple it was laid out and explained. Most dishes were around the 5 to 6 dollar range. I was excited that it was pretty cheap and at the same time cautious because of the quality you might get because of it.   First visit I ordered the Shrimp Wonton with Udon noodles and the wifey ordered the Rice Vermiccelli Noodle Soup which she shared with my youngest son. We were all amazed at how hot and fresh both dishes were especially with how fast we received it too. The Shrimp Wonton mixed with Udon Noodles were some of the best Wonton I have had in a while. As for the the other dish my wife and son shared, it was basically a pho bowl, which was pretty good as well.  I was impressed so we came back the next day for lunch to try some of the other items. Our second visit verified that this place was gonna be one of our go to places for good, cheap fast food. What we got this time was the Beef Ramen, Salt n Pepper Porkchop, and Thinly Sliced Ribeye over Rice.    The Beef Ramen has your basic Ramen Noodles accompanied by tender chunks of Beef Brisket which gave the overall taste of the soup tremendous flavor. The Salt n Pepper Porkchop was exactly that. A deep fried Porkchop lightly coated in salt and pepper, then sliced and garnished with thinly sliced sauteed jalapenos. When you bite into it, all the flavors put together are like a really good orchestra playing in your mouth. I asked for some sweet chili sauce on the side to dip it in and some steamed white rice to accompany it. As for the Thinly Sliced Ribeye, it comes with an au jus type of of gravy to dip it in and then you eat it it with the steamed white rice. Really good flavors from this as well.  The overall total with tax and tip was around 20 dollars. Not bad for all the food I just mentioned!   Service was decent. They would come around refilling our drinks every so often so I never really had to ask for any refills.   So if you want good food at low prices with decent service, you can't go wrong at Big Wongs!

From where I sat I could see directly into the kitchen and that entertained me watching the chef prepare the dishes.

The chicken wings had a generous amount of jalapenos and that made me happy.  The bok choy was generously seasoned with garlic.  It was good but glad I didn't have to kiss anybody that day!  I liked that the bok choy was very young and so it made it easy to eat.  As I was sipping on my tea looking around I began to notice a few things.  There are a number of brightly colored posters on the walls.  A suggestion to the management if I may:  I don't see your patrons going around and reading the posters.  The posters don't send a positive marketing message overall.  I think it would look better to take them down and either don't replace with anything or maybe a few pictures on a theme.

Fish ball curry, well I guess I don't like Malaysian style curry I won't get any curry dishes since Malay is the base for their curry. Chicken wings, umm...really salty and not any other flavor...  I want to like this place.  The restuarant is really, really clean.  I think the lady owner has OCD in a good way, she spays and clean table right after customers leave...a BIG THUMBS UP!!!  They are really nice and courteous and the cook is constantly asking me what he can do to make this place better.  I told him the price is right so far, they will have more business if they can improve the flavor of the food.

Fast forward to this weekend when he suggested that we hang out. I asked if he wanted to  show me how good Big Wong can be,  and he obliged.  This game-changing dish was the ~$5 Hainan boneless dark meat chicken with seasoned rice (#2 on the menu). We actually split an extra order of seasoned rice, leaving us plenty to go around. The chicken and rice were both quite tasty and sufficiently seasoned, and I liked both the soy and the spicy sauces that accompanied the dish. I would certainly recommend this place as a cheap lunch (and an excuse to hit up Snowflake Shavery for dessert).  We didn't get appetizers, but I'll stand by the curry chicken with roti and the salt and pepper chicken wings from my first visit.

My boy and I got an order of their house special wonton noodle soup, salt and pepper chicken wings and order of ong choy ( water spinach ) made with garlic.   The wontons were fresh and the snap to the shrimp were on point. The egg noodles were a bit too springy for me and wasn't what I was used to.

The special was 2 for 1 Beef Ramen so I partnered up with Paolo to grab the deal. The whole thing was a cross of different kinda of soups- between a pho soup and oxtail soup with ramen noodles. The meat and tendon (you can ask with or without) was plentiful and tender so it was stewed long enough. Ramen noodles was quite a lot (more than Monta next door) and had good bite. Soup base was clear and clean broth, but that meant to me I needed to dress it up a bit with green onion, soy sauce, hot sauce to suit my taste. I was hungry since I didn't have lunch and this was super filling.   Some people came at different times so we just kinda sat and hung out for hours. By the time people were trickling out the BF was there off work so it was dinner time.   We shared-  Deep Fried Pork Chop (asked crispy)- Pretty good meat and I like the gravy sauce they give you and the soy boiled egg.   Thin Sliced Ribeye- it was tender meat with a bit of fat on it so it's not for the lean beef sliced people. C'mon- it's ribeye. This also came with the gravy sauce and I think it went even better with the ribeye than the chop.   Chicken curry w/ roti- the curry had good flavor and had a good sized piece of chicken (bone in) and potato. The roti was light, flaky and very hot so it's made to order. This was both my BF and my favorite and I will definitely grab this again.   I had lunch here (about $3 for my half of the 2 for 1), dinner here and the BF had dinner here ($16 for 3 plates and 2 drinks).  I spent about $25 total with tax and tip....that's crazy! Food ranges from $4.95- $8max so its cheap and filling.   The service here was friendly and good. We were checked on, water cups were filled often.

With all the great things said about this place by people's whose reviews I respect, I thought it would be better than it was.  I just barely give 3 stars.  I was contemplating two and a half.  I was greeted promptly on arrival and asked if I was getting take out or eating in.  The woman told me to sit anywhere I wanted because I was eating in and she gave me their small menu.  I had seen several people rave about the curry chicken with roti so that's what I ordered.  In a short time, the cook brought out a bowl of curry chicken and a plate with three very hot, fresh roti.    The curry chicken was good but it would be better named curry potato with chicken and roti.  I had two large chunks of potato, one large cube of chicken (smaller that either of the two potato pieces), while the rest was curry sauce with some chicken shreds.  The curry was tasty and the roti were very good.  As I waited for my dinner to be brought, I noticed on their wall--which has a lot of homemade signs for new dishes--that the curry chicken was listed under appetizers.  No wonder the price is only $4.95.  No wonder the portion is much less than a curry chicken you'd get in a Thai restaurant, and for $4.95 I wasn't expecting that.  I was going to order something else, perhaps some ramen or just a pudding for dessert.  There were two customers including myself in this small place that has a maximum capacity of 68 people.  All the time I waited for my order and ate, the woman was on the phone--not taking orders--but chatting.  If she wasn't on the phone, she was putting business cards in a plastic holder in a notebook and she was engrossed with that task rather than all two of her customers--the other who ordered directly from the cook and had no interaction with the woman.  After waiting approximately five minutes for her to get off the phone or at least look my way so I could get her attention, I got up to leave.  I approached the counter and she told whomever was on the phone to hold, she took, my money, gave me change, and went back to her telephone.  I don't think I'll return.  If it's like this when they're two people there, what would it be like when they're busy--say ten people.  It's just not worth it.

The Shrimp Wonton were OK, but nothing else special about the noodle soup.  Hainan Chicken lacked flavor and was dry.

At first, I was hesitant to dine there because I thought it was going to be the same as most other Chinese restaurants. It took me several times passing by until I finally gave it a try and now, I dine there almost every week! (no joke!)  This place is AMAZING!  Granted, upon walking in, the establishment is not as nicely decorated as most other restaurants. BUT DON'T LET THE LACK OF INTERIOR DESIGN FOOL YOU!  The food here is delicious and the cheapest in town (NO TAX ! )   I always order their fried shrimp wonton ($4.95 .. 10-12 pieces) The wontons are served with sweet chili sauce. What makes them so good is the whole shrimp that is stuffed inside. They are also super, super crispy and delicious as appetizers.  I also suggest getting their beef ramen, or wonton soup. ($5.95) .. The broth they make is very sweet and flavorful. It isn't bland like other places. The portions they give you is also very considerate.  I also love their sizzling garlic sauteed vegetables. (only $6.95) They serve it on an iron plate that they bring out to you smoking and sizzling. Every time someone orders it, the whole restaurant smells like garlic! It is so delicious and perfect to eat with rice! You can also order it with thai chili which adds an amazing spice. The blend of garlic and chili is absolutely perfect.  The last thing I would definitely recommend is their Authentic Hai Nam Chicken. The rice that is served is cooked in chicken broth so you get the full flavor of chicken in every bite. The chicken itself (cut in pieces, either dark or white meat) is steamed in ginger and garlic. I love this plate! The aroma of the marinated chicken is so flavorful in your mouth. You get two different types of dipping sauce with the dish. A semi sweet soy sauce and an amazing semi sweet chili dipping sauce. Both of these sauces are great with the chicken!.. The portions are also very filling!  As for desserts, I would recommend their sweet Rotti ($1) .. It is pretty much a crispy fried tortilla with condense milk and powdered sugar. I was super surprised how delicious these 3 combinations taste together!I It is very simple but very tasty! ---  The only con I would give to BW is that they don't have a very extensive drink/ dessert menu. Just be prepared for can sodas and about only 3 selections of desserts. However, the entree selections are plentiful.   Overall, if you haven't tried BW yet, you are missing out!

My husband didn't  like it for that exact reason, but I was swooning.  It must have taken a lot of shrimp heads to pack that much flavor into that bowl.

She promptly sat us down and we said thanks and she doesn't even acknowledge it, just walks off. I was a little put off by the service but I just shrugged it off. We looked at the menu and we ordered a plate of the chicken wings to share between us, the beef ramen for my boyfriend, the double Fish ball noodle soup for me, and two Thai teas.

We then got our food. My boyfriend thought his ramen was okay, nothing special. I thought my noodle soup was bland beyond words. The soup tasted really watered down, I had to put in a ton of sriracha to give it any flavor at all. The wings were really good though, that was worth every penny.   Some things bugged me a little during our visit there though. The kitchen is within full view to the restaurant which means I can hear the staff in there talking. At one point, I heard one of the guys in there raise his voice to another guy about not working hard enough? It was pretty loud and was a little unprofessional.

Though we missed the  Dollar Dining,  we are very happy to have discovered this place. Luckily, my parents saved the flyer and after seeing the prices on their menu, we asked,  why not?  We went there this past Sunday evening and met the owners Wai (or was it Wayne?) and Connie and their  regulars  Judd and Lynn. Luck would have it, we are all avid cruisers. Woo Hoo...one can never have too few cruising buddies!   Back to why we are here: the food. Big Wong's menu is limited to one page and some posted specials on the wall. After discussing the menu with Wai and Connie, their philosophy is to keep the menu simple and ensure their food is always consistent and at a reasonable price. Mission accomplished!   I had the Hainan Chicken and my wife had the Curry Chicken. The flavoring of the Hainan style chicken was delicate and tender. You dip the chicken into the accompanying chili sauce or soy/sesame oil sauce. The included seasoned rice was fluffy and also delicately seasoned. The chicken curry was wonderful and included potatoes, however, I like a little more  kick  in my curry. Spiciness is such a subjective matter and I understand you cannot please everyone. Some people may just complain that it is too spicy. You can't subtract spiciness, but you can always add. Connie also brought a sample of their beef stew and let me tell you, the beef was so tender and delicious! Both of our portions are satisfying and don't let the price fool you. You definitely get your money's worth here!   Looking forward to becoming regulars at Big Wong and try out their ramen and wontons.  Update 6/5/11-Since writing this review, we have been back two more times and today with my parents. I have had the Beef Ramen, Ribeye over Pasta, and my wife had the Shrimp Wontons twice. Big Wong's Beef Ramen is exquisite. They spend a lot of time preparing the bite-size chunks of beef and tendons by trimming out the fat and un-chewable membrane that you find in Chinese style beef stew. Every piece is satisfyingly tender. I asked Wai how is the broth prepared and he told me directly from the stew. Delicious and hearty. No MSG after taste here.  The wontons (immersed in a flavorful broth) are loaded with shrimp and no pork filler used here. The ribeye is also very tender and juicy (cooked medium) and comes with a pepper style gravy that you pour yourself and a sliced herbed potato.  6/17/11-Went to our first UYE here at Big Wongs. It was great to meet other Yelpers.  6/19/11-Wai has been telling me about his Dungeness Crab over rice noodles (horfun) special and I had to give it a try so we came back today. The fresh crab is steamed with ginger and served over the rice noodles with it's natural sweet crab juice.

But hey, it was a dollar, so I can't really complain. Even at their standard $4.95 prices, this turns out to be a decent stop for a quick lunch. Sure, it's nothing memorable, but it's got value on its side.  For starters, I ordered an regular iced tea to go with my meal. Disappointingly, it just turned out to be a canned Lipton Brisk tea. Not my usual forte; but then again, the meal was too cheap to make any complaints about. Service still remained to be prompt and friendly.  For the entrée, I went with the chicken curry. It tasted a lot like my home cooking. You'd think that'd be complementary, but I am a terrible cook. In terms of flavors, it was average. But, it ended up being a filling meal. Don't count on waiting for your food, since it was practically served to me as quickly as the drink came out.  As I mentioned earlier, this place was nothing to write home about. I needed a quick lunch fix, and I got it for a good value. I will probably give it another go tomorrow for the last day of the $1 promotion.

Surely shin ramyun should be fine!  That got old reeeaaal fast. So I began frequenting somewhere familiar - I had been to Big Wong several times and it was the perfect fit...  The downlow: It's cheap, filling, and tasty.  I don't know what's better than 8 pieces of salt and pepper chicken wings (topped with jalapeños) for 4 dollars. That's 50 cents a wing!! Cheaper than BWW's 60 cent deal and also much larger and more delicious.  Besides the wings, I like to get shrimp wonton soup with egg noodles ($4) or the chicken with rice ($4). You can even choose the cuts of chicken you want, so I always go dark. When I'm eating with others, I like to get the sizzling ong choy ($5) which is a surprisingly HUGE hot plate. It's stir fried morning glory and tastes just like home. Portions are always generous. Seriously, I ordered the shrimp wonton soup thinking it would hold me over until my next meal but it got me stuffed! That little bowl is quite deceiving.  Other notable dishes are the chicken or beef curry, which you can dip roti (Asian crispy pancake) in and the sirloin beef with rice. Pretty much everything you order here will be good or reeeaaally good. It's no-frills food for those that are on a budget. The only thing I don't like that much is the salt and pepper pork because it isn't crispy.   Fare warning, the service isn't that spectacular. It's always the same lady working as cashier and serving/bussing tables so be patient. Aside from that, her brusque manner of speaking can be off-putting for those that put service as a priority.

The food is good for the value, there is no doubt. The least impressive item was the braised beef, which featured small pieces of beef drowning in bland beef sludge.   The service is some of the worst I have seen, and I am no stranger to the curt, no nonsense style that is typical to Chinese restaurants. The lady who was working the counter and taking orders was just plain mean. I saw her yell at a group of customers for wanting to sit at a different table...she literally glared at them for a minute and then finally brought them their menus. We wanted to order more food halfway through the meal. After failing to get her attention we went up to the counter, and were told that our order would be placed at the very end of the queue in this crowded restaurant. Fine! No more food!

The chicken was very basic considering it was their regional specialty. The salt and pepper fish came deep fried (unexpected) but was remarkably good, especially dipped in one of he provided spicy sauces. The Bok Choy was relatively basic taste wise but cooked to perfection.   All in all the food came out quickly, the prices were great, and the experience went well.

Went last night with the hubby around 10:30 pm (they close at 11pm) there were two tables of customers one of which the owner was sitting at. She got up quickly and welcomed us in. We ordered several dishes to share. Beef ramen, shrimp wonton soup(no noodles), salt and pepper chicken wings and fried shrimp wontons.The order of fried wontons came out in less than 5 minutes! they were all shrimp and delicious but just a tad bit greasy. Beef ramen and wonton soup came next. Hubby started to eat the ramen and I could tell after two bites he was so not into it. My wonton soup was great..filled with tender all shrimp wontons nice greens and a very soothing broth. I said lets switch. He gladly gave me the big bowl of ramen( have to say the portion for 4.95 is quite large) The noodles were okay(not overcooked which for me would be a huge sin for ramen) the beef was tender but fatty and the broth..eww just not for us. Then came the chicken wings just in time to save the day! OMG! So delicious! Perfectly crispy skin and amazingly juicy with just the right amount of spice. Would go again just for the wings! The chef and owner came by to ask how everything was and noticed right away the still full bowl of ramen and asked what was wrong. We told them the noodles were good and beef was okay ..the broth just not to our taste. They explained to us they use plain broth in their ramen (not seasoned and no msg). We said no problem three out of four is not bad . We were soon finished and got the check. I was a little surprised they didn't take the ramen off the bill but I didn't feel that bad cause it was only 4.95. But having been a small business owner myself..I would have instantly taken it off the bill. Nonetheless I think they might get a second visit from me.

They don't skimp out on the meat and comes with a side of steamed potatoes.

I rate 3STARS for one reason only...the SHRIMP WONTONS, um DELISH yea!  It's nothing super fancy, very simple item.  I came across this item by default, I actually walked in for a killer egg roll but this restaurant does not sell EGG ROLLS.  and the lady looked at me like I had 2 heads and I asked for egg rolls.  I'm sorry lady, my mistake, I thought all Chinese Food restaurant serve egg rolls, they do in California.   Ok, I'm getting sidetracked here.....so no egg rolls but she suggested that I tried their Shrimp Wontons instead...   -Shrimp - Wonton Wrappers - Deep Fried Goodness - served w/ a sweet and sour chili sauce.  all for $4.95 - 8pcs  Crispy, not soggy or saturated w/ oil.  Made to order, I always do take out, they are sealed in a foil heat bag to keep them warm and crunchy.    This is so a MOM and POP joint, no fancy digs here.  I have never tried anything else on the menu because it does not appeal to me, I go there for one thing and one thing ONLY!!!

Hahahaha. I died of laughter. Good thing I've had  Big Wong  on the radar so our miscommunication was short lived and our friendship was spared.  The UYE was a success and of course, we over-ordered: have you seen those prices!?! The restaurant is a small, unassuming, very hole-in-the-wall, but tidy Chinese spot located in the prime of Chinatown near the likes of Kung Fu Tea (my go-to Boba shop) and other heavy food-hitters like Raku and Curry House Zen.  I ordered a nice dinner-sized portion of (Hai Nam or Hoi Nam on their menu) chicken rice and it was only $4.95! Other known as Hainanese chicken rice, the chicken is poached and then the rich stock cooks and gives aromatic flavor to the rice. Here you can choose between all white meat, dark meat without bone, or dark meat with bone. I went for the dark meat without bone and it was pretty legit. The chicken was plentiful, very moist and the dark meat had lots of flavor. I felt that the rice could have used a little bit more seasoning and aromatic flavor, though the 2 dipping sauces made up for it. There was a slightly sweet, dark soy sauce and also a reddish ginger sauce - that was my favorite. The ginger was extremely aromatic and gave the chicken a lot of freshness and pops of character. Flavor rating: 4/5  We also tried: Garlic steamed bok choy - very good! The steamed bok choy, still had a slight bite to them and soaked up a lot flavor from all of the garlic bits. Flavor rating: 5/5  Shrimp and wonton noodle soup - We felt that this noodle soup was average. The wontons committed the worst offense: not enough filling. Don't skimp! The egg noodles were abundant and cooked al dente and the broth was simple, but decent. The whole shrimp also had a strange, off-putting mealy texture to them. Flavor rating: 2/5  Ribs in Black Bean sauce - the meat was tender but overall flavor was muted so we weren't too sure what to make of the black bean sauce? This was our least favorite dish. Flavor rating: 2/5  Roti with curry $4.95 - Malaysian style crispy and buttery flat bread/ pancake that is served glistening, crisp and hot. The curry had lovely spices and a tad bit of heat. Plus, they did not skimp on the chicken and potatoes - there were huge chunks in the bowl. Flavor rating: 4/5  The crispy Roti pancakes were my favorite and truly the best I've ever had. They are super flaky, not too oily, and had an extremely addictive butter flavor that almost tasted like a buttery croissant! Flavor rating: 5/5  Big Wong is doing something different in Vegas; keeping it homey, keeping it simple, keeping it affordable.

Am a cheap eater?  No.  But was hoping this was that rare place that served good food at super low prices.  Basically, a place where they realizes their prices are too low but are too afraid to alienate their new customers.  Verdict?  Kind of.  Had the pork chop over rice and beef ramen. 1) Pork chop over rice - I'm told you have to ask for it crispy to get it...crispy.  Not sure why they do that.  I did not know this when ordering so was disappointed at the lack of...crispiness.  It was also underseasoned.  Definitely added a lot of salt to this bad boy.  Otherwise it was pretty good.  The egg that came with it had a nice, soft yolk in the middle.  My mom just learned how to cook the eggs that way and we both agree it's awesome.  Ask for this dish crispy and you won't be disappointed. 2) Beef ramen - Again....underseasoned.  But have to say this is some of the best beef I've had here in Las Vegas.  Nice and soft with a lot of flavor.  Just wish they added more salt or soy sauce to the soup base.  The noodles themselves aren't great - basically the ramen you'd get in most instant ramen.  Nothing like the ramen at Monta.  But the overall dish is pretty awesome.  Definitely a step below Monta but at half the price.  I could eat that beef with any dish and be happy.  Overall....a good option and happy they opened.  I can't say that about most of the Asian restaurants in town.  Most of what we have is a dime a dozen.

They're tender and are NOT chewy, AND they ask you if you want tendons in your soup. (UH, HELL YES I DO!) The broth is clear and perfectly seasoned, and the noodles are the eggy hong-kong style that I wish I had more experience in reviewing. But they were really tasty to me.

I forget the name of the dish but that's what I remember eating.  The positives here are that the roti (similar to a green onion pancake) was decent. It had the bread taste. The potatoes- the curry supplied all the flavor. When you bit inside and ate inside, you got absolutely zippo taste. Nothing, Nada. Zilch. It was bland. The chicken was a bit better, because it was soft, and it was in strips so the curry could actually soak into the chicken, but wasn't too impressed. Curry was watered down. A lot.  Had one shrimp wonton because there were many reviews about it. You can taste the shrimp but it was just missing some flavor to the point of being decent.  The reason why Big Wong is popular is because of them having really cheap prices. Which they do. Shrimp wonton is $4.95, and most of the prices do go along that route.

Getting our drink beverage orders out of the way, it was easy to decide amongst their 15 item menu.  I went for their Hoi Nam Chicken ($4.95).  They have three variations of it and I went for the Boneless Dark Meat version.  It was surprisingly moist and decent portioned.  Yes, I've had better and I've also had a lot worse (especially in Vegas) but it was decent.  The seasoned rice that accompanied it could be a bit more seasoned but it worked.  The Husband had their Shrimp Wonton Soup ($4.95).  This soup came with six generous all shrimp dumplings and some Chinese vegetables.  You have to give them credit for making it a very shrimpy dumpling with no filler.    We didn't realize that their grand opening special was limited to one per person per visit, so we went ahead and ordered another beverage to score a couple more free entrees.  This time I went for the Curry Chicken with Roti Pancakes ($4.95).  I loved their version of the roti, not overly greasy and had a nice flaky texture and crunch.  The curry with chicken and potatoes had a good flavor too.  The Husband tried their Deep Fried Pork Chop ($4.95) and found it to be disappointing.  It wasn't quite what we expected and it was dried out.  Too bad about that one.  (Apparently you have to request crispy if you want it that way...but that's news to us!)  When it came time to pay, we then discovered that we were going to be charged for the second entrees.  Due to a waitress's mistake, they took it off the bill without any hassle, which is something we really appreciated.  They didn't even charge us for the second round of beverages, rather telling us to leave it for our server instead.  Now, you gotta love that!   Overall, you can't complain for the price you're getting.  A decent size portion for less than five bucks, and that's including tax!  (I heard they are adding to their menu next week, so we'll see how that goes.)

If you want to fill your stomach with good food, then you are at the right place. If you want relaxing, excellent customer services, then you are at the wrong place, the strip is the place you should go.  I came here due to the Yelp's reviews for dinner, it is not a very big restaurant, the table seating setup is good for group of 4 to 6 persons, if you have more than 6 in your group, then you are expecting a longer wait, or separating into 2 tables.  Now for the food, we ordered the Hainan Chicken Rice and the fried shrimp wonton. The Hainan Chicken Rice is the best I tasted so far in West Coast. Their Hainan Chicken Rice is very similar to Thai style chicken rice, I would say about 95% similar. The chicken meat has very good tender, not too soft or too hard, and I believe the rice is steam cooked with the chicken soup, because by just eating the rice itself, it is already very tasty. For the fried shrimp wonton, it is very crispy and the shrimp is fresh too. I would recommended these two choices.  For services, I would agree they are out-staff, so you have to be patient with them. Especially the lady waitress, she has to do everything from taking order, serving, cleaning/setup table, take phone order and cashier. So be patient.  We even came back the next day for our lunch.

Thanks to our trusty Yelp app, we fond Big Wong's and was impressed by the # of positive reviews for a place that has seemingly RIDICULOUSLY low prices!  I'm from the San Gabriel area so I'm accustomed to cheap food, but Big Wong's pricing is almost TGTBT and makes you question what ingredients they use....  However, 3 days after my meal, I have survived w/o any gastrointestinal isues and in fact, feel pretty good (thanks to my cheap meal @ Big Wong's!)  As for the venue itself, it is located in the heart of the Las Vegas  Chinatown  (but feels more like Westminster) area and is within a smal strip mall with numerous other asian-based restaurants and businesses (foot massage anyone?)  Once you enter Big Wong, you'll see a traditionally simple restaurant, clean, bare, and most likely somewhat empty.  However don't be offput by the lack of lines like at Marquee or XS, this is a good thing :)  The menu options are actually quite expansive, and include many many recognizable (and comfortable when you're tired/hungover) items.  I had the  thin ribeye with rice  dish that was okay in taste; a bit lean on the meat, heavy on the white rice, but my standard were so freaking low that I was still happy.  The sauce it comes with is a bit bland....so I wouldn't recommend this dish unless you are really looking to eat light.    My companions tried the Hainan chicken, which was average..but my standards are based on Savoy's kitchen which has the best Hainan Chicken known to my existanec.  My other friend had a pho-like noodle dish that he said tasted good and it was pretty sizeable.  Finally, we all shared a portion of crispy chicken wings which I actually enjoyed! Not too oily or greasy, nice and flavorful with unidentifiable spices/seasonings.    Every single item we ordered was $4.95 which INCLUDES TAX!!!

Am I being hyper-critical? I don't think so, my white husband also thought the food was below average.   Then there's the service. I know many Chinese restaurants don't win over customers with friendly service but this guy really takes the cake. He doesn't greet you, just points to a table and tells you to go sit. I heard him speak Chinese speak with his kitchen staff but when customers speak to him in Chinese he pretends he doesn't understand.

Very good. My son had the special shrimp wonton soup and Mr. Picky-eater scarfed most of it down. We brought the leftovers home & he just finished off the last of it.

Anywhere else would have run us $50-$70.  The restaurant was small, but very clean and they keep the kitchen open to view, and it was very evident the owners take a lot of pride in keeping things clean and hygienic. The ladies restroom was a pleasant surprise. Very well appointed and very clean. Usually, restrooms in most restaurants can be a bit scary. I say if the owners put this much attention on cleanliness and quality in their restrooms, an area often overlooked by other eating establishments, then they must put even more emphasis on cleanliness in the kitchen and the quality of the food. In this case, I'm right. All through the meal, I heard the chef (owner?) directing the cooks with cautions on not to overcook this, oversteam that, etc...

Nothing really beats a meal and drink for one dollar.   Would I go back to this place with their normal prices? Probably.  Would I come back here often? Probably not.   On my first visit I indulged and ordered two items. First off was the fried pork chop. It was disappointing to say the least. It was kind of bland and chewy. The sauce that accompanied it was pretty tasty though.The highlight of the dish was the perfecly cooked boiled egg that came with it, which provided for a nice surprise. The second item ordered was their wonton soup. This was actually quite good. The wontons were cooked well and the broth was good. It had nice flavor without being too salty.   The second time going, I ordered their hainan chicken [which is served cold by the way, as it helps keep the chicken tender]. The chicken was mediocre. But how nice can cold steamed chicken really get? The rice that accompanies it is supposed to be 'seasoned.' I didn't taste much of a difference between that and their regular white rice though. I guess the highlight of the dish were the two sauces that come with. Mix em together, and you have a killer sauce which makes up for the rest of the dish. I'd probably order this dish again, just to get the sauce.   All in all, the service is pretty good. I was surprised that everyone was being so friendly, considering the hectic days they must have had opening the restaurant. And the quickness of the food coming out was great as well. Their prices are pretty decent as well. There's nothing for more than five dollars, and all prices are tax included.   So, if you want a cheap Chinese meal, definitely come here. And just a side note - if you go hungry, I'd avoid ordering the pork chop. The serving size is a lot smaller compared to the chicken.

It was a fish comparable to Monta soy broth noodles. The also ordered the ong choy sautéed with garlic. Very good!!! Lastly to top off dinner we ordered the lychee and almond pudding.

No, that's not a typo, it's true. FREE. The three amigos ate for $3 dollars (plus tip) last night.   Newly remodeled with fresh yellow paint and ZERO items on the wall (perhaps not to distract from the food?), Big Wongs appeared to be clean and hoppin.   Seated at the very last table, conveniently located next to the hallway leading to the restrooms we placed our beverage order. Our canned soda's arrived in a timely fashion, unlike our food.   The number list of menu items was pretty small, but based on observation, I believe their is an  off the menu  option for things such as bok choy (which we found no where on the list). We chose our  numbers  and placed our order then commenced witty conversations amongst ourselves.   .............OK, so there's not enough time, or A.D.D. medication for me to input enough dots to represent the length of time we waited for our meals, but it was a while (*clears throat*, 40 minutes). We received our food, one dish at a time and about 5 to 15 minutes in between each other, but I would say despite the wait, the food was actually quite tasty!   I will give them a small exception that it was in fact their opening night and all, but common..Your menu is tiny, your items are numbered and the Restaurant seats about 10 tables MAX.

The fried chicken aside, most of their dishes don't classify as  greasy Chinese food.  Here are some of my favorites:  - Hoi nam (Hainan) chicken over rice: This is one of my favorites. The seasoned rice is the bee's knees. It comes in three variations: white meat, dark meat, and bone-in dark meat.  - Special deep fried chicken over rice: This rice isn't seasoned, but it does come with a pretty tasty sauce. The fried chicken is more flavorful than the steeped Hainan chicken, but also more greasy. I like the dark meat version of this dish.  - Curry chicken served with (3) roti pancakes: The roti pancakes are amazing. A great curry dish if you're craving something more Malaysian.   - Beef ramen: This is possibly the most underrated dish on the entire menu. The eggs are perfectly soft-boiled and I love the beef. Each piece is super tender and probably braised for a long time.   - Salt and pepper chicken wings: Perfectly fried and a great appetizer or side to share with the table.

The main thing Big Wong's has going for it is the price - everything's pretty cheap. For 2 dishes and 3 drinks, our bill was like $10. Also, the service was very fast and friendly. I asked if they had milk for the kids, and even though they don't serve it, the waitress was nice enough to get a couple glasses for us for $1 each.

She was rude starting day one, we ignore it, hoping that she becomes more polite. But she's the most horrible server.  Her energy is almost hateful. You have to make a loud noise to request any attention from her and sometimes that is not enough, she will ignore you talking to her sometime as well, and then you have to get up and go to her with any request, including if you want to order extra food. She never ask if you need anything, she acts like she's pissed off even when you try to pay. I feel a little sorry for the owner, she is costing him money because if people want to order extra food, his restaurant will profit more but the waitress always treats you like she's angry if you ask her for anything, including ordering or paying your bill.

There is a great selection on the menu... rice, noodles, soups, curries, vegetables, etc. A daily special is listed on the wall.   Their ramen and udon noodle soups are FANTASTIC; however, they are missing vegetables. It's just noodles and broth with meat in the bowl or on the side. They do provide a metal container of green onions to add to the soup, but I think the dishes would be 5 stars if they had more substance (onions, cabbage, bamboo, etc..)

This is just to help them improve.  Their service sucks.  Everything is about $5 dollars.  The lady who has helped us both times is always alone. I'm sure it sucks for her. This is a prime location in the surrounding China Town area so I know it gets busy. There's about twenty people in here now.   Anyways the food I really good. I've had their special spicy seafood soup with wontons and their beef ramen. Both were pretty good. The shrimp and wontons in the soup were of good quality. The beef ramen has a pretty basic beef flavor. There isn't even any taste of like ginger or even onion. The beef itself is cooked really soft. I've tried their chicken wings and their shrimp won tons. Both were good. The wings are seasoned well and came out hot quick and fresh. The shrimp wontons are also good. Both are good sizes for $5 each.  Anyways they give you super small water cups.  So here is my gripe. They have a menu item called 5., 5a, and 5b. It's their special deep fried chicken. One is bone in dark meat, One is bone out dark meat, and they have a boneless white meat. The dish is really good. The dark meat takes 25 minutes but it's worth it.   So my sister got the bone out dark and my cousin the bone out white meat.  The server comes out and brings pork chops. So we spoke amongst ourselves like who ordered this?  And she's like it's number three deep fried pork chops.  I ordered soup so I know it's not mine.  But we are all positive that they got chicken.  She just walks off and says well you ordered that and shrugs her shoulders and walks off.  No arguing with that right?  So she ends up walking back and says it's wrong it goes somewhere else.  Needless to say she messed up.  There was no apology for the mix up or for blaming us.  Also we never got our drinks refilled. Not once.  Anyways I'll probably just order take out from here.

Salt and pepper pork chops: these were also nicely fried with the lovely jalapeños as well AND they came out SLICED, unlike other places, so I really did appreciate that!

The noodles were okay as well, not too chewy or soggy. I had the waitress add some tendon in addition to the meat since I wanted to see if they stewed the meat long enough. Big Wong did pass with flying colors in this department. The meat and tendon were cooked until nice tender and soft. The dish also came with a small dish of chopped green onions and hot sauce if you wanted.

There was only one other party of 2 and 3 empty tables left with dirty dishes on them. After receiving our order, which came out pretty quickly, we waited to ask for water. However, no one came out for a while, so we had to go up to the register and wave into the kitchen for service. Actually had to get up and wave them down a few times throughout our meal. Not cool. ALSO can they please get some real utensils?? The plastic stuff bends when you pick up food. No bueno  -__-   FOOD: -Chicken and Rice: I got this because of the good yelp reviews. Compared to a lot of other places that serve this, Big Wong does it all wrong! It comes with no condiments, unless you specifically ask them for each one. Chicken was dry and didn't seem very flavorful and the rice wasn't hot.  -Wonton Soup: The portion size is good, not too huge, but enough to fill you up. The soup was bland though, we added soy sauce, pepper, ginger sauce, chili oil...basically whatever was on the table just to give it some flavor.   PASS.

The first time I had the Hainan chicken and the shrimp won tons with ramen  The hainan chicken and the dipping sauce was  solid and the rice was flavorful.            Shrimp won ton ramen was tasty, the won tons had whole pieces of shrimp inside. I know some people rave about this but I prefer a  minced shrimp filling with water chestnuts , green onions etc.  The broth was clear and flavorful , the ramen was cooked perfectly.                              My second trip ordered the crispy pork chop, but got the crispy chicken instead, no problem I can adapt. The problem was the chicken lacked flavor and the dipping sauce was the pan drippings and was not very good.   I also had the beef curry  with rice and no tendons,  ,glad they asked  if I wanted tendon's given choice I rather eat meat then tendons.  I'll eat tendons if I'm still hungry and its the only thing left on my plate.              The beef curry was very good and more then made up for the crispy chicken.  I rate the food a very solid  3 stars and with the great service and super value it gets another star .

After talking hubby into trying out  a place I found on yelp  he agreed so on we went. So we enter BW and only 2 tables have people. We ask for 3 plus a high chair. She goes to the back and grabs the high chair but as shes placing it at the farthest table she yells  I'm seating you in the back okay!  uummm sure. Now I don't give a crap where we sit buuuut don't yell at my family please, thank you. This is about the time my hubby started giving me the stink eye. Took all of about 15 seconds after walking in. The lady comes back with the menus and I pretty much had an idea of what I wanted but hubby had to peruse. We ordered tea with lemon, sprite, and a water for my kids. She brought our drinks and my daughter(shes 4) started taking the lid off the lady was like  no no no, I spent all morning cleaning the floors, keep the lid on  now if this lady had been playing around it would be one thing. BUT SHE WASN'T!! Don't parent my children!   Now on to the food. Salt and pepper chicken wings-awesome. The only really good thing we ordered.   Deep fried pork chop-it was ok. The sauce that came with was down right gross. Thank goodness it was on the side.   Shrimp won ton soup with udon-easy to explain, are ya ready? Shrimp wonton, udon, and a few greens floating in water. This soup had ZERO flavor.   Ribeye-so my hubby ordered this and I don't know why. It was excessively fatty and pretty tough. They tryed to pass off raw as medium. I work at a steak house so um when the meat is purple it's definitely not medium. So he asked for it to be cooked longer. Came back burned.

A perfect place to eat alone or with family and friends.   The menu itself is small, with new menu items displayed on the walls. I noticed that there was only one vegetable dish: Fresh Vegetables in Oyster Sauce ($3.95), but I have a feeling if you have a hankering for something non-Oystery (?!?), they will be more than happy to whip something up for you that's not on the menu.   I ordered one of the new menu items: the Fried Shrimp Wontons (10 for $4.95)- Large pieces of shrimp only lovingly wrapped in delicate wonton wrappers, and then deep fried to crunchy perfection. Served with a sweet & sour sauce. Delicious! I would order this again!  I also tried some of the Chicken Curry and Roti, which was yummy. The curry was spicy and full of hearty potatoes and quality chicken. The roti was both crispy and chewy, and was the perfect dipping tool for the curry.   The atmosphere is casual.

I didn't think I would like rice patty's with my curry but this placed changed my mind. I can't eat curry without rice patty's anymore. It's just too beautiful.

They're also known for the beef noodle soup that you can customize with types of noodles including thick white rice noodles or egg noodles.

Strongly prefer the udon noodles to the ramen noodles that are your other option. Both the WONTON SOUP and the HOUSE SEAFOOD NOODLE SOUP are good picks.  BEEF STEW is hearty and delicious, and the gravy had undertones of flavor that were reminiscent of pho. Not sure if they include bone broth in the gravy or if it's a particular aromatic, but the gravy had good flavor and the meat was tender. STEAMED CHICKEN WITH MUSHROOMS AND SAUSAGE is a solid, filling dish, served with rice and greens. Flavorful sauce is light, sausage is salty, and flavors complement one another for a balanced dish. SALT AND PEPPER WINGS are very salty and very peppery. Pretty sure this is not a dish you could order by itself, as even to eat just three of them I had to space out bites of wing with that of other dishes- if you have HBP you might want to steer clear, as the salt in this dish was quite high.

Crunchy and deep fried, it's almost impossible to screw this up. These tasted great with the sweet chili sauce.   We also requested the stir fry bok choy. This ties with the fried wontons as being my favorite item. I loved the strong garlic flavor and aroma.    Thin Rib Eye Over Rice was another dish we shared. This was pallid with dark grill marks (how does this happen?!) For a rib eye supposedly cooked at medium rare, it was surprisingly dry.  I ordered the Shrimp Wonton Soup with Noodles as my main meal. I liked the wontons, noodles, and Chinese broccoli. As for the broth, not so much; it was bland.  Lastly, service was peculiar.

However, the last time we went, it was like she did a 180 and was a totally different person. She was curt, short, awkward, and borderline rude. In fact, I totally agree with Steven P's review of how she acted.   If it wasn't for the first few times, I would probably also give a lower rating, perhaps 2 stars, based on this last interaction. But with my past experiences, and the fact that I want to give her the benefit of the doubt, I took away only one star with the intention to go back again.

We read the yelp reviews and wished we had came earler because of course, they were out of their famous Soy Sauce Chicken entree which I WILL be back for. We receieved awesome customer service from the owner/manger who helped us select lots of things off the menue. The HMO CHICKEN (I think it was called) WITH RICE was amazing mixed up with the sauces it came with. The garlic pepper chicken wings were also very very good. We had very fresh shrimp wontons and I was impressed with how fresh the shrimp tasted considering it is Las Vegas... The Ocho Vegtable dish they had went well with everything. We also had the curry and it was verrry good with some type of bread tortila to dip in it. I wasn't very fond of the pourage our friend ordered but I think it is more of a accustomed taste that is needed although my boyfriend loved it. Not only was everything great...the prices were outstanding!

This was literally the first time that I have ever eaten curry chicken without being fearful of biting into pieces of bone.  That was so awesome.  The curry was thick, and tasted hearty.  The chicken was moist and slow cooked.  The chicken wings were top notch.  They were crisp, and the seasoning was on point.  The diced jalapenos added a kick that tied all the flavors together.

They're open! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Commitment to fresh and good-quality ingredients, low-priced meals, nice plastic containers (New York style), and most dishes for only five dollars with tax included wins Big Wong's five stars.  I  first came during their dollar extravaganza days, tried their chicken roti, hoi nam chicken, beef ramen, wonton soup, and have since those days gone back about three different times. They do most things quite well, and probably do most things best in Las Vegas.  They are a café different from KJ's Kitchen, Wendy's Café and U&Me Café. Different doesn't mean better. Different just means different.   I enjoyed their salt and pepper chicken wings. I heard from the owner that his recipe is 25-30 years old. The skin is very crispy, and the chili slices add much flavor to the skin. But to be fair, how can you go wrong with chicken wings and salt and pepper?  My favorite dish is the curry chicken roti. The day that I went, they ran out of curry chicken, but they let me do the beef curry and just pay $1.50 more for extra roti. It was so delicious! The curry is not too thin or thick, just the right texture for you to dip your roti. The chicken is tender and moist, even beneath the curry.  Another notable offering they have is the fried wonton. The shrimp inside was so juicy, the skin outside was so crisp, and everything just worked so well together with the tangy sauce.   The hoi nam chicken can come on the bone or deboned with dark meat or white meat, so it's up to you to choose. We got dark meat on the bone, but have also tried boneless. It comes with no extra sauce. The rice is pretty good. I'd have to say that my favorite Hainan (Hoi Nam) chicken rice is still from Savoy in Alhambra, CA. However, in Las Vegas, this is a pretty good version. U&Me Café also has an okay version.  Definitely, when you're done with your meal, order their mango or almond jello. I have tried both. The jellos are extravagance in a cup. There's real fruit inside of the jello cup, and it looks so simple, but if you really think about it, the flavor pairings are simply culinary genius: real longan inside of almond jello. Mm... yum!  My favorite thing about Big Wong's is that the chef really prides himself in not compromising in quality for quantity. He provides both those things.   Service is great. Connie is very quick to take your order, and quick to deliver your food. I believe another waitress, Winnie, is also there and she helps to run food as well.  This place is great for large groups, couples, or for a quick solo lunch.

We were planning on Ramen Sora, but there was a wait at lunch time. I was too hungry to wait, so we decided to give the Beef Ramen at Big Wong a twirl.   We were greeted super warmly and given two big cups of steaming, delicious tea. We didn't want to go all in on the ramen, so we ordered one ramen ($5.99) and one garlic stir-fried choy sum ($4 and change).   Just to be clear: this is not beef ramen. It is really more of a beef noodle soup prepared with thin ramen-like noodles. As beef noodle soups go, it is decent for a quick, cheap fix. The flavor is pretty rich, and the beef is definitely tender and tasty. Overall, the soup is very simple: broth, beef and noodles.   The vegetables were delicious, just like I like with heaps of garlic and not too much oil. Granted, there are only 2-3 green vegetables to select from, but any green is delicious when prepared with this much garlic. When the chef brought it out, he told us next time we should order the vegetable  Thai style  because he is Thai. I didn't get the specifics, but given his warm smile and clear passion for preparing the dish, I definitely want to go back and try.  I would consider returning just for a lunch of well-prepared vegetables! I took my glass of tea with me, and as we were leaving, they were eager to top off my glass with hot tea.

Must try, their chicken wings!  OMG, the salt and pepper chicken wings are so delicious and the meat is super tender.  Got a great flavor and it's made to order.   We also got some stir fried bok choy that was really tasty and 2 of their congee.    I love the preserved egg congee and pork.  Their fish congee was just ok, the fish smelled and tasted slightly fishy....  The congee is the thick style and it's like $4 for a big bowl.    In the midst of all the pricy places to eat in Vegas, this place is a nice break on your pocketbook if you want something simple and tasty.", "Date": "2014-01-02", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "LJ", "ReviewID": "TdycACJmCRKvLB6WjnaQUQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Went there for the grand opening special. Free meal with purchase of a $1 drink. I thought it was going to be a little sampler it something but it ended up pretty good. Ordered the special fried chicken with rice 5a. The chicken was crispy and juicy, not greasy. Loved the dipping sauce that came with it. They have choice of rice or noodles for each meal. The noodles came with soup in a big bowl. They just opened so everything is clean. Service was pretty fast considering there was a bunch of meal there. I placed my order went to wash my hand in the restroom, got back all our plates were there. they did have a long line out side but its because there wasn't a waiting area inside wait, just put ur name on the list and waited 15 mins checked the other stores around so it was quick. I think today is the last day for their special so ill probably go there and try something else.

Like %85 everything on the menu was like under $5.00. This place is like a true hole in the wall restaurant. For $20 dollars, i could get a decent family style meal with some friends. My only complaint is that the curry that i order (what was advertise) was a little under seasoning. To me, it tasted a little water down. But the chicken make up for the curry sauces. I felt like he chicken was the curry it self.

The beef ramen was great; Chinese vegetables (greens) were a bit too overcooked for my personal taste; the salt and pepper shrimp came with full-size shrimp + heads (not your popcorn shrimp variety from Chinese buffets); the fried pork chops udon soup was fantastic (fried pork pieces were juicy and tender, the sauce actually had complex flavors, the udon soup was clear but flavorful. Despite being a  fried  dish, everything was light and not at all greasy).   We were disappointed that the curry dishes had been sold out that night, but overall, we were very satisfied and the meal was very kind to our wallets.

One dine in and one take out.  I think this is a family owned restaurant because when I dined it last time, the chef and waitress were yelling at each other in front of all customers.. I love their curry roti!! Its so bomb. The roti was so buttery. It already tasted good without curry sauce. The chicken chunk in the curry sauce was big but dry though. Their hainan chicken was not bad but not crazy.

Fast friendly service.  Nice and clean.  This place serves Chinese and Malaysian cuisine.  They have a simple menu with super cheap prices.  Noodle and rice with different entrees.    I tell you what I really appreciated, was the fact that the waitress was able to help me understand the menu.  Usually, when I go to an asian restaurant for the first time I am mostly confused and the waitress usually can't help you.  I was super hungry and  I asked if these were full size dishes because the prices were so cheap.  She explained everything.  She sold me on a house special.  The dish had rice, a side of something like spinach, Chinese sausage and a bowl of chicken and shitake mushrooms.  This was a house special for $5.95 and it was a hearty meal.  The chicken was silky tender in a nice broth.  The broth was a little fatty which some people may not like, but I like it.   It was real simple and homemade tasting.

Somewhat bad service!!! But great tasty food!!! That's all it matters right?!?!?  We ordered ribeye with rice, shrimp wonton soup, and chicken curry with roti pancakes. Our bill was about $17.00 this also includes our drink. So price wise is perfect, good amount of food for that price.   They have around 30 items on the menu mostly Chinese items. Ribeye was the best, the soup was good, and the curry was okay. The curry was a little disappointing for me, but hey you might like it.  The service wise was okay...The restaurant is Chinese, so you get Chinese service (where they service your order and food fast, and without a smile or anything nice).
