I'm not used to such fatty cuts of pork for adobo and I didn't like it. The fattiness overpowered the vinegary adobo sauce. I did not find the tocino sweet enough.

Location: This place is located in one of the busiest parts of China town. They're on the side of the building. Not very visible and parking is located in the back where delivery trucks roll through. Tiny restaurant with 4 tables. Mainly a delivery-type business. Very clean inside so good on them.  Price: Amazing!!!! Such great value!!!! $6.99 for all entrees.  Food: Presentation is simple, but the quality of the food is what you are craving for. Big portions, except for the rice. Which is designed to be a cup just enough to command you to order another cup.  Other Comments:  I gave a four (4) star because everything was perfect, except when I ordered a halo-halo I must constructively inform you that the halo-halo focuses more on quantity rather than quality.  Their halo-halo is cheap and big portion, except it taste like crap. Mushy unknown ingredients, and hard familiar ingredients. Very bland too, and the ice needs to be more fine. I really hope they rethink the way they make their halo-halo.  Overall: I love this place!!! I hope nothing but the best for this business and I hope they go big.

We got the pork belly sinigang and pancit bihon. The pork belly was really yummy! The sinigang broth was just perfect. It had the right amount of tamarind flavor without overpowering everything. I also enjoyed the addition of eggplant, green beans, bok choy and diced tomatoes. It's a perfect choice if you're trying to eat healthy and detox from all the carbs in Vegas.  As for the pancit bihon, I really liked it. I've had pancit bihon back in CA and sometimes it's a hit and miss. The noodles were flavorful and not dry. I liked the taste of everything.

I've had this spot in my bookmarks for the longest time, but I never really paid attention to it until I realized that it's  tapsilogan . Again, I love this kind of meal because it's hearty and it gives you a sense of home. They're very easy to make, but for a lazy gal like myself, I decided to dine out.   Again, this type of meal is a very hearty, and you can combine it with any kind of fried Filipino entree you want. When I make it on my own, I have garlic fried rice, langonisa, tocino, eggs, with sliced tomatoes on the side. Now, that's hearty. I was surprised that this spot doesn't actually have a combination. If you wanted an extra entree, you have to pay an extra $4 and something change.   I opted for the bangsilog which is milkfish and my friend got the tapsilog. For what would be a hearty meal, this was a small portion. The plating could be better, but I like the effort. There was nothing special about the flavor as it seems like they opened up a milkfish package and fried it the way it is. Fair enough, but for a restaurant, I wish that they did something more out of the box to stand out in terms of flavor.  Growing up, I've always enjoyed eating taho on summer days with my brother. It was always in the morning when the vendor would yell  taho  through the streets. It was always a delight eating those goodies so when I found out that they offered here, I had no hesitation in my head that I was going to order it. But that was quite disappointing because the syrup was close to bland, and the boba was over boiled to the point that they seem crumby on the outer layer. I did appreciate the consistency of the super soft tofu as it tasted familiar to me. Still, it was not an impressive dessert.   I also got the banana-que which seemed like it was  half-assed.  The banana wasn't thoroughly fried so it had an after taste to it. A well-executed banana-que is super soft upon bite with no hints of rawness to it. The was not the only part that was disappointing. Instead of incorporating caramelized brown sugar with it, they literally drizzled caramel sauce on it. When I saw the presentation, I was so ready to give it back to them. Instead, I opted to take it home, just to later throw it away.   The service was not good, but it wasn't bad either. The guy working the counter seemed really bored to be there. I can't blame him; it looked like a slow day for them. It just me and my friend that walked in to the shop so I assumed, an extra effort of serving us would be ideal, right? No! So we ordered our food at the counter. They cooked it so quickly, but we were surprised when the guy told us that our food was ready. He stood behind the counter expecting us to get up and pick up our plates. Uhm, excuse me?   Mind you, he was about five feet away from us, and going the extra effort to serve our dish would've been great. So we awkwardly got up to pick up our plate feeling a little lost. I'd be forgiving of the situation if the place was busy, but it was such a small venue with no one else around! He did the same thing for my desserts. The whole thing just seemed so awkward.   Also, the tv was in our direction so in the corner of my eyes, I couldn't help but feel like we were being watched. So, I wanted to eat as quickly as possible because again, it just seemed so awkward. Who's comfortable eating with the thought that someone might be eyeballing you?   I may try this out again for take out or delivery, but this experience was less than average.", "Date": "2016-06-05", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Justine", "ReviewID": "hLHs5J5EmCTF8_EZNSKKIg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Such great and authentic food that is made to order!

A pretty small venue, seats 12 people but that's fine! Good took such a short amount of time to be made, and I brought my family of 10 in here. I ordered the bangsilog and hot dang, it was fried to perfection. Achara (pickled papaya), cucumber slices and tomato slices were served with a side of garlic rice. If you're missing home, just grab your wallet and head over here! They also have kaldareta na kambing guys!", "Date": "2016-08-02", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Maria Rachelle", "ReviewID": "fhioeSL-NMKr8BtsthQd4A", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Where do I start... Food order was placed at 9:05am. Food came at 11:25am This should already give anybody an indication how well this restaurant give importance to customer service. And all they could say was sorry for the long wait. Really?! Lets move on to food... Tapa, longganisa, bangus, liempo - silog Food was very bland and obviously cold by the time we got it. Good thing we have a microwave to at least heat things up. The eggs and I mean all 10 eggs included in the orders are burnt at the bottom and very raw on top. I realize its a sunny side up but how hard can it be to not burn eggs? Once or twice may be acceptable (not!) but to burn all 5 orders of eggs (2/order) is just way too much. The liempo was made up of 2 slices of pork fat, not even a sliver of meat in it, just 2 slabs of fat cooked I don't know how.  Bangus (milkfish) that's supposed to be boneless had so much bones in it that its a joke to call it boneless.  With this kind of food, I'm surprised people are still giving it high praises. And with their kind of customer service I will caution everyone about even thinking of eating or ordering from this restaurant. There's definitely better filipino food around Vegas for anyone to waste their time here.", "Date": "2015-12-31", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Susan", "ReviewID": "grK29vr0xH9Gd4jA2-FFPg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "This place is small, but food was delicious the Sinigang bahboy was very Hot and delicious.

Don't let the space discourage you.  With only 2 tables and literally 8 chairs and a narrow 2-seater bench (the posted max room capacity is 12), it would be best if you just ordered  to go  or called in for  pick-up  , or  wouldn't mind the wait if you decided to eat in.  In a weird kinda way, it reminded me of my grandma's  dirty kitchen  back in Hawaii (FYI:  Dirty kitchen does not mean the kitchen is dirty.  For Pinoys, it's the  other fully functional kitchen  where most of the cooking and dining are done while the main kitchen and main dining room are kept immaculately clean and hardly touched except on very few special occasions).    There is a reasonable wait because your food is cooked  a la minute .  Mind you, its not the best but their offerings definitely hit the spot.  I didn't even know they existed until after reading an email I received from Eater featuring Vegas cheap eats.    Silogs are typically a breakfast fare ( almusal  in the native vernacular, derived loosely from Spanish verb  almozar ) but are offered here all day long with 16 varieties to choose from.  I walked in just as they were opening up for the day so I was the only customer. I briefly chatted with the chef and he looked vaguely familiar.  It turns out, this place is  owned/managed by the same people behind Full House BBQ in Henderson.   After the chef started preparing my food, people started coming in and all were ordering silogs.   I planned all along to order a silog but ended up ordering regular lunch dish (pancit canton, lumpia shanghai and tokwa't baboy) since it was lunch time.  Don't get me wrong, my lunch was neither too bad nor the best but let's just say I should have stuck with my guns and ordered a silog.     I am definitely going back and try their silogs and update my review (by the way, my 4 star rating is for the non-silog lunch I had).", "Date": "2015-07-16", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
