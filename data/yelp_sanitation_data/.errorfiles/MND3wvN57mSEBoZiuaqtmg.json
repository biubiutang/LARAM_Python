I wanted a quick car wash as I had my 1 year old daughter with me, the guy at the beginning of car wash pressured me into a full detail because of the deals. I told him I didn't care about what was included in the cost and I just wanted a  quick  clean because I didn't have time to spend because of my baby. He said he was a dad, he understood, he would rush my car and it would be done in half an hour - 45 minutes tops. So I spend $60 and one hour and 45 minutes later with a cranky, hungry toddler in tow my car is  done . I just wanted to get out of there and with the amount of time I spent I figured they cleaned it very well. Well now I'm home and those kids that do car washes for fundraising could have done a better job for $5. The bottom of my car is still muddy, they did not even touch my gear shift where there is still dirt and my dash is dusty! My rear window has a hand smudge mark and I swear there's a new ding on my passenger side door. If you guys think they do a good job you've obviously never had your car done anywhere else. I will never go back here again and will drive an extra 20 minutes to Oasis at the Shell on Pecos and Flamingo.

Their classic wash will cost you $14.99 and it is exterior wash only. You throw in another $5 for a glorified exterior wash (tire dressing added!) which is called ultra! I had some stains inside the doors and asked them to clean, learning that I would have to upgrade to the Hand-wash (VIC)! And that would cost me $49.99. The supreme wash which is only $27.99 cannot buy you wiping the plastic parts with wet towel. I had an argument with the field supervisor back and forth and couldn't wrap my brain around why they wouldn't just wipe the door interrupts! The guy basically told me that his guys were trained to just lightly dust the plastic parts and dash for even $27.99 and I would have to pay $50 for that service. I am actually impressed how blunt they are about the scam; it takes guts to openly tell people that you will be ripping them for something so basic. Anyways, I deserve this because I am so lazy!

Waiting area was filthy, but someone did come clean it while I was sitting there. I was in and out in about 45 minutes which wasn't bad, but the wax was a waste of money. I have to agree with recent reviewers that this place has gone downhill. They were better off when they had a large Hispanic workforce and now it's a bunch of lazy, white teenagers. I was irritated just watching these lethargic chubsters slowly meander around my truck.  I said to the kid that I didn't notice any difference with or without the wax. He just laughed and said nothing. I walked around and then handed him a $5, which I always do. He took it, said nothing, and walked off. They got wax on my windows and missed a lot on the interior. I opened my passenger door and still had mud right there on the step where you get in. Come on guys! With the  wax , it ran almost $35, plus $5 tip.

I figured I would try this place out and it was truly a big mistake. They did vacuum the car thoroughly, there is still stains and gunks that have not been wiped. I usually wouldn't mind a little here and there, but this place just did nothing. There is still dust inside my car...It seems like they just wipe it down a little bit with a dry rag and say they r done because i only waited about 15 minutes for my car to be finished. No good customer service as well. There is one young hispanic girl who works as a cashier that never smiles, says hello, or ask what u would like. One time I went in and saw her. She never aaid hi and just looked at me. I looked at her and waited for her say something, but nope. She was the first reason why I didnt like going to this place, but now I definitely have another reason why I should not go here....If I could give a zero, I would. Please do not go here for a car wash. It is not worth your money and time. If u r paying with ur own money, u deserve more than just a stare and horrible customer service..", "Date": "2016-02-18", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Franz", "ReviewID": "hmoYkrT_QV7x34H1d59GNw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Amazing detail service for $24, good gas price, clean facilities and excellent customer service!", "Date": "2011-05-08", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jim", "ReviewID": "QjBQcEe97_KuSeTHMGgW8w", "Overall": "5", "Content": "The guys at the car wash work so hard and do such a great job I end up over-tipping each time I get my car washed.

I've tried this place three times with no luck and only a dirty car and frustration to show for it. The first time I went I expected for them to actually clean the inside. After 45 minutes of waiting, I get the car back and to my surprise the cup holders are dirty. The gearshift, the doors, the back windshield, and my rearview  mirrors were untouched and dirty. I asked the attendant if there's a reason that these things weren't done. He looks at me confused and says I don't know what you mean. I was in a rush so I just left. I called to ask how I could  my money back after spending over $20 for a car wash and my car was still dirty. The staff told me that they could not refund my money but I could take my car back and they would fix it. I took the car back  a second time and it still looked the same as the first time. Weeks ago I was in a pinch and since it's a block away from my house I figured I'd give them a try again. Big mistake!!! They didn't clean the cup holders they didn't clean the back windshield they didn't clean the gear shift they did not dust off the controls, etc. Another $20 wasted. If you want a good car wash go to Country Club on Eastern and Serene...

The girls at the counter are usually pretty pleasant.  They issued me a punch card so after my 10 visits, I get one free!  Love it!   I was never really sure of the proper procedure but I would go in to pay first.  Then I just drive my car to the 'starting line'.  The gentlemen usually working there are very gracious and quick about coming over to greet me.  From there it's about a 5-10 minute wait for completion.  There are plenty of seats to wait either inside or out to watch the finishing touches.  After it goes through the wash, they thoroughly dry it off and dust the entire inside.  Every time my car is perfect again with not a speck of dirt or water spot.  They have done an amazing job with every visit and I am a happy girl.

No, but for the price and convenience it is well worth it. This location is one block from my apartment so it makes life less difficult.   The highest tier for EXTERIOR ONLY wash cost me $11. I also opted $15 for an exterior hand waxing/buffing.   My car needed a wash badly. I had just driven from San Francisco area to Las Vegas, then Las Vegas to SoCal, then SoCal to Las Vegas. My car looked like it had just been through Operation Desert Storm. In addition, my car looked like a mass grave for bugs and it had been caked on by the unforgiving Las Vegas heat.   I didn't expect much from this wash because lets face it... its a gas station car wash. After going through the machine car wash, a team of workers went to town on my car. They wiped down every nook and cranny of my car. I saw one of the techs really working hard to get all the caked on brake dust off my wheels. Then one of the guys went at it with a buffing machine and some wax. They waxed the roof and wiped down some of the interior panels... even though I only paid for an exterior wash.   When I got the car back it was squeaky clean. It had a mirror like finish and the paint felt smooooth. I will definitely come back again whenever I need a wash.", "Date": "2016-07-08", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Chuck", "ReviewID": "nCl2Rn5wa8b4GaQiVAlR0w", "Overall": "2", "Content": "This was my first experience at the Pit Stop. I needed to get the wifes car a nice scrub down after leaving the gym and they were conveniently located right there.The wash will run you right around 20 bucks for something decent, that includes a free air freshner (alright pina colada). They TAKE THEIR TIME washing your ride here which can either be a good or a bad thing. That depends on your schedule.  The waiting area has 2 large flat screen tv's. They were rocking the food network and a camera showing your car going through the wash process.  The wash was pretty good but for me it wasnt worth the wait. By the time i got my car back i had bee there for over an hour. Im not sure if thats a normal ordeal for them or what. But ill stick to my normal places and will probably never drive back to the PIT STOP unless i have time to spare.

She just told the supervisor to tell me that they're not  responsible for belongings inside the car  even though I had JUST disconnected it for them to clean the inside of my car. Nobody seems to have it of course, so even though it's a minor thing, I called the local police to see if we can find the person responsible for that. HORRIBLE customer service.
