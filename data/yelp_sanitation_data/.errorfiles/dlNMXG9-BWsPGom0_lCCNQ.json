I'm a big fan of Peru Chicken and their aaamazing food!  After a couple visits, I have some favorite orders: The Pollo con Arroz y Frijoles (Whole rotisserie chicken with rice and beans) and Arroz Chaufa (Fried Rice). The chicken is amazing and don't miss out on their housemade sauces! The yellow and green sauces have kick, so watch out! Six days a week, you'll get long-grain white rice, but on Saturdays, you get Arroz Verde (sometimes you have to ask for it, but make sure you do!) and you really, really want the Green Rice. It's so darn good that you'll be rather disappointed on the other days of the week. I looove the Fried Rice with beef. It's so, so flavorful. I almost always get an order of the Papas Fritas (Fries) as well because, well, FRIES.  I'm usually too full to get to dessert, but this time, I made sure to save some room. So, I finally tried the Picarones ($5.50), donuts made with pumpkin and sweet potato. It's served with Chancaca, a syrup made with panela, an unrefined cane sugar, plus orange peel, cloves, and star anise. Delicious and savory!  This location has less seating than the Sahara store, but otherwise, everything seems the same.

I'm excited to see picarones on the menu, so I will be back to try those sweet potato and pumpkin fritters soaked in brown sugar syrup very soon.   Petra and I tested out her favorite dish, papa a la Huancaína. They provided so much of the tasty, mildly spiced cheese sauce that we were soaking it up with lettuce leaves after the warm potato slices were gone. A cup of chicha morada, a drink of boiled purple corn, fruits, and spices served cold was good, though it had less clove flavor than I'm used to.   Pollo a la brasa is their specialty, so I took a half chicken to my husband for his lunch at work. It cost $9 and included two sides. I got rice and fries for him; beans and salad are also available if you're the Anticarb. It appeared to be a smaller bird, but the skin had an aromatic blend of seasonings and perfect caramelization. He enjoyed the flavor, especially with the mustardy yellow sauce. A spicy green ají sauce was also included.  Lunch specials are offered Monday through Friday from 11am to 3pm, and breakfast on the weekends features traditional dishes like tamales. Order your meal and pay at the counter. There are a few tables for dining in, and I saw many people picking up large takeout orders.

Located in the same strip mall as Cuba Cafe on Tropicana. This family run business is a hole in the wall, but that's where you find some of the most tastiest bites around!  We entered the restaurant and the dining area was packed with people gettin' their FIFA on (12-15 people...I think about 16-18 people is the maximum capacity)The tables and counter area was full except for one spot.....a two top in the HALLWAY  on the way to the restrooms. At this point, we didn't care and we were hungry so we ordered up right away. We started off with a Chicken Tamale, and Wifey's favorite Papa A la Huancaina. The gentlemen brings a bottle of green sauce to our table, and I squirt it on to my first bite of the tamale, and in the process, scorch a few of my tastebuds only to find out that it was the more fiery Salsa de Huacatay. Luckly I was able to extinguish the inferno in my mouth with some tasty Inca Kola. The tamale was a bit on the dry side and stingy on the chicken, the papas were the better of the two apps with all that cheesy goodness.  It was also National Ceviche Day as Amanda M. had mentioned,(What a co-inky- dink!) and that is another dish I haven't had in a while, so we had planned on getting an order of the Ceviche de Pescado and their speciality, a 1/4 chicken with rice. The Ceviche is presented with a very generous portion of marinated sea bass(not sure if the fish selection changes), red onion, sweet potato, hominy(I think),  toasted corn, and lots of leche de tigre(the liquid that comes from marinating the fish with the lime juice) great flavors and textures in this dish.(Definitely making this one at home too!) The chicken arrived with a side of beans and Jasmine rice which was pretty dry, but that chicken was juicy and delicious. That Aji Verde though...I almost killed the entire bottle! Can't wait to get all the ingredients so I can have my own supply at home. I'd definitely return for the chicken, and hopefully save room for some of the desserts.  ALOHA!!!

Picarones are pumpkin and sweet potato doughnuts served with drizzled chancaca, a South American sweet sauce made with raw sugar and honey.  The picarones had been drizzled with the chancaca and there was much left at the bottom to dip the remaining pieces.  Service was very pleasant.

I caught a quick glance of Peru Chicken out of the corner of my eye while driving in this part of town and decided to bookmark it for later. I'm actually glad that I did because this place really did not disappoint!  The interior is pretty small. It has a few seats for eating in, but can get a little crazy when the store is full.    One of the entrees I ordered was the tallarin verde con bistec (which I pretty much butchered when I was saying it for my order LOL) which consisted of the green pesto noodles, slices of steak, and a mini potato spud.    The steak was so soft and melt-in-your-mouth. I was pretty satisfied that these tender bits of meat were packed with savory flavor. They're cooked to perfection and will leave your tastebuds wanting more.    The potato was small but it's a much needed, hearty carbohydrate that complimented the dish well. It was very soft, which is the perfect consistency to enjoy with the steak slices.  The tallarin noodles were pretty bomb, too! I didn't know that pesto pasta would be the perfect match with steak and potatoes! Green is my favorite color, so naturally I had to give this dish a try... The noodles were cooked perfectly. They were firm, but not undercooked and hard.  I also had the 1/4 chicken and their rice. The chicken was pretty amazing. It's cooked rotisserie style, so the flavors are all there. It wasn't dry on the inside, either. It was juicy and tender throughout the whole piece I was given. The rice (I'm guessing it's basmati rice since the grains were long and slender) wasn't mushy and wet, it was firm and very flavorful. I feel like you could eat this rice by itself because it's that good.  Don't be shy on the sauces! The lighter green of the two is creamy and will pair perfectly with pretty much anything you order (but goes best with the chicken, obviously). If you prefer a spicy kick to your food, go for the darker green sauce.  Inca Kola is sold here and it's the perfect beverage to have when eating this kind of chicken and sides (like plantains and yucca). It's basically liquid candy gold because it tastes like bubblegum and has a pretty color to it!  It's worth the trip here and I will definitely be a repeat customer for sure.", "Date": "2015-08-22", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "James", "ReviewID": "Q6U_qlsFrOoW4CaJ-p56Cw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "My Peruvian wife was very impressed.

This place seemed to receive the highest views so I wanted to give it a shot.   I went with the 1/4 chicken white, white rice and beans, plantains, and picarones for dessert.   The chicken was good, not great. Tasty but not overly moist like I hoped for but had a nice dry rub that gave it good flavor. The rice was pretty dry. The beans were really good. In a tomato based paste vs. just being beans in a cup. The plantains were really nicely done as I expected them to be at a Peruvian place.   The picarones were tasty. I saw the photo and knew I had to give them a try. They are basically sweet potato and dough, donut rings with a honey sauce drizzled on top.   For all those things, I paid about $17 with tip. Wasn't cheap but not really expensive either.   The service was 'ok'. I would say really good but the lady never thanked me for coming in. I always like to hear that. I walked out of the door slowly just to see if she would say something then- but nothing. It's a small place so she definitely saw me.
