I'm a fan!!!!!!!!!!  I actually host my first UYE (pre UNLV game) on 2/20/13 here and sooooo glad I did!   We had a party of 9 or 10 and the service was fast and the young lady was super sweet!  I started off by ordering the table several orders of edamame and kimchi.  The edamame was piping hot and salted. I'm really glad I ordered both because for some reason this is my new fav kimchi! I must go back and buy a whole bunch!   VEGETARIANS BEWARE! They do not have any veggie options. :)  I'm not strict so I chose to get the Tori Ramen (chicken broth) with no egg and no chicken. WOW! It was really good! The broth was perfect not too oily and not too salty. I really liked the noodles how they were thin and a little firm. I ordered add seaweed to mine but I think she/they forgot to add it oh well :) They are famous for their pork based broth but I strictly do not eat pork so that was totally out.   All and all it was a super great spot and a super great UYE of sweet new Yelp friends.

I know edamame seems like it's all created equal, but their soybeans are plump and wonderful. They use a great flaky salt on them, too.  Spicy ramen was amazing. Pork was incredibly tender, and the broth was flavorful and complex! It's good with kimchi in it, too, if you're into that. I am.  The chicken ramen is great. More basic than the spicy ramen, so if you're looking for a flavor experience, go for the spicy. It's not super spicy (at least to me).

I just don't have the tongue for it. My wife, who's Japanese, loves it. However their tori (chicken) ramen is just perfect for me. My tip is to order it with extra chicken.  Their appetizers are fantastic and presented well. Their new agedashi tofu dish is probably my favorite in the valley and the gyoza is exactly how you expected it. However their karaage can be a bit on the greasy side.

I heard ALL the buzz about the major players and decided I finally needed to give them all a whirl for my own Battle Ramen.  Fukumimi was my second stop of the three. My fianc√© (who is a HUGE fan of ramen!) and I came for dinner and had amazing timing - no wait and we got a table next to the window. I ordered the Tantan Men (Szechwan style spicy W soup of pork and chicken, with sesame sauce and red chili oil, topped with seasoned ground meat and bok choy) and Ruben ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen. We also ordered a side of Curry Rice (small) and Gyoza.  Our verdicts? Meh. Everything was good, but not as good as other ramens we enjoyed in town. I like the Tantan Men's unique flavor and depth, but I didn't love it over other Tonkotsu and Miso broths I've had. It was also the first time I couldn't finish my bowl. Ruben preferred the noodles and broth of other ramen shops. He also didn't think it was spicy enough (the guy has a stomach of steel). The curry was good; reminded me of the Japanese curry I ate back home (Hawaii). The gyoza was tasty too and I loved their dipping sauce.  For both of us, this is our last choice compared to Monta and Sora. We also determined that it was definitely a preference, not the quality or taste of the individual ramen shops. Even both of us like different ramen. What we could agree on was that we didn't like the noodles here (I like the thicker, wavy noodles with more bite).", "Date": "2013-09-24", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Wendy", "ReviewID": "e_aVWKXdqdet30pkkzO_jg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "The best ramen in town!!!

I went with the chicken ramen because pork ramen didn't sound appetizing to me. I forgot what my boyfriend ordered but it had seaweed.

Uncomfortable wooden chairs. - Luke warm broth, but hot noodles. Sections of the soup had different temperature!? HAHA.  - Small portion relative to price.  - Great flavor. Savory, pork-esque, slightly creamy.  - Half an egg only. Just order extra for a full egg.  - $1 for a full egg. 50cents for canned corn.  - Null service. Nothing to really discuss. Here is your drink, soup, and check.  - A bit too much fat on the pork belly for my liking.  - I recommend the fukumimi ramen. Not too thick, rich flavor and taste over Tan tan. - Tan tan had minced pork. Cheap. Broth was creamy and noodles were different compared to fukumimi. - Stamp card!

It small pieces of fried chicken goodies. The batter not too heavy or too light. Chicken nice hot and moist on the inside. Also ordered some kim chee was really good! It had just the right amount of kick too it!   I ordered the Fukumimi Ramen. The broth was amazing! The noodles thiner and added different texture/taste too my ramen.

In the end the closest too the time always ends up on top and one not have too wait very long another leg up.   Fukumimi okay size probably about the same size as Ramen Sora. They do have sitting area that can watch them make Ramen. Parking is not problem here because part of a decent little shopping mall. The whole staff did wonderful job of handling big party 12 yelpers in all. They kind enough too do separate checks for everyone.

Food: Kara-age (Japanese Fried Chicken): 5/5 Very delicious, it comes with a side of mixed greens with house dressing and grey salt.

Fukumimi Miso Ramen: 4/5 LOVED the broth, it was very smooth and flavorful without the super saltiness of Monta (although I still love Monta). If you know me or have read my reviews you know I LIKE IT SPICY. So I drown my soup with sesame oil and Japanese chilli power Togarashi. Their Tamago (egg) was delicious! I just wished they soaked it in the marinade a bit longer, it looked very light but still delicious. The soft boil was perfect and yolky. Their Cashu pork was equally delicious and soft, I just wish they gave you more than just 1 slice but not too much, I felt if I order the extra (3+slices) it would've been too over the top.   Service: 4/5 It was surprisingly empty when I went around 5pm on a Saturday, but the staff was still very nice and attentive and up beat even if they were slow. Our waitress was very nice and explain our questions very well. Except my table didn't get any straws for our waters and my friend said other tables were given straws.

My check in to Ramen Sora resulted to a ton of advice coming from other Yelp peeps from Las Vegas to SoCal. Either I have lots of love coming from my Yelp homies or they knew I was a newbie to this phenomenon called Ramen.  One common advice, if I like Ramen Sora, I will love Fukumimi. I knew that this visit was coming soon and when Elizabeth B set up the UYE, I could not resist.    Somewhat armed with knowledge, one thing that I knew coming in was the noodle type that each place proposes.  The Tantan Men was highly suggested, but there was too much in it that I was not allowed to eat until after Easter. So, kept this place bookmarked just for their Tantan Men. I opted for Fukumimi's Tonkotsu Miso Ramen minus the meat, added 2 extra eggs, and 3 extra seaweeds. When it comes to taste, I admit the broth was perfect and creamy.  You also know it's creamy when you cannot see anything deep inside your bowl. So good that I didn't finish my bowl.  As a special touch I added the Karaage to my order, which is basically small fried chicken pieces.  But there's nothing basic about their Karaage. The Karaage is a tastier and super tender boneless chicken that's also lightly breaded.  This complimented the ramen to perfection.    As for who's got it better than them? Well, depends on the person. I prefer the taste of Fukumimi, but the noodles of Ramen Sora. In other words, I'm torn but do not mind taste testing both and having a personal challenge for the rest of my life.  Couple of UYE call outs.  First time to hang out at a UYE with Elizabeth B, Ian A, Shirley B, and Joe L.  It's been a pleasure and great minds do think alike.  Another UYE with Terri R, Alicia R, Francisco A, and Chad S in a week's time.  This is becoming habit, this is becoming family. Thanks Elizabeth B. for setting this up. You're the best!!  PS: Ate  Food for You  aka Shirley B taught me a chopstick trick when eating ramen. That is to keep the chopsticks intact and use it like a fork and twirl the noodles together. Sort of like how you use a fork to eat spaghetti.

When I heard of a new ramen place opening closer to Henderson, I had to try it. Sadly, though, it just didn't hit the spot.  I came here on a Sunday night and it wasn't too busy, I'd say half filled. There are probably around 20 or so seats, so not a terribly large place but it is cozy. They were quick to seat us, but they were a bit slow to take our order. We started with the Karaage then I ordered the Tan Tan Men and my boyfriend had their Tonkotsu Salt Ramen. The wait for the food wasn't too long, and we were sitting at the bar so it was fun watching them prepare the food.  Karaage - I thought this was the best part of the meal. It was lightly breaded and nicely fried without being too oily. The chicken was still moist and very flavorful. It came with some salt on the side in case you wanted that extra sodium. There was also a little side salad with a tasty dressing, my guess is ginger miso.   Tan Tan Men - I was pretty disappointed with this. The initial bite was good, but as I continued to eat it, I liked it less and less. The broth was too creamy and thick, and when I'm at a ramen place, I love to drink the soup. But this is not a soup to just sip on with the noodles, it's more of a thin gravy. Also, the flavor just seemed off, similar that musty flavor of bamboo shoots? I just wasn't a fan of it.  Tonkotsu Salt Ramen - It comes with black garlic oil, but I think it could have used a little more. The broth was decent, it had a fairly well developed flavor. I just didn't like that it was so fatty. I know Tonkotsu has lots of pork fat in it, but this one just seemed to have a thick layer of oil on top of the soup. I could just feel it coating my intestines. Another thing is that they're a little stingy with the meat, there was only one piece of char siu. I will say that I liked the egg though. It was perfectly runny, but it was only room temperature at best.   Overall, the ramen was decent, but I would not get the Tan Tan Men.

(in mini-mall Tokyo)  No this one is on East side by UNLV, where most of the students hang out. In any case, it just opened and once in a while, it's good to break away from the usual haunts (I still love you the best, Monta, but I wanna see what the others have to offer). Monogamy has no place in the F&B world when it comes to this glutton.  Fukumimi means 'Lucky Ear', and when I arrived at an off peak time period, the place was crawling with Japanese people (first good sign).  And the interior had a cheery and warm environment (aka, it actually looked like someone put some thought into it's design...I appreciate that)....good sign #2  I love it when the weather gets cold here, it's the perfect time for a piping hot bowl full of Ramen.  And on a particularly cold day like Saturday, I was running from my car to get into the steam filled restaurant to warm up!  Inside, it's a bright atmosphere with that new restaurant feel (kinda like a new car...didn't want to use the smell reference...)  I was seated at the counter, where I could see all the action.  The owner was working the line, (the Ramen component) while another gentleman worked the fryer, both working furiously to dish out orders.  I parked my seat down a bar stool, hoping to get warm when I realized it was much colder at the counter; they had air vents blowing cold air to counteract all the steam emanating from the open kitchen (I was freezing by the time I left...must remember that I can eat here in the Summer...and not sit at the counter!!!)  So Fukumimi's specialty is Tonkotsu Ramen, a pork bone broth that make the broth thick with a milky consistency that is very filling.  It's accompanied with slices of Pork Belly, Boiled Egg, Bean Sprouts, Corn and Scallions...and Noodles of course....  There are other things on the menu, Chicken Ramen, a cold Tomato Ramen and Tan Tan Men (a spicy Sichuan dish);  as well, there are various Rice Bowls that looked pretty good too.  On the Appetizer list: the Chicken Karage was recommended,  (and at $3.99 for six pieces, it's a bargain) and it came out piping hot.  I loved the crispness of fried skin, followed by a moist bite of juicy chicken flesh that sears the roof of your mouth, as steam billows through the tears-heaven...  Thoroughly enjoyable and worth coming for-a must get item!  And when the boiling, hot cauldron of noodle soup arrived in front of my icicle hanging nose,    I enveloped my face into it's hot breath, inhaling the fatty oils feeding my fifth sense.  I ordered the Miso Tonkotsu, a blend I find most palatable.  My first visual: long, thick slices of Pork Belly cut in the most unusual way to which, I have not seen before in Ramen (not that I'm complaining, I ordered extra Chasu Pork and I practically got the whole bowl full of it - score!!!)  As for the Broth, (the most important component of Ramen in my humble opinion) it was smooth, lighter than I thought, it didn't have that unctuous, almost greasy quality that I anticipate/hope for, then somewhat regret after eating like buyer's remorse.  In this case, I could finish the soup sans regret.  Now with another Ramen Restaurant in the Vegas fold, it's getting very interesting; people will decide their favorites, alliances will be formed, friends will become enemies, families will be torn blah blah blah....  I'm just glad that there's more choices, I already have my favorite list, but that's for another post!

I shouldn't be that surprised since I know that people will wait for good ramen all the time everywhere, but as funny as this may sound, my time seems more precious to me while I'm on vacation and I sure don't want to spend it waiting for a bowl of noodles.  Fortunately due to the diligence of a couple of Yelp friends, they've trail blazed their way to Fukumimi's, a modest unassuming place East of the strip where you can get a good bowl of ramen without a crazy line to get in like the one we encountered at Monta's...  Two of our favs for apps happen to be Agedashi Tofu http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukumimi-ramen-las-vegas?select=F-LSBeG2Chhi6ZNlx2o2nQ#uH7PEnc0RPMmmJ4mSKvzJA and Karaage http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukumimi-ramen-las-vegas?select=F-LSBeG2Chhi6ZNlx2o2nQ#F-LSBeG2Chhi6ZNlx2o2nQ;  both of these were nicely done.  The tofu was silky soft with a gentle crispy cover, slightly mitigated by the sweet mirin.  The presentation was superb as each block was topped with negi on one, hairlike strands of nori on the other, and bookended by a single baby bok choy.  The chicken was nice and juicy with a seasoned crust, accompanied by a citrusy green salad on the side to cut through some of the saltiness...  We both got Tonkotsu Ramen, the one that favored salt has flavored garlic oil http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukumimi-ramen-las-vegas?select=F-LSBeG2Chhi6ZNlx2o2nQ#HFqyXLlE-6uJ134LGBgxzg, and one that favored soy has a single sheet of nori http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukumimi-ramen-las-vegas?select=F-LSBeG2Chhi6ZNlx2o2nQ#0oIEfHKL4HBSBS4pUC5WOQ.  Both come with chasiu, half a seasoned soft egg, sprouts, and more chopped negi.  Not the richest kottari pork broth that I have found, but despite it's thinner consistency it was still a tasty soup that  managed to really hit the spot without inducing an impending after lunch drowsiness.  The egg was beyond runny but still on the soft side.  The chasiu with its familiar outer  ring was sliced thin, slightly collapsing when tugged at by chopsticks...  Service was cheerful and polite, in that Japanese schoolgirl way, but short of obnoxiously annoying like you feel when being patronized. The best thing about everything was the casual speakeasy feeling about being able to sit down immediately when you walk in and getting service right away without any hovering or rush.

I'm not here to tell you that Fukumimi is better or worse than the next ramen spot.  I'm here to tell you that I had quite a pleasant experience here, and I would recommend you to come check it out.  A lot of people recommend the tan tan men ramen, but spicy soups are not my style.  I went for the tonkotsu with soy I believe.  There is no menu online for me to confirm the exact name, but I got the soy based one as opposed to miso or salt or a spicier variation.  Chashu, green onion, and corn.  That is all I need.  I didn't feel like it was overly salty like some have mentioned.  I recommend the soy broth if you don't want to be so mainstream, delicious and simple, and more natural it seemed, as opposed to other flavorings.  The karaage is also a perfect appetizer.  It's like getting raisin canes from Japan!! (joke, although I am very fond of the Canes chain).  This restaurant will be successful.  The staff are very sweet and accommodating as well.  We were sitting next to another couple, and our server asked us if we wanted to move our table a little farther so we could have more privacy.

Me and my friend both ordered Ramen with a side dish, I got chicken ramen with kimchi on the side, he got porkbelly ramen with dumplings, they have specific names I just don't recall them haha. Anyways, the service was very quick for being so busy, we got all of our orders including the ramen in what must've been no longer than 5 minutes.   The ramen came in this giant and traditional looking bowl, steaming at the top. First of all, the noodles were something else. They were the perfect consistency, not falling apart to the touch, but not hard enough to choke on. I could tell they were homemade, which is a big plus for me. The broth was bursting with flavor, and of course the chicken, egg and bean sprouts all made the meal feel authentic and delicious. The dumplings were perfectly seared on one side, and soft on the other with well seasoned meat inside. The kimchi was no push over either, spicy and zingy without being over powering.  And overall the prices were very good.

You see a friends check in, and then you decide that's what you want to eat for dinner, and then find a new place near you. That's how my discovery of Fukumimi Ramen came about.   I walked in the door at 6:30pm and the place was packed. Maybe 12 people huddled inside waiting for tables. You walk to the counter and put your name on a list, circling yes or no for counter or table. Being a single, I opted for counter and still that took about 20 minutes to get a seat. I almost walked away to my second choice when I first opened the door, glad I decided to wait.   I had the standard Tokonsu Miso Ramen. Includes a slice of pork belly (recommend adding another), egg, corn. I found the broth to be very good, not salty like Ramen Sora. A nice balance of flavor between the corn and a few light chili flakes didn't make it overly sweet or overly spicy. For me it was perfect, I could taste the chili but it didn't make me walk away as I've been known to do with spicy foods.   I liked it better than Ramen Sora, and better than Monta (who I really like). The building is small, maybe table room for 16 and counter space for 6.

The karaage chicken is boneless and not the chicken wings like other places try to pass off as karaage. The chicken is lightly coated, crispy on the outside, while the meat is juicy and tender. Paired with the mixed greens tossed in a miso dressing, it was perfect.  I had ordered the tan tan men; a spicy broth mixed with ground chicken and pork. This preparation comes from Chinese influence and incorporates bok choy in it. I thought that it was the perfect balance of richness, a touch of sweetness, and saltiness. I finished mine in no time and started to eat my friend's salt miso when she couldn't finish it. Yet again, I liked the balance in the broth. The color was opaque and it tasted as if bones and meat had been simmering in it for hours.   The best part was that I still felt full around dinner time.

Seem like a typical ramen-ya.   Typical japanese greeting upon entrance, seated quickly. Came to the restaurant on a Wednesday evening around 530ish. There was maybe 2 other parties there aside from us. If my memory serves me correctly, this used to be a different japanese restaurant that was based on sushi before.   The restaurant is a brightly lit restaurant with a row of bar seats facing the kitchen, and a row of tables with chairs on one side and a long extending wood bench on the opposite side.   Service, the waitress was nice to get our waters. But seemed to like hover around waiting for us to order (which was a little weird).   They had two soup broths (mainly pork [tonkotsu]) but they had a chicken [tori] option. The tonkotsu based ramen's consisted on a salt, soy, miso, spicy, and their special Fukumimi ramen. Each their own style. I believe they all use the same type of ramen noodles (thin straight noodles, very similar to the ones at Monta). Prices are fairly average ranging from $7.50 for the salt and soy tonkotsu, $8.20 for the miso or spicy option, or $9.50 for their special fukumimi ramen that i believe has extra meat. The chicken ramen is similar to the salt tonkotsu ramen except its a  creamy rich chicken soup base  and also had the garlic oil. There is options for extra toppings at additional cost. Didnt see an option for extra noodles though. They also had two other ramens, one was tantan men and the other was tomato ramen (cold). uhh if i remember correctly, tantan men is not a ramen, also in fact, its a dry noodle. Very interesting.   My friend and I had ordered salt (me) and soy (her). Another party had seated next to us. Apparently the waitress got confused on the orders and asked our table what we had gotten and see if it matched the order she had (but found out was the other table). When the food had come, she went to their table and asked them before figuring out it was for our table. Uh.. Lol.. i thought she had that figured out? guess not.  Now for the food. Soup base was ok. Can't figure out if i like it or not. Initially when the ramen had came, i had tried both soup bases from mine and my friends. one salt base, one soy based.. One was saltier than the other but me and my friend had opposing opinions. Both our ramens had one slice of pork, 1/2 a soft boiled egg, some pickled ginger, onions, and bean sprouts.. The thing that was different was mine had this black garlic oil vs hers had a piece of nori.   Honestly, i couldnt taste the  original fragrant garlic oil  it mentions. yah i see it but i dont think its as fragrant as it may seem to be. Another thing we had noticed was all the tables, except the bar, did not have any seasoning items. Not even the basic ones you see like chili pepper or chili oil.. or sesame seeds.. Was kind of surprised.   The pork was more lean in comparison to what you get at Monta. Wished they had left the pickled ginger as a side u can put yourself instead of it being in the bowl already.

As my roommate has promoted to me, we decided to take a quick drive over.  I had their tonkotsu spicy and I requested the broth to be extra hot.  It came out so nice.  With a cold coming, my throat felt so good.  Their noodles were excellent and it was crunchy to me.  The sliced pork was very well portion and tender.  Soup was not too spicy.  Since my gf was afraid of spice, she went with the tonkotsu soy.  Judging by the fact that the bowl was empty.  It must have been solid for her.   Service was above and beyond.  Because of my request for extra hot broth, they were a little confused.  They made an effort to have another person ask me what I asked to clear up the haze.

We make it at home and we always order it when we go to Ichiza in Chinatown.  We currently moved to trop and pecos and we would drive by this place Fukumimi Ramen a lot and always wanted to try it.  So tonight we finally did.    It's not a very big place.  I'd say it seats about 20-30 people.  One thing to note is that though the hours of operation are listed as they're open until 11pm, they take their last order at 10:30.  We arrived at about 10:15pm and the waitress turned the open sign off promptly at 10:30.    We ordered the karaage and the gyoza first.  Karaage is Japanese fried chicken.  Gyoza is a dumpling/potsticker.  Both were really good.  I thought the chicken was perfectly cooked.  The potstickers come with a special gyoza sauce which was a yummy combo.  For the ramen we ordered the fukumimi ramen, they're specialty.  There are about ten other ramen dishes to choose from.  The fukumimi ramen comes with pork belly in it.  Sooo good.  My boyfriend and I split a bowl of that.  In total our bill came to $22 plus tip.    My only problem is that I left feeling slightly hungry still.

It's a new place that just recently opened up. Wouldn't have found out if a friend didn't tell me.   So far I would have to say I like it a bit better than Monta, but not by much. I grew up in Japan and ramen there has never made me nauseous or throw up until I've came here and tried Monta's.   The service is typical, with a greeting at the door and a waitress came and seated myself and a friend. There weren't that many people there, actually only one party of two on the other side of the restaurant, when we went in. Thought they seemed to be a bit confused with which table ordered what at first, but that was sorted out quickly.   It was a cute place, with the kitchen being maybe a third of the restaurant which is a open bar style, with a bar seating area right in front of it. There were tables and a bench seating area to the right upon entering. The bench seats also double up as storage, my friend pointed out that they look like they moved and so I got curious and got up and wanted to see if they could. =]   So we got the Tonkotsu ramen (pork based broth), my friend got the salt and I got the soy, both priced at about $7.50 which wasn't too bad. The salt included garlic oil, one piece of chashu, green onion, egg, bean sprouts, and ginger. The soy included, nori, one piece of chasu, egg, bean sprouts, and green onions. I personally felt mine was saltier than the salt one, but my friend had a different opinion. (We'll have to try it again some time and determine which is saltier)  The soup base wasn't too bad I've still had better, it wasn't very strong, the noodles they used were the really thin ones, but were cooked pretty well, as they weren't too soft or too hard. I don't usually eat pork but I took a bite out of the chashu and gave it to my friend as I knew it would have made me sick.   There were other items such as miso and spicy, along with their Fukumimi ramen, which seemed to include extra meat and corn. You can add other items to your ramen, such as corn, extra meat, egg, etc at a small extra cost. They have the extra noodle option but it's not on the menu.   It's a good place close to UNLV, so you don't have to travel deep into china town for ramen, or for those of us living on the east side it's a bit closer. =]", "Date": "2012-12-01", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Kai", "ReviewID": "_xpF-fjBoFejGrj0MGID_Q", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Excellent!

Fukumimi is an oasis in our (up until recently) ramen desert. It is traditional while still offering enough options to keep those that need variety happy.

Located outside of  asian food alley (spring mtn)  it is not as convenient for those traveling from the edges of town, but i promise you it is worth the trip.   The tonkotsu ramen is my goto dish.  The pork is the perfectly cooked  with just enough fat to enhance the flavor without ruining the consistency. The noodles are cooked to perfection. The flavors in the broth are pleasing with out being overpowering.  The portions are fine for a normal lunch or dinner. When i am super hungry I will usually ask for an additional order of noodles as soon as my ramen arrives. The second helping will arrive about half way thru the first.

My ramen was okay, the pieces of chashu were extremely fatty and falling apart. The broth was very salty without much flavor. I finished my bowl as I felt it was okay, not return worthy, but not gag worthy either. Jaime left practically entire bowl untouched. We also had a side of chicken kaarage of which I could not eat more than one small piece. The meat was just so fatty and poor quality while also drenched in grease.  The couple next to us with whom we struck up a conversation were not pleased with their food either, and left their bowls practically untouched. Maybe it was just a bad morning?

THE MEAT: I would prefer to eat here at night and without a hangover.  When we went in the afternoon, the sun was beating down the side of the restaurant and we were sweating like pigs (if pigs did sweat).  We had the chicken karaage (not very crispy, but light and very tender), gyoza (wasn't too impressed with the filing), saboro bowl (savory sweet ground meat), chasu bowl (not bad), the tonkatsu salt and tonkatsu miso ramen.    Normally I would complain about under-seasoning and pour soy sauce over everything, but this tonkatsu salt and miso broths were extremely salty.  The miso was definitely more flavorful than the salt version, and carried a spicy kick.  I didn't care too much for the ginger pieces and bean sprouts in the bowl, but the other elements were perfect - soft noodle strands, an almost cooked egg, thin melt-in-your-mouth chasu, scallions.  I wouldn't mind going back here especially since service is awesome, but for Hakata/Tonkatsu addicts, I'd still bet on Monta (their broth has stronger pork/egg flavors, bamboo shoots and wood ear mushrooms, Mmm).

Since we are on the east side the patrons eating are more diverse, unlike the eateries on Spring Mtn., which tend to attrack mainly Asians.  It is pretty small and only has a handful of tables so the last time I came it was pretty packed. Service has been good on both visits considering they are in a small area. I have ordered the tonkatsu ramen both times and I like it! I particularly like the corn. I prefer Fukumimi much more than Monta, but that's just my opinion. My friend ordered the Tantan and it really reminds us of Filipino karekare (peanut butter stew) a little different, but very similar. She enjoyed it and gave me a bite which was delish from what I remember. Last visit I also had the chicken karaage, this was good too and not too greasy.

It also has the pleasant drops of garlic oil on top too.  Midway through his ramen, he bit into a hard chunk of noodles.  It appeared that some of the noodles were stuck together and never got cooked through.  We showed the waitress the clumped up noodles and she took his ramen away.  She asked if he would like another one and got that order in immediately.  She apologized profusely and checked often to make sure the second round was fine.  It was and the Husband ate it all up.  I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen, Miso flavored ($8.20).  Along with the standard pork belly, green onions, seasoned egg, and bean sprouts, mine came with corn too.  No garlic oil unfortunately.  My soup was creamy and full-bodied and very rich.  Quite tasty in my opinion.  I was pleased with my soup choice.  I also liked their soft boiled egg, the seasoning part of it made it even tastier.  Other unique choices on their menu include: the Tantan Men which is a Szechuan style spicy soup with ground meat and bok choy; and the Tomato Ramen which is a cold ramen with sesame sauce and vinegar.

I expected it to be thicker and with less soup/sauce but the noodles never slurped up the soup that I had expected.  The taste was not as strong as I would have liked either.  The peanut flavor is pretty light.  The ground meat was sweeter than expected but at least it was hot and decent meal.  Small Curry Chicken Rice: Ordered this as a supplement to all of our ramen soups.  The curry flavor was not extremely spice-y.  It was also pretty light in terms of curry flavor.  Little pieces of chicken within the curry and also included were pickled radishes.  I actually enjoyed this more than my tan tan men but overall it was around a 3.5 star level.  Ramen is pretty big in Vegas and there are tons are other places I have found on Yelp.  This place is decent but it was a let down.

The wait staff is very efficient and friendly, and the wait was about 30 min for the large group that I was in (~8 people), but you'd probably get in with a smaller group.  I ordered the Fukumimi ramen which is a basically their standard ramen with more pieces of pork. The soup base was very flavorful and tasty. The pork was cooked well. I'm not an expert in ramen so I can't go into much further detail about the flavor, but overall the ramen was very delicious and I had no complaints about the food.  The karaage chicken is like fried chicken but Japanese style. It was mildly spicy and marinated for flavor. It was a good choice to order the chicken alongside the ramen.

Its on the corner of Eastern and Tropicana near the newly built Starbucks/Baskin Robins.   The place is kinda small but it never gets so packed to the point where you'd have to wait to be seated or served. Usually when you walk in, or the times I've gone anyway, we're immediately acknowledged by the server and immediately seated. Drinks usually come within the first 5 mins (or less) and our orders taken right away. I like how they don't shout the orders across the room like some ramen places do. I personally feel like thats a little tacky especially if it startles someone.   Im all about that Tonkatsu Shoyu Ramen with extra egg and thick noodles. They serve a generous portion with an almost full bowl of soup. It comes with mushrooms, bambu, green onions, bean sprouts, meat, and everything else you can add on for an extra cost. My favorite thing about this place is how perfectly they cook their half boiled egg and the fact that their soup is not overly salty. If you're not a pork kind of person they also have other selections like the Spicy Miso which is what my bf gets.   Their chashu bowl is also delicious if you're not interested in eating ramen. Their karaage is cooked to perfection every time but I'm more impressed with the little salad that it comes with. I can eat for days! Im not sure what kind of sauce they have on it but its delicious.

Reviews from Judd L, Nelson Q and Lisa R were making my pavlovian response take over and we went there on Sunday afternoon about 1:30 pm on a New Year weekend. Would have been perfect if the tour bus of people weren't there occupying the whole place....  1.  Ambiance - Small, perhaps it can seat about 35 people using all seats and  counter area.  Clean, small waiting place, open kitchen  2. Bathroom - You know how I am about asian restaurants (usually chinese) with good food and terribly awful bathrooms. Well this place is elegant.... Gotta have nice toilet ambiance to really relax....  3.  Service - I really like going to a noodle place and not everyone is yelling Irashaimasu so loud that I feel like I am at Disneyland.  The staff is very nice, efficient, pleasant, well mannered, attentive, japanese speaking.  4.  Food   Karaage - Oh this is a delicate and tender morsel of chicken.  Steaming hot, incredibly tasty.  It does not get better than this.  Edamame - Traditional with your basic salt and not all the fancy stuff like other places. This is just right to whet your appetite.  Chicken Bowl - If you are not liking or feeling like slurping, then this is it. I would probably have ordered the Chicken Curry Rice Bowl, as this one looked tasty but a bit sparse.  The wifey ordered it and we were all just getting over colds, so really did not share.  Fukumimi Ramen - A bit of pork belly, tonkotsu, egg, seaweed, very tasty and very nice broth. The broth was not over powering and was very simple but tasty.  TanTan Ramen - Interesting. Not too spicy, a more complex broth and a bit over powering. I prefered the delicate and light broth of the Fukumimi Ramen.  Miso Ramen - Tonkotsu with the miso sause.  My daughter liked it and she is quit the critic, so this must have been good.

Hahaha. At least, I think it was the shape of their bowls. At first glance, it seems like any normal bowl of ramen, but as you stop to take a picture, the top of the soup cools down so fast that it becomes this thick goey texture. A quick stir of the broth and it will be gone, only to be back within a few minutes. Not exactly sure what it is... But something tells me it might be oil or some cartilage from the pork bones?  I had the Tonkotsu Ramen (soy), and the flavor of the broth was decent. I wasn't too big of a fan of their noodles (I prefer monta's thicker noodles). My broth came with a slice of pork belly (chashu), half of a seasoned egg, green onions, bean sprouts, and a piece of seaweed.  The pork belly was a really big slice, and had a good proportion of meat and fat.  I would have preferred a whole egg, but since it was included free with the soup, there isn't any complaints there. Everything else was pretty standard. If you wanted any extra toppings (which I did not get), they are available for an EXTRA charge. I say extra in all caps because in my opinion, some of them are a bit pricey.  I went with a friend who ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen (salt) as well as the karaage.  Her broth tasted a bit off, and there were black lines visible throughout. I'm not sure what kind of 'salt' they used, but I guess it was a type of black salt?(Update: I've been told the 'black lines' were from black garlic oil). Looked pretty odd to me. Oh, and her soup also had the thick gooey texture at the top if you let it sit for too long.  As for the karaage, they were pretty standard. Nice and juicy like they should be!  I would definitely be back to try more items on their menu, and I'll update my review then. For now, I give it 3 stars due to the weird thickening of the top of the soup.

Now onto the ramen, I ordered Tonkotsu-Shio (salt) and my friend got their miso. I thought there was too much garlic oil on my bowl but it didn't  foul  my ramen so I have no complaints. The noodles here are the thin kind and I'm a big fan of Sora's thick noodles, but as long as the noodles are cooked perfectly it's all good in the neighborhood. Their broth was delicious. It was rich and flavorful. I never finish  drinking  the soup of any noodle bowl (ramen, udon, pho, etc.) but for the first time I finally reached the bottom. I also had a taste of my friend's miso broth and thought that it was pretty tasty as well. So much so that I intend to order miso on my next visit. I'm not a miso fan so this is serious haha!

ON A SIDE NOTE: I feel like Monta is overrated since it has dominated the ramen scene in Vegas for a long time now. People forget that there are alternatives and other  executions  of ramen, and that die-hard Monta lovers become stagnant in their taste profile (there, I said it). Maybe I'm just feeling this way because the last three times I've been there (within a span of 2 years), my broth was always freaking salty! Even their mini bowls were also salty.

I split the kara age (fried chicken) appetizer ($3.90) with my friends and ordered the basic tonkotsu (salt) ($7.50). The kara age had such good flavor even without condiments, and the salt, lemon, and salad are all nice complements. The tonkotsu ramen was fantastic. The noodles were soft, the meat was tender, the broth was rich and not overly salty whatsoever, and the half egg seems like it underwent some sort of magical transformation to make it seem almost not so eggy in flavor. The whole bowl was a great way to make yourself sweat again in these colder months.  My only regrets are that I didn't really mix well and thus ended up with a decent helping  of julienne ginger at the end, which is kinda strong for me in actual chewing (vs. merely flavoring), and that I didn't know that one of my non-present friends gets free appetizers each time because it's just four stamps (read: four people).

However, it wasn't all that I thought it was going to be.  My mom, who I was with, ordered ramen and she said it was good. No elaboration. I ordered the curry rice along with an order of the chicken karaage. Both were okay. We were both a little disappointed in the portion sizes. They were a little small for the price.  We decided not to eat there because it was a little busy and we didn't want to be squished up to another party because the restaurant is small. What we did like was that everything was packed separately. The noodles were separate from the broth. When we got home, we ate right away but the food wasn't hot. It was less than a 10 minute drive from the restaurant back to my house, so that was surprising. It also took almost half an hour for us to get our order.  The food was okay. The curry didn't have anything noticeably special about it. There were no vegetables and the chicken mentioned in the description was also missing. I was glad I got the karaage to go with it. But I was a little disappointed in the karaage. It was a little on the dry side.  Overall, I don't know if I'd be going back again if I was the one making the decision.

All come fairly quickly when ordered, cooked perfectly, and taste great.  I've tried their extra fragrant garlic oil ramen soup, their tantanmen, and various additional types of ramen that they offer here.  All offer that 'just what the doctor ordered' feeling once you taste that first sip.  The star of the shop is none other than their Fukumimi Ramen, a pork-based ramen with thin noodles, seaweed, boiled egg, and an ample amount of pork chashu.  Other additions come with a small charge but may be worth it if you like such items as added corn, extra egg, extra chashu, or bamboo sprouts.  The broth is rich and salty but not over-the-top.  It's definitely soothing to the soul on a cold night but contagiously good that I would even eat it on a hot summer's day.    I have even ordered to-go for work for myself and all my work colleagues.   The noodles come separately with the pork belly on top and a separate styrofoam container contains the hot broth ready to be poured onto the noodles.  The soup remains just as delicious as ever.

I was in the middle of ordering and the table next to me began speaking to her in her native tongue and she straight up left me with the words in my mouth to get them sodas. Kind of rude I would say! I asked for an order of gioza and they told me they did not have any! WHAT? Why have it on the menu if you do not serve it, let alone carry it? You can not eat ramen and not accompany it with gioza! So I ordered tan tan mein noodles with much anticipation. When my bowl arrived, the bowl looked liked they had poured milk in it. The noodles were creamy?!?! Real tan tan mein noodles are composed of a spicy broth not a spicy milky broth like if it was curry. I understand there are many versions on how to make tan tan mein but this one was wayyyyy too creamy The ground pork was alright but it did not have great consistency, it was a bit like sand in my opinion. I'm on a tan tan mein fix so if anyone knows of a better place, please do tell.", "Date": "2013-09-18", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Brooke", "ReviewID": "lTvmbkM4sH6-YDVsomHZlA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "This restaurant has a focused menu - ramen and rice bowls - and everything is delicious!

Not too bready, served piping hot with a small salad and you dip it into their salt/pepper mix. We dipped it into the chili powder and that made it even yummier! - Fukumimi ramen - this was pretty good! Rich broth, but not too salty. Generous portions of noodles (on the thinner side, kinda soba-ish) - Tantan men (with an egg added) - rich, thick and creamy broth. The ground pork was sweet and savory at the same time and the noodles were more eggy and curly.  SERVICE: Can't complain! Seated right away, food came out hot and quick. Friendly smiles all around.   VENUE: Cute! Rather spacious for a ramen spot. Tables along the right side and counter seating on the left. Casual, relaxed vibe.  PARKING: Plenty!

Ramen is one of our favorite dishes and we are always up for trying new places. We thought that maybe we would be able to find a new ramen spot. When we first looked at the menu we were surprised by the low prices, the lowest we've seen. Especially with it coming with corn and chashu?! We thought that was awesome. I ordered the Tonkatsu, miso ramen with nori (which our server didn't refer to as nori and seemed a bit confused until she realized it was seaweed).   After a short wait, and being served I realized why the prices were so low. The bowls are really small and they actually don't have much food in them at all. After my first sip of the broth, I was sadly let down. There was almost no flavor. In my entire bowl I maybe had about 10 kernels of corn and 1 piece of chashu. I wish I had known. I would've asked for extra and paid for the extra. My bf ordered the Kara-miso, spicy miso ramen and he was so disappointed. The broth tasted like hot sauce. He ordered the chashu bowl as well and was honestly more excited about that.  After finishing our food, we awkwardly waited for about 15 minutes for someone to come back and bring us our check. The new server even took the couple's order next to us, ignored me, took care of two other tables before she acknowledged me and brought us our check.   There is honestly nothing special here. The ramen tastes instant and I really hope the ramen in Japan has something better to offer than this place.

They offer chicken broth based ramen for those who aren't down with the pork base. There are cold noodles salads, rice bowls and some appetizers as well.   I haven't had tantan men ramen in ages, but I used to be in love with it when I was a kid. It's a bit Chinese influenced ramen, with a chile sesame soup with ground meat, scallion, bok choy. If you like dan dan noodles, you probably would enjoy this. Fukumimi has a solid tantan-men with a good broth and nicely chewy noodles.   Mini chasu bowl was also good and for a  mini  it was a sizeable portion. The only thing is I thought it was going to be sliced chasu like what is in the ramen, which I think I prefer. Instead, it is shredded up pieces that seems to be mixed with a bit of soy.   I also tried a bite of my cousins karaage. It wasn't bad, but could have been a tad more crispy even though I enjoyed the flavor and texture overall.  The service was decent enough, my drink was refilled a few times throughout the meal.

Every time I try a Japanese restaurant I have to try their Agedashi Tofu. My favorite dashi sauce is at Ichiza in Chinatown but Fukumimi's Agedashi is coming up at number two. Two really good sized deep fried tofu pieces and their dashi sauce was not salty at all like some other places. FIVEEEEE STARS!!

The best tonkotsu ramen I've tried so far in Vegas is made at this modest establishment, located in a mostly-dead strip mall. The broth is marvelously rich and flavorful. The noodles are perfectly cooked, not too firm nor soggy and absorb the noodle base's flavor. The egg is amazingly seasoned and I've never had a yolk that was so buttery and rich. The chashu is a bit thicker than at Monta's, cooked to the perfect level of tenderness. You can appreciate the meat and its slow-cooked flavor in your mouth instead of just instantly falling apart as soon as you bite into it. At times I sort of wish they served menma instead of bean sprouts but its by no means a detractor to the ramen.   The spicy ramen isn't necessarily  spicy  - I think the heat is there to mainly enhance the soup base and it doesn't mask the other flavors in the soup.   I easily get full on a bowl of ramen (or any entree) so I don't usually get side dishes/appetizers when I eat out. Fukumimi, though, does offer a stamp card and offers free karaage after four ramen visits (and served to you on your fifth), so I ended up trying that. It was definitely not what I was expecting, the fried chicken was deliciously seasoned, the dark meat tender and juicy and the grey salt provided on the side gave the dish more punch. Wasn't a big fan of the dressing on the greens that came with the chicken, but my boyfriend really liked it, so there you go.  You'll need to ask for additional condiments if you like to add seasonings to your dish, since they're not provided on the tables. Interestingly at Monta I often reach for their condiments and use most of them in my ramen, but here I don't find myself missing them - for me, the ramen is that good as it is. Decor is minimal and clean. Sort of wish it was a bit more warm rather than plain plywood but whatever, we're here for food not lodging. Service is a-ok, no complaints there.

I've only been to one other Ramen place beside Fukumimi and I liked Fukumimi better, so this is where we like to go. So when my stepfather, the judo sensei/shinto priest who lived in Japan for over 20 years visited and asked where we should go for Ramen, I just hoped Fukumimi would live up to his standard.  We were a party of 5 and had to wait about 15 minutes for a table on a busy Saturday night. It's a little tough to wait in such a crowded front area, but luckily the turnover is really fast, and really, once we sat down to eat it was totally worth it. For an appetizer, we ordered gyoza and the Kimchi. The gyoza were wrapped paper thin, crispy on one side, and piping hot. Delicious. The Kimchi was perfectly spicy and a good portion.   Almost everyone in our party had something different: the Miso Tonkatsu was creamy and had a light sweetness imparted by the addition of corn, the Salt (Soy) Tonkatsu was a salty, full-bodied soup given added depth with seaweed and green onions, the Spicy Tonkatsu was medium-spicy yet still almost creamy in it's richness, and the large size (sweet) pork bowl with rice and green onions hit the spot for a heartier eater. Oh, and PERFECT eggs and tender pork belly in each bowl, my favorite part. The proteins in these Ramens just melt in your mouth.   My stepdad said this is as good as any highly regarded Ramen shop in every city he lived in in Japan. He just kept saying  This is SO good!  over and over. He and my mom are in town one more week and he's jonesing for more Fukumimi one of these nights after he plays judo. So thanks for making me look good when I recommended we visit - regardless, this will always be this girl's Ramen joint.

Went yesterday 1-24-16 around 8PM for dinner.  This restaurant is located on Eastern and Tropicana next to Baskin Robbins.  It's kind of a small space....there's room for maybe 20 people.  It was quite crowded.  .  For just over $25.00 we got some ramen, two appetizers, two drinks, a salad, a chicken curry, and some tasty corn and rice for my boy.  I was wondering why it was so cheap but then I saw a sign on the wall that said  Free appetizer with purchase of ramen .   . I got the tonkotsu ramen (soy) and it was a very generous portion.  The broth was flavorful and just the right temperature.  It had a nice big slice of pork, a perfectly soft boiled egg, a sheet of nori, and bean sprouts.  The noodles were cooked perfectly.  Next time I think I'll try it spicy! I wanted to add some spice but there are no condiments on the table and I wasn't quite sure what to ask for to make it spicy.  *White girl problems*.  Sriracha?? I dunno.  .  Chicken Karaage- Delicious dark meat chicken lightly floured and fried to perfection.  Juicy, flavorful, crunchy, delicious!  .  Husband had the chicken curry and was practically licking the bowl after he inhaled it.  I got one bite of it and it was heavenly.  The chicken is mixed into the curry which I've never had before but it was really good.  Their rice is just about the best I've ever had...perfectly cooked, sticky, and aromatic.  .  This is really close to my house and I have a feeling they'll be seeing a lot more of me.  My only complaint would be that there is absolutely *no* place to wait inside the restaurant.  The foyer is microscopic.   Also while we were there a young man turned in an application/resume and all the staff members gathered around and laughed at it before they trashed it.

I'm really excited since this place is so close to where I live!  Ok before anything else I just want to say that there is an old lady server that works here, and I think she hates me. I've been here twice and was treated with the same discourteous attitude. I tipped her $5 each time in hopes of a smile but to no avail...  Now that I got that off my chest it's down to business.  Fukumimi is known for their Tan Tan Men, (a spicy, very rich ramen) and their flaky karaage (fried battered chicken tenders that is a perfect match to your warm bowl of ramen).   Lets start of with the noodles. Just like Monta Ramen House, they serve their ramen with firm noodles, I personally prefer Sapporo style noodles since it's more chewy, but there's nothing wrong with Fukumimi's straighter and firmer noodles.  The base of the Tan Tan men is hot and tasty. I had no problem slurping down their savory and slightly spicy ramen until I reached 3/4 of the bowl, at that point I was overwhelmed by its richness. Now I'm the kind of person who gets the XL bowls and order side dishes all over the table, yes that's me, but on this occasion, it was just a bowl of ramen and a side of karaage, but with just that I was already feeling heavy.  It's a well known fact that you can't have a bowl of hot ramen (in america) without chasu pork (those thinly sliced marinated braised pork bellies that melts in your mouth as you sip your steaming bowl of ramen).  Also adding a Tamago  (24 hour marinated hard boiled egg) with every ramen bowl wouldn't hurt.  Summary:  Noodles: Firm noodles Ramen Base (Tan Tan Men):  Mild, Tasty, and Heavy Chasu pork: Thicker cut than usual, and not melt -in-your-mouth like Monta's Karaage: Chicken is tender, and Batter is nice and flaky.

They have one of the best ramen in Vegas. They have one of the best karaage. They have one of the best cold noodle.  What's lacking is the finishing touch in the noodles - namely, the softness of the noodle.  If you are crazy about ramen, you might know that there are more than six grades of softness / hardness of noodles when you order ramen in Japan: soft, regular, hard, barikata, harigane and konaotoshi.  It gets harder as you get to the end of the list - in Japanese, barikata means  very hard ,  harigane  means steel wire,  konaotoshi  means  just drop the powder . As ridiculous as it sounds, those resolution in texture preference is for real in highly matured culture like Japanese cuisine.

I order the Soy Ramen which is a thinner soup base compared to the Miso Ramen. It can be a little salty but nothing too overwhelming. It comes with noodles, a boiled egg, a thin slice of soft char siu pork, a piece of seaweed, and bean sprouts (which I ask for on the side). As for the taste, it is very savory, fresh, and original.  As for my BF, he orders the Tantanmen which is a chile base ramen. I have  tried  it but never really eaten it. He loves it, but from what I have tried, it is a little spicy from the chile, and has a very herby and earthy kind of taste (I think they use sriracha for flavoring). It comes with bok-choy, noodles, a scoop of ground beef, and some other vegetable. You'll definitely want to get a side of rice with this one.  Sodas are served in a can, I don't think there are free refills. Items can also be made to-go.  * Atmosphere, wait-time, and menu size: 4/5 Restaurant is located on Eastern in an older plaza and is right next to a Baskin Robins (which tastes great after eating here, since it can be a little salty). Restaurant is very casual and tiny but even during the busiest hours, I have not had any trouble getting a seat. As for the menu, it is small and very straightforward.  * Portion size and price: 5/5 GREAT price and large portions! Both soups fill us up and cost only $8.99 each.  * Recommend or return? Of course I will return! They also gave me a punch card for a free item after several visits. Make sure you ask for it.  Though, for those of you who are coming here for the first time and don't have a normal  noodle diet , I recommend taking it easy (don't rush eating).

I enjoy it, I eat it, I seek it out. But I am not the local ramen expert that I know some of my fellow Yelpers are.   But I know soulful, textured, thoughtful food. And Fukumimi Ramen is serving that in droves.   SERVICE: Like any restaurant, the experience starts with a greeting. The staff there is wonderful. They are warm, informative, helpful, and even on a busy night, they are willing to make yours a pleasurable experience.  There are not enough places in town that care about how their customers are treated. I like to give my business to those who do.  FOOD: I have never had anything like their broth. It's rich and complex. At my first bite, my taste buds were prepped for a thin, savory broth. But upon tasting what Fukimimi Ramen calls a broth, I had to stop and pause. I actually put my chopsticks and spoon down to reflect. When was the last time a taste of broth gave you pause? Since I had the Fukumimi Ramen I can only speak about its pleasures. Add the noodles, the green onion, the extra pork belly, and the egg to that rich broth and you have a dish to drive all the way to Eastern and Trop to try.  The Fukumimi and the karaage are spectacular.  The karaage is a salty, tender, perfectly fried piece of chicken.  But all of its crunchy pleasures could not take away from that ramen dish.  And three cheers for their portion sizes. It was a joy not to be swimming in ridiculous amounts of uneaten food after my meal.  THE REVELATION: The egg. I don't know if theirs is completely unique, but it was certainly unique to me. It is officially my favorite egg. I unsuccessfully tried to coax a secret out of the chef. All I know is this: I could eat that soy sauce flavored egg every day of my life. Every day. They are magic. I need to find out if there is a dish that is focused on eggs there. The eggs are that serious for me.  TIPS: They have a frequent visitor card that entitles you to a karaage (I believe) after a few visits. Also, they have  small space, so you might want to pop in at an off time to ensure you get the experience during a quiet time. They get some traffic in the evenings.  Don't let the neighborhood keep you away. It's in a working class area that is located next to a busy street (Trop)--no need to pull up and be concerned.    They've been open for a little over a week, and I've been back three times. I know people are excited about getting the gyoza going, but there is so much to love there that foodies will never miss it.    I plan to add this to my place to my regular rotation. Their location next to a Baskin and Robbins may become an issue this summer, but luckily I leave so satisfied that ice cream isn't even a consideration.  At least not on a chilly November night.  They deserve every one of those five stars. This place is outstanding.

So if any of you guys are hesitant about the layer of questionable black oily liquid floating in your broth, know that it's good for your tummy, your heart, and your soul.

It's not as hearty as some tonkotsu broths I've tried in the past, but it still packs a punch taste-wise. Best part of this broth is that it's not overly salty like some other ramen places...*cough* Monta *cough*  The only noodles available here are the thinner egg style noodles that regularly come with tonkotsu ramen. Even though I prefer thick noodles (Ramen Sora!!) the noodles here were perfectly al dente, not soggy at all.  The egg is always perfectly done with the yolk still half runny. Chashu is a bit well done compared to what I prefer. I love when that delicious pork belly melts in your mouth!  Soboro bowl: seasoned minced meat, egg, rice, and green onions. Very simple dish. I felt like this dish was just okay, not really memorable or something I would crave. I'd have liked a bit more of sauce/juice/gravy from the minced meat so it wouldn't be so dry.

The service was good. The server women were extremely nice and quick.   Then came the food. I ordered the Kogashi Ramen ($8.20) which supposedly has good amount of garlic flavor or whatever because of my love for Monta's Kuro Ramen aka black garlic. The bowl was smaller than Monta's, good presentation. The flavor was nothing garlicky or full of aroma like I expected. It was good broth, very peppery, but not good enough. I didn't like the noodles. The SUPER weird thing that I HATED was the addition bean sprout, though it was my fault for not fully read the description. The broth flavor was completely overwhelmed by the bean sprout for me. Extremely tender and flavorful Chashu but the pieces were wayyyyyy to small, almost seemed like they disappeared into the noodles.  My friend got a Fukumimi Ramen ($9.50) and it was the most disappointing bowl of noodles. She got it because it said  extra Chashu  but turned out, she got way less meat than I did. Extra means more than 3 but she got exactly 3 pieces. Maybe they were way too small in size that they weren't significant enough. The broth was okay, nothing notable. To be honest she disliked it. I didn't think it was worth it for the price or the way they described it on the menu. We didn't want to compare this place to Monta, but even the people who were sitting behind us mentioned about Monta in their conversation so...  We also got Karaage Chicken which is Japanese fried chicken. It was supposed to be an appetizer but we got it AT THE END of the meal. I was annoyed. But I thought it was okay, but a little over-salted. They used dark meat that's very tender. Very good coating. The thing is, they had like a pile of overdressed salad with very liquidy dressing so it soaked the fried chicken pieces. The chickens were soggy after a while. I don't think the addition of salad was necessary because why???  Overall we just didn't enjoy the restaurant as much as how I anticipated it. I get why they have the stamp system or the  eat 4 ramens get a free appetizer  to attract customers but it just didn't work for me. Everything was missing a notch of goodness to get to that level.

FukUmimi.......don't know what that means, but all I know is that it translates into some fuk'n good ramen! and even though this place is on the other side of town away from the competition, it is sure to make all other ramen places sweat. I can't say that is the best but it is sure up there with the big Monta and Sora.  I ordered the miso ramen. The broth was thick and packed with intense flavors, the noodles were soft and chewy, the slices of pork also soft as butter. It all was gone in a matter of minutes. Left me wondering if it had actually been real, but the empty bowl, the bill on the table and my hunger gone, confirmed it all. I had just had a bowl of awesomeness.   The place is small but very inviting, the simplicity of the design a very common Japanese characteristic gives it the feel of authenticity, as well as the majority of customers at that time. Koreans? Japanese? I don't know..all I know is that this Mexican was enjoying his noodles like everyone else in the building. For one brief  tasty moment in time, we were all speaking the same ramen language. slurp! slurp! slurp!

I'm not completely sold to choosing them over Monta, but their slice of pork is pretty thick and impressive! Also tender. I highly recommend their tonkatso miso ramen as I love that nice thick broth. It was filled with corn, green onions, and medium boiled egg.   The noodles have a nice chew to it. Not too soggy and not too under cooked either. The broth was full of flavor. The pork had that nice consistency of chewiness, and the ramen all together was full of flavor.   I also recommend the fried gyoza as a side, and their homemade kimchee. Not up for ramen. I highly RECOMMEND the Chasu bowl (pork and white rice, with ginger). It's so delish and it too is full of flavor. It has a very subtle sweetness to it which I love and is also very tender and nicely marinated. I think if the ramen doesn't win me over from Monta, I'd say their Chasu bowl does.   The vibe also brings out that nice grassroots local Japanese feel with the small establishment, wooden seats, and specials hand written and posted on the walls. The location is very off from what most typical Japanese restaurants are, and is a bit out of the way for me, but if you're in that side of town or have that nice gap between classes from UNLV it would be a nice place for lunch. I have yet to try their sesame broth which I think is also one of their signature ramen bowls. I'm not fond of the sesame flavor though as those flavors are typically too strong for my taste buds.

I had to try it for myself.  I said to myself,  this place must be good,  considering my lady isn't a big ramen eater due to her carb conflicts.    So we come in on a Sunday after a long night of partying with good friends...once inside, you can immediately smell the fresh handmade ramen being drained from boiling pots...good sign.  The service is fast friendly and accommodating...another good sign. The crowd, diverse and was a good mixture of sophisticated, casual, multi aged and ethnic heads that I would like to think have a respect for some Japanese ramen other than meals out the instant dinner section at your local grocery store.  I checked out the menu and could see myself ordering numerous dishes...so if in doubt, go with the flagship dish, which was the Fukumimi ramen.  Let's throw in some karaage chicken as well...HiYah!  As the bowl came out, it was aesthetically appealing to say the least.  A pair of nori paper sheets lined the far side of the bowl, the ramen was nicely bunched and the broth was drizzled with some additives that made the dish look mouth watering.    5-7 minutes later...  The bowl was demolished and the verdict is...not bad.  I would say its more on the modern variations of ramen versus the authentic versions Monta offers.  The broth is good and not overwhelming with too much or too little flavoring.  The Chashu is similar to red charsiu roast pork versus the fatty version Monta offers.  I personally like the fatty version, but I can see others settling for the healthier choice.   I still remember Tenkaippen back in Waikiki, Hawaii, which I worked for a day, and it reminded me began to think of all the ramen places back home, including Goma-Tei that I would say is the closest resemblance that I could compare to Fukumimi.  I would rather Monta, now that I know to add more hot water to their broth since it is a little salty for my taste.

Hands down my favorite. The broth here is not too salty, but also not too flavorless.  Downside - located on the East side near UNLV, so a bit of the drive for anyone not in that area. Also the venue is quite small so expect to wait if you're going around dinner time (especially on a weekend). Generally speaking, the waits aren't too long. I think the most I ever had to wait was 20~25 minutes but we were a party of 6 in such a teeny place.  Do note this place does include a bar so you have the option to sit there if no tables are available. :)  Onto the food... Well, I've tried just about every ramen plate on this menu that is not labelled spicy and I like each and every one. I personally prefer thin noodles over the thick ones, so you may notice some bias in my favorite dishes (hint: they're all thin noodles). Luckily one of the menus on the table should list out what is thin and what is thick.  My favorite dishes in order: 1. Kogashi - the menu describes this as a fragrant flavored ramen and that is 100% true. Drinking the broth side by side with the other flavors, this ramen broth has a strong flavor which I personally prefer. It is topped with fragrant garlic oil and fried onion. My favorite. If you like garlic-y and onion-y flavors, I bet you this is your favorite too (but trust me, it isn't overpowering and still delish) 2. Tonkotsu - I prefer the soy over the salt one (though the salt one is good too). This is simply but very delicious. Again, I like Fukumimi because unlike other ramen places, the broth is not TOO salty, but at the same time, it still has enough flavor to enjoy! 3. Fukumimi Ramen - they say this is their most popular dish (maybe because it's the name of their restaurant?) Either way, I do like this!

Green onion and bean sprouts. There are only two selections in this category. The Tori Ramen is flavored with a salt based sauce, topped with chicken cha shu and garlic oil. Then there is the Classic Ramen bowl in which the broth is flavored with soy sauce, topped with pork belly cha shu. They go for $7.50.

I thought the broth was pretty good and I say this cause I had better broths; more flavorful, with a slightly richer broth, with a house-made black garlic oil and garlic chips on top - a house blend of chili sauce and fresh chili for those who love their broth extra spicy. This would have made it more flavorful.  The honey garlic chicken was just ok, nothing really special. I would recommend they cook the chicken to well done then cooking with deep fried batter. And not to just use plan mayo, but to flavor their mayo blended with sweet and spicy chili sauce. I've had this prepared before and it was again more flavorful.  That's the reason I only rated it a 4/5 stars. I've had the same at these bistros before and better and this is my reason I couldn't rate it a 5.

Most of it sounded line ramen from any of the other ramen place in town.  I asked for a suggestion and asked if I like spicy. I do, do I was recommended the karo-miso spicy ramen. Also ordered the Soboro bowl. Both items came out really quick. The bowl was rice with ground meat with onions and scallions. It was tasty. Savory with a touch of sweet.  I like spicy food a lot, and many times restaurants that say their food is spicy, it doesn't hit the spot, however this ramen has a good kick. It isn't Hannah or anything, but enough that extra spice isn't necessary. The broth is rich and flavorful, not too salty. The noodle itself has a nice bite to it. Was once told that good ramen should have a elastic spring when you bite it. Which these definitely do.  Lastly the prices are decent. Definitely will return.

My idea of ramen was of the six cent variety. When I went to Japan this year, I knew to avoid Ramen because it was pork-based, and I never went to Monta or Sora because I was told the point of ramen is pork broth. As everyone would guess, my inability to try a tasty Japanese dish is rather difficult.  I just assumed it was noodles and broth with lots of sodium.  However, upon learning Fukumimi had chicken ramen, I knew I could finally taste what the excitement is all about. After proctoring the LSAT today, I worked up quite an appetite and headed over to Fukumimi.  I ordered the chicken ramen and not long after, the chef brought out to me a steaming bowl. The bowl was a huge amount, with broth, noodles, chicken  chasiu , bean sprouts, negi (green onions), and a half egg.  This chicken broth would make a Jewish grandmother's toes curl!  It was sooooo flavorful.  I have had my chicken soup training (my aunt told me it would make me marriageable) but mine does not have this richness. The broth itself is a star, but with the noodles, sliced chicken, green onions, sprouts, and the soy-soft boiled egg, it is truly a great balanced meal.  The noodles were the perfect texture, and I added some shichimi to add some spice to the bowl. I saved the egg for the end, and it was perfectly cooked.  I love eggs like this!  This was truly OISHI!  The chef told me he is from Kyoto, so we talked about Kyoto and I showed him a few pictures from when I visited this May. Chicken ramen with tax is only $8.11.  If you are like me and prefer that pigs fly rather than sizzle, this is the only spot in town to indulge in ramen.  The restaurant itself is quaint and clean, the staff is very friendly, and the food is yum (though my options are limited!) - they gave me a stamp card so for every 4 bowls of ramen I buy, I get a free kara-age (or you pork eaters get a free gyoza).

We ate during off-peak hour but I can imagine it gets crowded quickly. My 3 friends and I were seated right away and started with chicken karaage and agedashi tofu as appetizers. Both were really good! The chicken was super juicy and crisp. Although we couldn't tell if it was the red light from the store sign reflecting off the meat or if it was slightly undercooked- we just ate it because it was tasty.   I ordered the Tan Tan, which did not fulfill my ramen craving. It was a little too creamy for me, with a peanut aftertaste. I normally love all noodles+broth, but this broth didn't hit the spot. My boyfriend really liked it though so we ended up switching our bowls. He ordered the Fukumimi which in my opinion was a lot better. The broth was lighter and I enjoyed it more.

We had the mother-in-law with us, who's been on a strict low sodium diet, so what better way to mess with her than take her to a Ramen house ...pure evil.  I was intrigued by the Tan Tan Men (I prefer Tan Tan Women...groan, I know). Since starting this Ramen quest of mine, I've started to experiment at home with making my own version of Tan Tan (Wo)Men. I was curious how Fukumini's meat compared to Sora's and mine. The flavor profiles of all 3 are very similar with tasting the likeness of Toban Djan (Chili Bean Sauce), sweetness from Mirin and hints of garlic. I think my recipe is pretty close. Service was excellent and on point. We arrived just before the dinner rush and were seated right away. There was a bit of anxiety on our part during the first few minutes of walking in as the aromas permeating  were quite unpleasant and offensive. But the poopy odor soon dissipated and were replaced by more pleasant cooking bouquets. We started with an order of GYOZA which was the best I've had. It was well seasoned and something better than any of the dumplings I've had in Chinatown. The TAN TAN MEN was delicious! Flavorful rich broth that wasn't too salty and thick noodles that had a nice chew to them. My bowl was the envy of everyone at my table who ordered other varieties such as the Classic Ramen in a chicken based broth and the Tonkatsu Soy Ramen. Fortunately for my MIL, they offered a low sodium version of each broth to save her from sporting kankles. My wife who is a picky eater, which is why I suggested the Classic Ramen, wanted to switch with my bowl of Tan Tan Men after tasting it. Being the picky eater, she gives me her Chashu so I thought it would be a win/win situation. We will probably be back sooner than later so she can get her Tan Tan Women.  The Chashu was very tender. My daughter didn't enjoy her Tonkatsu Soy Ramen as much because she said it wasn't as well seasoned, but getting her nana's accidental order of extra Chashu made up for it. I think Fukumini will be a regular spot for us to hit up on cold nights since it's on our side of town and similar to Ramen Sora.

By its appearance, the broth looks spicy but it was not as spicy as I thought it would be. Compared to other ramen places in Las Vegas the broth is actually spicy, other places just put a ton of spicy powder to make it  spicy .

Located in an inconspicuous strip mall at the corner of Tropicana and Eastern, this is a true neighborhood ramen joint where one is always greeted enthusiastically at the door and local Japanese residents can always be spotted as regulars.  The decor is minimalist but modern and service is prompt and non-overbearing.    Appetizers that stand out are the karaage (Japanese fried chicken) and the gyoza (pork/chicken pot stickers).  The chicken is served fresh out of the fryer with a nice crispy exterior and juicy interior with a hint of ginger accentuated with a squeeze of fresh lemon whereas the gyoza have a nice char and the dough skin and filling are light enough to leave room for the main course.    After consuming 15+ bowls of ramen on multiple lunch break visits from work, the key words describing the soups here are consistency and balance.  Whereas I've had a few instances at Ramen Sora and Monta where the soups were either too salty or too bitter (black garlic oil was literally blackened garlic),  the broths here all have a creamy rich depth of flavor and are not overly cloying in the mouth so the resistance to reaching for additional spoonfuls of broth once the noodles are finished is quite low.  Noodles come in thick and thin varieties with decent texture although lacking any true inherent flavor only found at the top joints.    The standout broth for me is one of the relative newcomers on the menu: the kogashi (or burnt miso) ramen.  I've waxed poetic before on the Mallard reaction in chemistry  applied to food in a previous review(nerd alert!) but here again is yet another example of the magical powers of applying heat to rearrange amino acids and simple sugars to create a new unique flavor.  By charring miso paste, not only is there an intense aroma given off by the broth upon arriving at your table, but the flavor profile retains the savory note of the fermented soybeans we all know and love in miso but also has additional complex notes with an almost caramelized sweetness and a hint of bitterness that is pleasing on the tongue.  The crispy fried onions topping the noodles further enhance the umami tsunami.   I wish I could comment on the tan-tan men (spicy Szechuan style broth), but alas my first experience was on a full stomach from a previous meal so I must defer one to read other fellow yelper's raves on this other unique offering.  For the most part, the choices here are safe and reliably consistent, much like dating the girl next door, but if you're in the mood for something a little more adventuresome and unpredictable, the krazy kogashi ramen or the spicy and fiery tan tan men are worthy  fuku-mi-mi  one night stands (had to do it,  the name of the joint is just begging for a little humorous acknowledgment!)    P.S.  Don't forget to partake in their generous punch-card system where one is entitled to a free order of gyoza or karaage with every fourth bowl of ramen purchased!", "Date": "2013-12-24", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Shirley", "ReviewID": "RsgxdFkdaIqJZq4qcrY7qg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Ramen..aka soul food Japanese style! After seeing it popup on the Yelp radar and reading some of the rave reviews from Tetsuro P. & Ursula U (who told me to get my butt over here)..Well I just had to see for myself.  I have to say this ramen house is on the path to being the cream of the crop! Now I know that 101 ways to make ramen doesn't qualify me as the noodle connoisseur, but compared to others noodle houses I've tried, hands down, Fukumimi rocks!    Location: End corner of strip mall on Eastern/Tropicana ..plenty of parking spaces. A big plus for those of us whose home base is here in Henderson.     Service/Atmosphere - A - The restaurant staff enthusiastically greeted us in Japanese as we stepped inside.  It was almost a full house when we arrived during the dinner hour, but we were seated right away. The hostess also did double duty as our server.  Friendly and pretty efficient considering how busy the place was. The small dining area was simple interior, single seating at the high top top counter facing the kitchen and tables of two lined back against the wall set close together. So close that nosy me got to see and question the party next to me on what dish she ordered that looked so good, which was the Fukumimi ramen.   Food:  A+  - Prices: fair most under $10  We ordered the Fukumimi Ramen, Karaage & Curry/rice bowl.   Both Karaage & Curry bowl were very good, for the low price hard not to pass up either.  The Fukumimi - THE BEST!! This order is pretty large portion. The bowl width is average size, but deep in depth. It looked like a gourmet bowl of ramen, a pretty visual presentation. Seaweed lined half of the bowl filled with hot and steamy broth.  The tonkotsu (pork) broth ; perfect! It was packed with flavor, had a brown milky color, rich and creamy.  The thin noodles were delish and cooked to the right texture. Toppings: slices pork belly, tender, 1/2 of soft boiled egg, sprouts added some crunch and the scallions boosted the flavor even more. I want to say it's garlic infused oil, black in color that was drizzled on top as well.  This was such a delicious hearty meal.

The first time I saw it I noticed it was in a very seemingly lonely plaza on the corner of Tropicana and Eastern, not really an attention grabber but in my search for some great Japanese ramen I figured I would give it a shot. With my affinity for small mom and pop businesses this was totally a place for me and let me tell you, it didn't disappoint one bit! When I walked it, it had a very welcoming environment. You're greeted as you walk in the door and are told to pick a seat of your liking. A menu is presented, one with few choices but those few choices are there because that is what they specialize in and what you will love even if at first you think you won't. I chose the Japanese fried chicken to start. The seasoning was perfect! Simple seasoning of salt, white pepper, floured then deep fried. Super juicy and tender served along a mixed greens salad with a Japanese vinaigrette. Very tasty! The ramen that I selected was the Tonkatsu Ramen (salt). I am a big fan of this type of ramen so when I ordered it I had very high expectations. The presentation of the ramen was beautiful. The stock was dark and full of flavorful collagen, the pork was cooked to perfection the point of it falling apart in the broth and the half egg on top had a perfectly creamy yolk that any egg lover would die for. The ramen noodles were al dente as well. The base of the ramen was extremely flavorful. You could tasted the love and time that it took to make this delicious dish.  I would gladly visit this restaurant again to try the different types of ramen that they offer. To anyone that is searching for some delicious ramen on the east side of town, definitely go here!

It's set up very similar to the other ramen joints: small, with wooden tables and some bar seating.  I got seated right away and ordered the Fukumimi Ramen, which says it come with extra chasyu and nitamago.  The serving was huge and it was absolutely delicious.  The broth was heavenly and just the right amount of saltiness and porkiness.  It didn't taste heavy at all.  The noodles were also perfectly cooked.  The Chasyu was melt in your mouth tender.  The only thing that was surprising was that I only got one half of an egg since I thought the Fukumimi Ramen came with extra egg.    I also ordered the karaage chicken which I thought were just okay.  It's more like chicken breast rather than chicken wings.  Maybe I waited too long to eat them because they weren't all that crunchy on the outside and a tad bit oily.  I would say that this is right up there with Sora.

This review is sans all the geographical, technical ramen nonsense and all about the delicious food.  The Karaage is my kind of fried chicken. Lightly breaded, lightly fried, nice and moist. However, maybe it was the batch we got but it seemed under seasoned. Nothing some chili flakes (they didn't have togarashi) and sriracha can't fix but I wonder if the breading was supposed to have more spice? They gave us a frequent diner card that'll get us a free app every few bowls. Without a doubt, karaage will be my choice.  Just saying, whoever designed this menu needs a lesson in menu-writing. And I don't mean graphics! It's totally confusing! There are so many options: Fukumimi Ramen, Tan Tan Men, Shoyu, Shio, Miso, Tonkotsu, blah blah blah. I can totally appreciate options, but there isn't enough description to figure out which one to order. A well-written menu doesn't make you scratch your head; it's supposed to inspire you to eat, well, everything.  With my menu rant over with, I'm back to talking about how much I love the food. After a few questions to the waitress (who was super nice might I add), I finally decided on the Fukumimi Ramen with the Miso broth (you have a choice).  I think the Fukumimi bowl is like your  deluxe  bowl at Sora: half an egg, a couple slices of pork, a few nori, menma, green onion. Then of course you can add any extras you desire.  Broth was rich and flavorful without being too salty. They add black garlic oil at the end which adds even more depth. Noodles aren't as thick as I like but still nice and chewy. I swear, with all these ramen places opening, there are so many different types of charsiu in Vegas now. Their pork is less tender than most places and more chewy. It was also cut really thick. I'm all for delicious pork but because it didn't just melt in your mouth it was a little more difficult to eat.  Fukumimi runs a little east for me. UNLV is as far east as I usually go so I probably won't be here as much as I like. If I'm in the area though, I'm for sure going to try to stop by.

The salt tonkotsu ramen is the best dish on the menu, and you can pay a couple of dollars more for the Fukumimi ramen (which is a meatier version with sheets of nori).  The chicken karage is just as delicious, and I honestly do not know how they are able to fry the chicken so delicately and keep it ultra-juicy.  Waitstaff is always awesome and pleasant.    It's a fairly small restaurant and it can get packed pretty quickly, but the food is worth the wait.

The inside is new and clean with a modern casual decor.... I think it should be bigger cause once people try their food I imagine it'll be packed pretty often....  We ordered the small chicken curry over white rice and one taste of that yummy curry and we knew we were eating at a  I WILL BE BACK  type of restaurant....  The Chicken Karaage was so damn good!!! The breading was perfection and it was seasoned just right - accompanied by a small side of mixed greens with a yummy salad dressing - all this needed was a side of Fried Rice (which they don't have) and I would've been a happy camper!!!  Both small orders only cost $3.90 each - well worth the price if you ask me!!!  On to our Ramen - I had the  Fukumimi Ramen  which had the creamy pork based broth. On top of the soup was pork belly,bean sprouts,seasoned egg,and sea weed. The noodles were perfect - not too soft - more firm - This Ramen was delicious!!!!  The BF had the  Tantan Men Ramen  which is a Szechuan style spicy soup with a chicken/pork based creamy broth that reminded us of a curry. In the Ramen was seasoned ground meat,bok choy and red chile oil. I tried the broth and it wasn't a taste that I would ever imagine at a Ramen place - it was so freakin yummy!!!!   There are add-ins to your Ramen for a minimal fee that you can get like corn ect...  You also get a stamp card where if you buy 4 ramens on your next visit you get either free gyoza or free chicken karaage. I'm not losing that stamp card...LOL  Now on 2 past occasions we tried to eat at Monta which is supposed to be like the Holy Grail in Vegas for Ramen but on each occasion it was too packed and we gave up but I honestly can't imagine any other Ramen places tasting better than what I ate tonight.....

Ratio between ingredients and soup was 1:2.5. I found myself fishing for solids and spent twice longer trying to get myself full by drinking the soup. Extra ingredients were little pricey to add.

Despite the strip mall exterior, inside was small and cozy with bench seating and bar seating. I dined solo and was helped immediately. Staff was attentive. There is signage up advertising their limited-time summer special of cold noodles, as well as a new flavor of chicken: honey garlic, which sounded amazing but I was dining alone.  Ordered the tan tan men, for change of pace. Received a gigantic bowl of broth, bok choy, noodles, and sausage- the sausage was actually reminiscent of chorizo, full of fat and flavor and that distinctive orange tinge to the broth. The broth itself was super rich, and seems like it may have contained dairy. Noodles were chewy and thick, the way I like them. My only adjustment to this order in the future would be to add more bok choy- the three leaves in my dish simply were not enough to balance out the richness and fat in the sausage and broth. Overall flavor profile was complex, with spice from the sausage, and again, very rich.  Later, this richness caused some stomach problems for me- consider yourself warned.

Tonkotsu miso was closer to tonkotsu than a miso ramen in my opinion and it was very good, probably better than monta.   As this is more of a tonkotsu place, it should not be compared to Sora.   Chicken karaage was perfectly done with a slice if lemon, flavored salt into which you can dip the chicken and a small salad.    My only complaint is that I didn't get to taste the tan tan men and that it's on the East side far away from my house.  I would rate their tonkotsu higher than that of montas as I have noticed some inconsistencies in monta recently.

Fukumimi's broth was dense in flavor and the Chicken Chashu included in the bowl was well-spiced, flavorful and mind-blowing. Easily one of the best food experiences I've had in Vegas.

Just like at Sora, I always have the usual, the Fukumimi. It comes with all the nessescary essentials: pork, miso broth, thin noodles, nori, green onion, egg... But as an added bounus, you get their yummy black garlic oil poured on top.  I have tried the Tan Tan Men as well. I really, really think that you should order it, at least once. It's not everyone's cup of tea (right Khatherine T.? Heh heh), but when I tried it, I have to say it was a nice change of pace.  The minced pork is almost sweet, with the broth being quite even and mellow. There almost seems to be slight nutty flavor to it. It's nice to break away from the usual once in a while.  One of the awesome things about Fukumimi is their rewards card! It only takes 4 stamps to earn either a free karage chicken or gyoza on your next trip! So it really doesn't take a million trips over there to earn it, unlike some places where you have to buy 10 or 15 of something to earn some small reward.  There's not much room inside, so it can get crowded fast. Most of the time, it's not, so don't worry. They should look into serving a bigger selection of adult libations. You can only order a few beers and (I think) sake. There's such a high profit margin to be made an alcohol, I don't see the harm in trying it out.   This is a little Vegas gem.

When we finally found Fukumimi, we were a little skeptical because it didn't look like much from the outside.  It was located in a nondescript seemingly vacant strip mall.  The exterior of the restaurant boasted no more than their restaurant name and a lit  OPEN   sign, betraying what we were to soon find out their cozy, modern inside.  The decor was spartan chic in a way that only Japanese can be.  As expected, the menu was fairly limited.  Unlike other places, they offer only rice bowls...no fried rice (I do enjoy Japanese-style fried rice).  Up until this point, the aroma of the restaurant did a lot to convince me that the ramen may be legit.  But I still needed more...so I ordered the purist's favorite tonkotsu ramen.  Hubby went with the Fukumimi special which from what I can gather is just a supersized version of their regular tonkotsu ramen.  We also ordered the recommended karaage as well as a small chicken bowl.  Chicken bowl - comforting, pretty decent, well-flavored Karaage - BEST I've ever had.  Moist, lightly battered and tender...served with a mini salad and some special salt / lemon wedge Ramen - The broth was excellent.  Rich without being overwhelming and definitely well-seasoned and flavored.  The garlic oil was a great addition and the egg (of which I ordered extra) was perfectly cooked in that the yolk was jelly-like instead of yellow and chalky.  Service was nice, very friendly...though I don't know why but the ramen chefs seemed to be talking about me, somewhat disconcerting until I got distracted by the food.  (I swear, I'm not vain...but they could probably tell we were out-of-towners.  A quick scan of the cars parked outside seem to yield that everyone in the joint is from NV.)  Definitely a must-visit...the wait wasn't as ridiculous as the other highly-touted ramen place.

I had the   Fukumimi Ramen: the broth is milky, not as milky as Ippudo in NY, but still really milk of bone milky, not cream milky. The noodles are very similar to a thin egg noodle I used to get from a company called Quon Yick, but although they are similar these noodles are definitely very tasty and cooked perfectly. They are not overcooked and the color is slightly translucent but still opaque enough that you can tell they are done with care. Seaweed is the normal nori that you would find in large sheets cut up into squares. Their chashu is pork belly slow-braised and sliced thin, seasoned well and not overly salty.   You can get kaedama (another mouthful of noodles) for $1. It's not on the menu, but you can request it. It comes in a little rice bowl and is less than the amount at Monta, but Monta charges $2 for their kaedama.  I also tried their  Curry Rice Bowl: their rice bowls come in small or large. The curry was okay, but I'm not as big a fan of Japanese curry as I am of Thai or Indian curry. The ginger was somewhat special to me because I noticed they took the time to include pickled turnip which was also red. It's interesting because normally the red pickled ginger is only ginger, so it was a nice little surprise.   Their front of house staff mainly speaks Japanese, but understood enough English to take my order. The interior is mainly decorated in wood, very simple yet chic. It speaks and says, we're here for you to eat and enjoy a moment of zen. I enjoyed my moment. It's also more spacious and they don't try to turn and burn, like at some other places... eh hem.   They cleared away dishes discreetly and added water appropriately. Their service was apparent, but not brash. I also forgot my sunglasses and they chased after me to return them.

Their karaage on the other hand is a good portion size and pretty tasty (3) Service: they messed up our order but it turned out okay because we were too full anyway (2) overall: the tonkotsu ramen broth is still subpar but at least decent, toppings are okay and reasonably priced. Wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but if I was in the neighbourhood and having pregnancy-like cravings for ramen, I'd give this place another shot.(3)  Found out about this place and headed over for nice big bowl of Japanese lovin'.  We ordered a tonkotsu miso ramen ($8.20), fukumimi ramen($9.50), karaage ($3.90) and a curry bowl ($3.90).   Here is my analysis of the ramen:  The Broth: meh - not enough porky fatty goodness in the broth - on the oink scale, this would rank about a 6/10 scale - detectable but definitely not enough.  The Noodles - kudos for the actual legit tonkotsu noodles (the straight, white noodles). Mildly overdone (I prefer a little more firmness) but definitely gets some marks for this.  Miscellaneous: Chashu - it's okay - not your melt-in-your mouth goodness but decent enough. Egg - good amount of runniness - perfectly cooked. Toppings amount - decent amount given the price.  The karaage was pretty good - nice crispness without too much coating and well seasoned. Very good portion size for the price too. Overall, I think I enjoyed the karaage better than the ramen actually.  We never received our curry bowl (the server forgot to put the order in) but that was okay because we were fairly stuffed after finishing our ramen and karaage.   To me, what differentiates the true great from a decent ramen place is the broth -- and Fukumimi Ramen definitely wasn't  lickin' the bowl clean  kinda good for me. It lacked the soulful perfection from a great ramen joint. That being said, it's okay enough to fill the belly and the karaage was pretty good.

On my last visit this July in Vegas, I tried the spicy miso tonkotsu and it was hands down one of the best bowls of ramen I've ever had.

I had a hankering for. Ramen because I've got the sniffles and was in Las Vegas for work. A quick Yelp search and flat tire later, I finally found them. The guy behind the counter was gracefully trying to remove a belligerent vagrant as I entered the place. He could have been mean, as she was swearing up a storm, but he was calm and kind, which really made a good impression on me.   But vagrant relations was not the purpose of my visit, so on to the food!  I had the karaage (Japanese fried chicken bits - $3.90) and tantan men (pork, miso, and sesame paste ramen $8.95). Both were superb, and the price was right.   My craving satisfied and with no angry homeless people blocking my exit, I left a happy customer.", "Date": "2014-11-13", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Suzanne", "ReviewID": "0pJtBQ-bRG_KSNVf1FsAAg", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Honestly not a big fan of this place. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and didn't think it was particularly special or even that good. The broth has good flavor but it wasn't super thick or rich. I think the main culprit were the noodles.  It was pretty bland and didn't add much to the meal besides my carb load count. There was also very little cha Siu meat that comes with the ramen.   I haven't had a lot of ramen in vegas but I definitely don't think I'll be coming back to this one. Service was great, the place was small and cozy, but I left pretty unsatisfied with my meal.", "Date": "2016-06-27", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Sheryle", "ReviewID": "MWi0jogPmAi6EEHeX2t88A", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Small little place but the food is good! Small size but will fill you up and with a good price you can get 2. The ramen bowls are a good size for a person to get filled up on. It's the little appetizers that are small.

A hearty bowl of ramen was definitely the right call.  Hubby ordered TanTan Men.  He scoffed it down, and raved about it.  I had the Fukumimi ramen.  Really liked it, but could have cared less for the 3 large sheets of nori.  It already had seaweed oil, but I suppose it is a personal preference.  The chashu was delicious.  The bean sprouts could be cooked less, I like mine just blanched... my only real complaint.    Our table (by the entrance) was wobbly, and so was my chair.  Figured there was a slope on the concrete floor.  Hubby broke a ohashi to correct the wobbliness, so table now no longer wobbles, just on slight angle with the floor So if you happen to sit by the window table, and notice the slant, that's my hubby's 'workmanship':)     Yuki, our server, presented us with a 'stamp' card... eat 4 bowls=choice of free karaage or gyoza.   Novel idea. Per Yuki's recommendation, we will definitely to try the karaage.  She claims that it's better than KFC.   Will definitely return.  Be warned though, restaurant is narrow, and with limited seating, like Monta.  At that time, all the tables were already filled... and they had a steady stream of patrons... mostly Japanese.  Good sign. :)", "Date": "2012-11-11", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "LJ", "ReviewID": "4-qOGKvvnZ5K3TgTHCE3jQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "If you're looking for a very good new ramen place try, go to Fukumimi Ramen. I ordered the Fukumimi Ramen no joke it was the best ramen I've ever had. One sip of the broth and I was hooked. There are definitely so many amazing flavors going into it. Some suggestions I would give is to enjoy the broth before diving into the noodles, up to you though I like my noodles a little less firm they're still good. The pork belly was very delicious, let it soak into the broth you're gonna love it more. Nori pieces complemented it all. I wish I had more.  Fukumimi Ramen isn't that hard to find. It's not that far from the university, airport, strip, and a lot of business areas. It's located in a center on the NE corner of Tropicana and Eastern and just stands out with its funky Fukumimi Ramen sign and red banners in the window. It is however small inside and apparently people don't know how to park outside but there are a lot of parking.  I'm no ramen expert and haven't been to many  authentic  Japanese ramen places but Fukumimi Ramen has to be one of the better new ramen places to try. As I said it is small and new, right now is the best time to go before it gets more popular. There's probably only 5 tables and the bar area seats maybe about 5.   I've heard of their tantanmen, so you're next my list tantanmen I'm coming for you.", "Date": "2012-11-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Kristin", "ReviewID": "SL--QFRNDrD2adKV82XDMg", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Horrible service we came in when it wasn't that busy and none of the waitress offered to sit us down when they had plenty of openings.

Arriving sometime in the early afternoon, our group of 7 people were immediately seated in the back.   The waitress was very nice and the rest of the staff also seemed very friendly. However, I was less than impressed with the food.   Gyoza: So many people raved about these dumplings in the reviews, I thought it was a must try thing. In my personal opinion, the gyoza was less appetizing than the frozen pot stickers I can purchase from Costco.  Mini Chashiu Bowl: I do not think the meat that topped the rice could even be called meat...let alone pork. The rice also tasted a bit over cooked (soggy).   Ramen: The broth is good, but nothing worth travelling to. The noodles were mediocre and the only really great thing to rave about in this bowl was the soft boiled egg, and i think it's harder to mess up an egg than it is to make it delicious!   If you are really close by and there's nothing else you really want, then coming here is OK. But if you are on the fence, I would maybe try for another place. There really wasn't anything that stood out to me here.", "Date": "2016-08-04", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Garo", "ReviewID": "yGh3ZUG55zBOMRS7-lyBsg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "My first search for Ramen in LV w/ a filter of one $ led me here.

SILENCE. And lots of it.   When you're on a first date, this is probably not the first red flag that you need to run to the bathroom and call your BFF to call you back in 10 minutes with an emergency to bail you out.  Mayday! The night is going downhill stat! MAYDAY!    But if you were like me and brought a parent whose seen more than his share of bowls of ramen in his lifetime, then the silence is welcomed. It's a stamp of approval. A gold star. It means that the bowl of miso tonkotsu ramen my dad ordered and the bowl of salt tonkotsu ramen I got delivered on generous portions of noodles, aromatic broth, and some righteous slices of chashu pork.   The service is here is quick and to the point, but not brusque or overbearing at all. They didn't ask us if we knew about their punch card, so I approached them after having perused a few reviews on Yelp, and now I'm two out of four bowls of ramen away from a free side of gyoza or chicken karaage. What a great day.  Sidenote - I had to drop my dad, said Senor Silence, off at the airport after our meal and we made it with more extra time than we anticipated. So an even better day.", "Date": "2013-10-23", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
