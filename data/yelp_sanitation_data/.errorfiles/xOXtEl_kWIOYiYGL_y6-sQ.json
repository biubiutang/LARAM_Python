My co workers and I needed a nice little get together and we chose to have some frozen yogurt.    Well for me, I chose the Versailles.  It was crepe mixed with strawberry and bananas drizzled with caramel.  They also put the whip cream on the side, thank good ness they did that.  I don't like when there is too much whip cream.  But I do like it topped with ice cream.  There were about 6 different flavors but a rather large bar for toppings.  If you are an employee they will honor an employee discount.   One thing they get you with is the price.  It was about $12 for the crepe.

That's pretty embarrassing considering that Bally's is a multi-million dollar facility with gambling, bars, restaurants, a food court, sports book and hotel rooms.  Of course, Bally's is like the West Virginia of Las Vegas hotels, so when you find something food about it (like Blizz) you are thoroughly impressed.  Here's the deal with Blizz - they are open all day and late night for smoothies, Belgian waffles and frozen yogurt and the Fro Yo is self serve. So if you have sweet tooth, just hit up Blizz and grab some fat free yogurt. Then be sure to top it with like eight pounds of cookies, chocolate, sprinkles and other refined sugar, therefore negating the effect of the smoothie you had earlier.  You will enjoy this experience so much, you will return three times in one week like I did. Made for one heck of an interesting expense report.

I was here for a conference and I needed breakfast before I had to listen to talks for 8 hours. I didn't want super unhealthy food, so i figured a smoothie or parfait would be a better option. The first morning I got the blizzberry smoothie which has blackberries, blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries with slim milk and yogurt. I figured since it had so many of the berries I like, plus yogurt and milk, it would have to be delicious. The smoothie was definitely bland and not at all as tasty as it potentially could have been. Definitely expected a lot more flavor. My friend got the parfait which was just okay as the granola was stale and the yogurt wasn't really flavorful. I was disappointed overall. Also, their yogurt is 55 cents an ounce. I'm not sure if 55 an ounce is cheap.   Update: This conference was three days so I basically went here every morning because I had no other choices really. The second and third days I just stuck to the parfaits. Both of these days the parfaits were much better than the first time. The first time there was only blueberries and two raspberries, and some granola. The other times there was a lot more of the blueberries and raspberries, and then strawberries lining the cup! It was a much better parfait the last two days, but still expensive ($6+) and not the best I have had.", "Date": "2011-10-27", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Susan", "ReviewID": "gTWbGHSLPk_r1MRZZni8uA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I found this place while me and my husband were taking a walk on the strip... it started to rain so we ducked into the Mirage.

The frozen yogurt is delicious, creamy, and doesn't taste artificial. We had the chocolate and the dulce de leche flavors, which were delicious on their own and together. Along with this, they had crepes! It isn't listed on their website, though. We had a Smore's crepe along with our froyo, and the crepe was great! All the fillings and toppings were delicious and the crepe held together quite well.  The employees working here were very friendly. The only thing that I disliked had to do with sampling the froyo flavors. They require an employee to be standing out by the froyo machines with the people sampling the froyo to prevent people from refilling the sample cups and not buying anything, but it was far too busy for that. There were only two people working, and it was late night in Vegas, so there were way too many customers to only have one person making the food and running the register while the other stood out and kept an eye on the froyo samplers.   All-in-all, I loved the food here and definitely plan on coming back for a snack or dessert (and more crepes!) next time I am in Vegas. Recommended!

Blizz adds crepes and other things to the menu, but it's important to know this frozen yogurt is made offsite by a company that makes it the exact same way for any franchise owner.  The only difference is that each franchise chooses which flavors they serve.  In the frozen yogurt world there's many options, but the contenders are Pinkberry and these franchises.   Reading some posts below, I get the impression that Pberry people are snobs.   It's either Pinkberry or it isn't.     I'm not a snob with these products.  Pinkberry can run sharp and tart, where these franchises run smoother and creamier.  Both are good at what they do and there's no reason to snub Blizz for tasting less yogurty and more soft servy.  For some people that's an obvious advantage and therefore selling point.  For those below who are concerned about the price, where are you again?  Two words:  Las Vegas.  Find one of these franchises anywhere else and -- you guessed it -- the prices are cheaper.  One other thing:  you can get free samples of any flavor, and so there's zero reason for being unhappy with your flavor.  There used to be the world's oldest ice cream store where Blizz is now.

We also ordered a strawberry and banana crepe. The berry and tropical smoothies were good.  However the crepe was dry and the lady did not put enough Nutella on it. We threw out 3/4 of it. The lady making the crepes was not friendly either.", "Date": "2016-07-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Amanda", "ReviewID": "ReYi24viOT2v52JOCqxjDQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I agree with the review that said this is a blessing for breakfast in Vegas.  Especially with the smokey air make your throat hurt and lose your voice.  The workers were very helpful and altered a smoothie that was all fruit.", "Date": "2011-03-11", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Mistyday", "ReviewID": "7IwARv77x7KkUFYNsMKcIg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "If you want frozen yogurt with fruit this is your typical frozen yogurt  spot. However you can go to the blizz bar that is a sister shop. They feature piña colda,strawberry, orange crush, cola,mango etc.... Frozen drinks. Seems typical until it's time to put the double shots in of top shelf liquor. For $2 extra you can get an extra tube of liquor inside your cup. I opted for the souvenir cup that had a $8 refill charge. I even tried soaked Cherri's that were surprisingly heavily concentrated with Booz. Open until midnight everyday", "Date": "2015-12-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Alan", "ReviewID": "k7HkB-9zP_nu9PbKKKvTjg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I was walking around the hotel craving some crepes. So I walked by Blizz Frozen Yogurt. The minute you walk in you are greeted with a nice welcome. So after couple minutes at looking at the menu. I decided to order the Nutella Crepes. I have to say one of the best crepes I ever had. What stands out about Blizz Frozen Yogurt is the great selections of desert items.  If you are looking from a simple smoothie, yogurt and crepes in you will enjoy the food at Blizz Frozen Yogurt. The employees are very helpful with giving you advise on items you make like. If you are a person who just looking for a simple place to have desert without the large crowds then just must try Blizz Frozen Yogurt.   Blizz Frozen Yogurt is located to the back of the hotel before the pool entrance. No questions I will be back again to Blizz Frozen Yogurt.", "Date": "2017-01-15", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
