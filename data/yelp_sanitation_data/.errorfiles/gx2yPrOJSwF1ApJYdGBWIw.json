After driving almost 7 hours, this was our first stop.  I ordered the spicy tonkatsu ramen and my husband ordered the vegan ramen.   My ramen was so delicious, a very nice & rich flavorful broth, freaking good tonkatsu, melted in mouth, cooked perfectly. The other important part from a good ramen is the noodle. This noodle was perfect! Not mushy at all. The texture was  perfect, it had a body. It was nothing like instant packaged noodle at all.   My husband's ramen was delicious too, and again the broth & the noodle were perfect.   Price is cheap for a very delicious ramen, yeah especially if I compare with ramen in Reno that I had before, was nothing to compare about. This ramen has a very good quality, lots of broth so it was not like noodle bowl with less broth, this was the real ramen.   The place wasn't that busy that day, because we were there after lunch time. The restroom was clean & quite fancy toilet bowl with a picture on the wall wrote no ramen no life, pretty cool funny.   Maybe someday they will open in Reno, well I hope so, real ramen from Japanese people not just western style of ramen.", "Date": "2016-08-20", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Mae", "ReviewID": "khddemQ_IVdA_3i5ZO5jMA", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Great food.

Period. I honestly think it's the best ramen place in Vegas.  Getting seated here is usually very quick. Orders are taken in a timely manner. The wait for food isn't usually long. The ambiance is very chill and relaxed with dim lighting. It's great for a large group of friends or even eating alone.   I always get the Tonkatsu Black with a Jinya Bun. EVERYONE should try the Jinya Bun. It will change your life -- savory pork belly that melts in your mouth, a mayo-like sauce, with small slices of cucumbers and some greens on a fluffy white bun. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Ramen broth is not too salty. It's actually very flavorful and not too overpowering. I used to be a die-hard thick noodles kinda gal. But Jinya made me appreciate thin noodles which I now love!  And if you're not feeling like getting pork, get the chicken ramen. Much lighter feeling after eating but still very tasty.

All that changed after one of my bestest friend's birthday. She stated she wanted Ramen and I told her about college and she exclaimed,  that's not REAL ramen!  I agreed, since when was accepting a 10 cent package as the be-all, end-all of ramen? It wasn't. I was so ignorant, given my love for virtually all Asian fare (expect Korean).   JINYA has a sleek modern feel. A large table in the center is used for large parties or several small partied. It should be noted the rest of the establishment has maybe 4 seats at the bar, and the rest are booths that seat 4 comfortably. Not a place for large groups.  On my last trip I got a the Cha Cha Cha (my favorite to date!),a chicken ramen with seasoned egg, tons of herbs, and tons of garlic as well a side of fresh garlic and a garlic press. I dream about this dish. I've brought friends to taste their noodle delights and they too are hooker. I am so afraid to try Ramen elsewhere because JINYA serves up a bowl of heaven. I rarely get sick and pho is my GO-TO, but I rue the day I get down with the sickness and destroy a bowl of broth and noodly goodness. Seriously, it's next level.  I usually order a combo with a salad and/or gyoza/california roll). The salad is great and I whatever dressing they use on it, is flavorful and unlike anything I've tasted before. During a happy hour I tried a JINYA bun which was delicious (and almost as good as Fat Choy's). Oh, yes, folks, you read that correctly, JINYA has a dope happy hour (3 PM - 5PM)! Cheap drinks and all apps are reduced (although the price point here in on point).   Service is always polite and the staff seem to work in teams running food and providing refills. This place gets packed! I've seen wait times. The joint is open until 3 AM, 7 days a week! Note to self: on the off chance you get schwasted, noodle it up!  I am in SLURPY, NOODLY heaven when at JINYA, my only complaint is that the music is so damn loud in there. I've found this to be a trend in modern Asian joints.

They offer dishes to add onto your ramen like pork gyoza, Tokyo curry rice and crispy chicken. JINYA also has an additional page of tapas, rice bowls and desserts.   My waitress recommended the pork bun to start. At $3.80 it was the most expensive single pork bun I have ordered. It arrived on a small black plate with a toothpick in the center to hold it together.  It ended up being a reasonable size for the high price. The bun was fluffy and unlike most pork belly the meat was lean. It was also very tender but I thought the lettuce in the bun was unnecessary and would have done better with just the cucumber. The sauce did not pack enough punch for me so I mixed the house made ramen sauce and chili sauce to dip the rest of the bun into.   For my ramen, I decided on the chicken ramen because my waitress said it was her favorite and had just as much flavor as the pork broth without being too rich. She was right, it was the most flavorful chicken ramen broth I have had. It was rich, creamy, but the noodles were too chewy for my taste.   JINYA ramen has a much better chicken broth than any of the other ramen restaurants I have been to in town.

It's kind of mind blowing how I was dying for just one legit ramen joint in Las Vegas only a few years back and now I could do a week straight without going to the same spot.  I'd also have to chug 500 gallons of water during said week but still....  I was looking for a basic, no frills ramen and their  Tonkotsu Assari  fit that bill perfectly.  Our server also mentioned it was his favorite.  Assari consisted of pork broth, chashu, green onion, egg and bean sprouts, but the thick noodles were the clincher for me.  Most of Jinya's ramen offerings come with thin noodles which I am usually not down with although I didn't ask if they would substitute.    It's a good thing they put me at a corner table since I slurped my face off.  From top to bottom, it was solid through and through.  There is better chashu to be had in town, but this was still a nice bowl of satisfaction.  I'd also skip the salad (dressing was gross) plus gyoza add-on and opt for another tapas dish instead.    To my knowledge, Jinya is also the first and only spot in Vegas to do takoyaki the right way.  I've had so many awful versions of it since moving from Japan that I had given up hope.  I was delirious after my first bite!  The light crunch, generous chunks of octopus with its signature sauce, mayonnaise and dried bonito flakes put my taste buds on another planet.  It was a terrific dish that I will be having multiple times in the future.  Love that they're open until 3am!!

Actually, Jinya is quite a few blocks away but it is on par, dare i say better? Having consumed the Tokyo special which includes the standards by which to judge ramen: tonkatsu pork and pork broth, i think better is a consideration.  I found the pork broth to be heavy and filling in the best way. Creamy umami permeates the entire bowl and delivers satisfaction with the perfect amount of salty-ness. Speaking of perfect, i have to mention the temperature of the dish which was, perfect. The only thing worse than cold ramen is losing taste buds right out of the gate!  Add to this slightly aldente noodles and flaky, delightfully seasoned pork and you have a serious contender for Vegas' best ramen. I can't wait to return for more of the small yet exciting menu.

It just comes out in bulbs and they hand you the press and you can press it in yourself, which was nice. I don't think the ground pork added much to the ramen, however. For some reason, it didn't have a fresh taste. Maybe a little old.  Friends of ours had ordered spicy ramen with extra noodles. Their dish came out and it didn't look spicy at all (just plain yellow broth). When they asked the server if it was spicy, she wasn't sure herself. She didn't check either. She just assumed it was.

Also enjoyed the excellent service. We must have come after the rush because everyone was pepped up but not many tables were full. This is what we enjoyed:  Tonkotsu Black: buttery oily broth, thinner noodles al dente/perfect, chashu with melty slippery fat, uncut marinated boiled egg (wish it was softer yolk, but still good taste), a couple nori sheets, just the right amount of garlic oil, green onions, crunchy onions (so savory), and a tiny dallop of chili paste. This was great. Spicy crazed folks may enjoy adding the chili paste to it, which is at every table.  Tokyo Tonkotsu (Special): chunky savory broth was very good- had onion chunks, but toward the end tasted very salty, same chashu-egg-nori-green onions, and bonito flakes.

And so when they did open up, of course I had to go. My friends and I decided to give it a try one of the nights for dinner.  We started off with the organic tofu, which was made in front of you! It was pretty awesome to see. The texture of the tofu was a bit rough than what I'm used to and when I was eating it, all I could think about was how I wanted some syrup to go along with it and turn it into dessert tofu! Taste wise, nothing really special but interesting experience.  I also got a Jinya Bun to try, which was pretty much a pork belly bun. I gotta say...I've had better. It was a lot of sauce on the bun and most of the times, it covered the flavors of the pork belly and .. I didn't really like that. It was a sweet smokey type of sauce and it wasn't exactly very appealing to me.   As for the ramen, I decided to go with the spicy chicken ramen at their spiciest level. I normally go with a tonkotsu but most ramen places in Vegas make their tonkotsu broth really heavy and salty so I didn't really want to go there. Instead of their thin noodles, I decided to sub it with their thick noodles. I like my noodles al dente and most places don't cook their thin ramen noodles that way so I took the chance and went with the thick ones.   Good choices on my part. The broth was light and very good. It is not heavy, not salty, and not too spicy even though I can take really spicy things. Best of all, I didn't get tired of the taste of it. When I normally eat tonkotsu, I get tired of the flavor really fast. The noodles were perfectly al dente!   On the side note, their bathroom is very romantic. It was quite dim with some lights around the mirror and lights around their toilet. Their toilet's lid automatically comes up! Its one of those bidets -- pretty spiffy. All they really need is some soothing music in the bathroom and we could have a nice rendezvous there!   Overall, great ramen. Would definitely come again to try other things!

Good portions of accompaniments. Good combos available to make your ramen a full meal deal.   This place was relatively easy to find west of the strip using my gps. Its about 10 minutes away. Its in its own brown building thats pretty hard to miss. First time I came at 3pm and they were closed. They must close after the lunch rush and break when they want.  So I came first thing in the morning when it opened for lunch. At 1130 on a weekday there was no lineup and no crowd. Nice. We were seated at a table but snagged a booth since the place was empty. Theres probably only seating for 40 people max. And most of it is seating around a bar in the center.   The server was quite nice. They ran out of a few things that were not available which was pretty disappointing. So minus a star for not having my jinya bun when the rush wasnt even here yet! Their ramens a all look good and can be combod up to make a deal for a small price. I believe $3.50 for a gyoza. This was impressive. The value was good and every person could order what they like bc its tapas like. So no sharing! Small portions of everything is way better than a large portion of one thing.  Anyways I had the tonatsu black. No pictures bc theres like a few hundred on yelp already. Broth was rich and creamy. Noodles were al la dente. Everything was superior except for my egg. It was overcooked and completly hard boiled. This was a bit disapointing to me since its like a vital part of my ramen experience. And they utterly failed on it. Hardboiled it was not good and not consumed. Minus a star. But everything else in my soup was really good, and really fresh.  The gyoza was boring. A skip for next time as they were similar to the frozen ones you buy and make at home. Not handmade like at other ramen joints ive been too. But for $3.50 it didnt hurt the wallet at all anyways.  Oh if you get a chance check out the br. I has heated seats with one of those cool high tech japanese toilets. Sooo cool.  Service was good. I found them to be expecting a rush and apologetic if the ramen takes too long. Even when mine took less than 5 min after ordering. They seem tired of crowds and anticipating the worse at all times. Even when its slow. Ringing up my bill was a slow 8 min process at the till bc they rang my bill up on the wrong table. Theres only 3 tables seated??? How did they screw it up. It kinda seemed like they wanted to double swipe my card or something bc im obviously a tourist. It didnt happen under my watchful eye. But I felt the awkwardness there when I waiting for my bill.   Overall other than the hardboiled egg and the missing menu items...this place could easily be a five star experience. But for now its just a three. I noticed they have other locations in vancouver! Ill be going there yearly from now on.

I was really disappointed when I found out that they discontinued this product. On my last visit, I tried the crispy chicken, the dynamite, jinya bun, and the tempura brussel sprouts. I really enjoyed their crispy chicken but I had to put a lot of lemon juice because it was a little salty for my comfort. I like the jinya bun's well, bun. It was really soft. The pork inside it was basically all pork fat which I found a little disgusting. I wasn't really a big fan of their tempura. It was okay. Nothing special. Their dynamite though is probably what I'll come back for. It's very rich and I love how much seafood they put in their. Too bad it only comes with a few crackers. It would be better if they put more. That way you're not using a spoon to eat the dip like it's an entree. Customer service wasn't too bad. Got seated in a timely manner and staff was very friendly.

The ramen was cooked firm the way I like it, it had pork slices, but more sliced than normal, eggs, green onions and some of the other regular stuff you'd expect in the ramen.   I honestly felt like I could have gotten away with the tonkotsu assari which had about the same things in my ramen minus being spicy. Reason being was they have a bunch of condiments to still make your broth spicy so you could save a couple of bucks.   JINYA also offers a ton of toppings, they also have some really fresh garlic you get to mash yourself. I was not a huge fan of their takoyaki, too much batter, not enough octopus imo.

I felt out of place but soon realized I was just there to eat a bowl of ramen.   Oh.  SERVICE Casual and prompt. Based on few visits, service here can be hit or miss. On my very first visit, we were the only one there yet we waited over 40min. Our server got off his shift in a middle of serving us so he ditched our table completely. What was even better was that kitchen staff threw away our order=reason why we didn't get any of our order.   FOOD First off, Jinya Bun from their appetizer is a MUST. Fluffy bun with super tender, mouth-watering meat inside.   Tonkotsu Assari (~$9):  Assari  refers to something light/not too heavy. Broth was flavorful, albeit too salty and oily for my liking. I didn't see anything  assari  about the broth.  Noddle was thick and had a chew. One and only thing I liked about my bowl of ramen was the egg.   CONCLUSION I still like Ramen Sora all the way.

How can 2 people meet online and become close friends? ?  Yelpers have so much in common!   Back to Jinya Ramen:  There are 7 Jinya locations in California. This is the first one in Nevada. There are none in Hawaii. What does this mean?   Answer: I need to eat ramen with Twinsie at Jinya Las Vegas.  It was a bit chilly outside since it's November - a good atmosphere for a warm dish. I ordered the Pig Ears (JINYA No. 2 Chicharron) to share,  but I had difficulty eating it because it sadly had some firey hot sauce (harissa) on it.  I did enjoy a few bites of its crunchy goodness and some of the fried kale and soft tamago (egg) that accompanied it!  Mmmm!   Twinsie smartly ordered the Takoyaki...oh wow!  Pop one of those tako balls in your mouth and enjoy! !  The texture of the octopus was a  just right  chewy - not mushy nor rubbery!   I had the Tonkotsu Assari because it had THICK noodles. The other goodies included the kikurage (aka black fungus), pork chashu, & seasoned egg. YUM!!!  The variety of ingredients was fun so that I wasn't bored! Chewing on al dente noodles makes me happy!   Some readers may not like this part, but I MUST mention it because it was a  BAM  moment for me: the HEATED toilet seat in the restroom!!!  Now remember - in the beginning - that I mentioned that it was a chilly November in Las Vegas. ..I mean like in the 40s...  Yeah.  It's a rare thing to find anything heated in Hawaii. ..like a car seat.  So, I really notice and appreciate little thoughtful gestures such as this!  First of all, the restroom is very dim. I guess it's supposed to be a calming atmosphere?  Anyway. ..just sit down and relax! None of that cold,  wake up suddenly , shocking kind of feeling. ..but very gentle and soothing!

Still lacking lunch in the late afternoon, I chose to try their happy hour (3-5pm).  Upon arrival, I was promptly seated at the bar area and informed of happy hour (helpful for those who stumble in without prior awareness). I didn't need alcohol or veggies, so that eliminated most of the options. Having neglected to compare costs thoroughly beforehand, I ordered a Jinya bun ($3.00 HH, $3.80 regular) instead of the crispy chicken (5 pc, $3.00 vs. $5.80, a great deal). Luckily, the bun was very nice, with dough that wasn't too dry and tender pork that wasn't too sweet or anything of the sort. It's comparable to other pork burns that I've had.  For my main course, I chose the tonkotsu black ($10.80) this time instead of the tonkotsu assari. This one has thin noodles by default, and they seemed to be done properly this time. There are two fairly thin pieces of chashu (one with a dab of chili paste, which was odd since it's not in the photo or ingredient list), one more piece than the assari. The egg seemed fairly typical - not fully hard-boiled but not runny. A little black garlic oil, green onions, fried onions, kikurage, and two pieces of nori rounded out the bowl.  Like last time, I was confused by the broth. It did taste better than the assari broth, but it still seemed to be lacking. Halfway through, I tried adding a bit of the liquid from the bottle labeled  ramen seasoning.  The mixture of soy sauce, garlic, and other components does really round out the broth's flavor. It's almost mind-boggling that Jinya has this gimmick of basically forcing the customer to add liquid seasoning to get comparable flavors, a conceit that no other ramen restaurant that I've been to in any city has done.  At this price point for ramen, I still favor the deluxe miso at Ramen Sora at least 9 times out of 10. I think I would also prefer the kogashi ramen at Fukumimi if price and drive are eliminated as factors. However, I will say that the dessert (an option missing from other places) was a pleasant upsell at meal's end. The An-Nin Tofu ($2 HH, $3.50 normally) felt like a steal, with soft almond pudding, a little whipped cream and strawberry sauce, and fresh diced mango, kiwi and strawberries.  I still like Jinya in spite of my broth quibbles, but if it's not happy hour or late night, you'll probably only find me here again if I've overenjoyed my other local favorite ramen spots.

Then the ingredients in the soup added yet more great flavor.  And the noodles are either regular or fat, good texture too.

The place was also well-decorated too and had a nice hipster vibe to mesh with the overall atmosphere.   JINYA was generous with portions and offered a huge variety of topping options. I ordered the JINYA Tonkotsu Black with thick noodles. I enjoyed the noodles as they were perfectly cooked and chewy. The broth was decent, but unfortunately, the flavor wasn't as delicious as Monta's Black Tonkotsu version. It wasn't bad, don't get me wrong. As far as flavoring and taste goes, it's a solid 3.5-4/5. The noodles, meat and seasoned egg were a solid 5/5.  We also ordered the fried Shrimp Balls, which I highly recommend! It had just the right amount of crunch, shrimp and cream cheese that made it beyond orgasmic.  Overall, this place is a solid choice to dine for a quick bite.

First time I've heard about Jinya was in the Ramen Festival last year in Rio. The rumor was they were coming to Vegas to open. They were not my favorite in the ramen festival but it was better than the most as well. That's why I had to check it out.  Food  1.Homemade tofu- the concept is interesting. They poured the hot soy milk in front of you and after five minutes the tofu started to get firm. It comes with seasoning you can add to your tofu. I personally think it's fun to order and it doesn't taste too bad. However, homemade tofu in Raku is still my favorite.  2. Crispy chicken- it comes with 5/10/15 pieces. They are not the usual karage where the chicken nugget is bite size. I would say they are twice as big as normal karage. However, that was my favorite dish of the night. Chicken was marinated perfect, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.   3. Tonkatsu black- I was impressed that they give your a whole egg instead of half. The pork was tender and noodle was nice and chewy. The broth is not salty which is a plus for me. Tonkastu in Monta is too salty for my palate. However, I think the broth can be more flavorful. This is why I'm giving four stars.   Service was attentive and decent. Decor was hip and spacious.

Winters in Vegas get cold! But nothing a warm bowl of rich flavorful ramen can't remedy.  Came here late - probably past midnight on a very cold Saturday - and Jinya was bustling. Thankfully, the wait wasn't more than 10 minutes. Service was quick and to the point - no chitchatting and no BS. The food came quickly and did not disappoint.  Pork buns were solid. Nice piece of fatty but not too fatty, tender pork belly balanced with crisp cucumbers and a tad of lettuce, sandwiched in a fluffy soft bun and topped with just the right the right amount of japanese mayo. The pork belly itself probably could've marinated in whatever magical sauce they use for a little longer.   Now the ramen - we went for a classic tonkosu assari (with pork chashu, kikurage, green onions, soft boiled egg and bean sprouts) and a tonkotsu black (main difference being the addition of nori dried seaweed, garlic chips, fried onion and the use of thinner noodles). The broth in both were rich, alllllmost bordering on being a tad too rich to the point where I couldn't finish all of the broth (a sin in my book). The noodles were perfectly cooked. I'm not quite sure why they use two different types of noodles - a thick and a thin version. I personally prefer the thicker version, but the tonkotsu black only comes with the thin noodles. Eggs were properly soft-boiled (it drives me nuts when ramen joints don't do the egg right!). I'll definitely be coming back again, looking forward to trying some of the other ramen options - perhaps some of the other broths are not quite as rich.", "Date": "2015-12-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jamie", "ReviewID": "va0HjcSumH0PXkt1zitfxw", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Underwhelmed :-( ramen was mediocre.

Not at all!!  This has been a bookmarked place for many months since I drove by on Flamingo and read the Yelp reviews especially from Philip T, Leonel M, Candace C.  I dropped a friend at McCarran and then made it across the Strip and here in good time.  I arrived just about 6 PM and stood there like a jerk!  One of the people waiting told me to sign the sheet on a stand.  This is the way you get  in line.   The restaurant is small with about 5 seats at the bar, tables on three sides, and a large square table in the center around which there are about 20 seats for more communal dining.  Being solo, that was fine for me.  Having checked the menu in advance, I had decided not to get ramen but to concentrate on two or three of Jinya's small plates.  I ordered a Jinya bun--pork chasu with cucumber, sauce, and Jinya's kewpie mayo on a bao bun.  The sandwich was good.  I also got the smallest order--5 pieces--of crispy chicken.  What a nice breading for these chicken pieces.  Take care to let them cool a bit because the chicken is fiercely hot inside when first served.  Finally, I had asked the server if I could get a half order of takoyaki and she said they don't normally do it but she'd order it for me.  Instead of 6 pieces, I got 3 wonderfully flavored octopus rounds with a wonderful sauce.  (Thanks for the heads up, Philip!)  Rounding out the meal, I got the panna cotta for dessert.  The graham cracker squares gave a good texture to the panna cotta.  It was a good, light choice to end the meal.  When I left at about 7 PM, there was a long line.

Unities in flavor and so tasty.  The heat level was very good and it was hot even to the last bite.  The Gyoza were really good but unfortunately my daughter hoarded most of them so I only got one.      The Ramen was just what we needed.

This is probably the one thing that hasn't changed.  FOOD Tonkatsu Assari: This is one of their specials and also my usual order. Since they've opened til now, I have noticed a change in the broth. About a month or so ago I noticed that the broth has looked and tasted more like MSG. My boyfriend and I liked Jinya because the broth was lighter than Monta's. A second note is that the broth also has changed in taste. I ate here last night and my broth, as well as my friend's tasted insanely sweet. Some of my noodles were also clumped together on the side and they were a little uncooked compared to the rest of my noodles. I don't know if there is a new cook or not but the ramen I crave for at Jinya just leaves me wishing I chose another place instead.  Takoyaki: Still tastes the same, but they became smaller.  Another thing that I liked about Jinya is that they are open til late. Recently however they start to run out of half of their menu items by around 9-10pm. One night I came and they were completely out of pork broth. Last night they were out of half of their ramen. I just find it strange how this use to never happen before.

For a small location, Jinya is quite nicely decorated--it is very hip, modern and trendy. The fact that Jinya is also one of the only ramen places in Las Vegas that is open until 3 am also makes it a plus. I can definitely see this restaurant being the perfect joint for late night dates, large group gatherings and after work hang out. The service here is also very good. The food comes out fast and the servers are very attentive. Now, that being said, the quality of food itself is a completely different story.  When my boyfriend and I went to Jinya, we both tried the tonkotsu ramen. I ordered the Tonkotsu Black (pork broth, pork char siu, nori, garlic chips, thin noodles) and my boyfriend ordered the Tonkotsu Spicy (pork broth, pork char siu, bean sprouts, thick noodles). For an average of $11 per bowl, the ramen was nothing out of the ordinary that you couldn't get some where else like at Monta or Sora. The tonkotsu broth itself was one of the heaviest broth that I have ever tasted in ramen. As soon as it was in my mouth, I could taste the richness of the broth and literally feel a thick layer of butter/fat coat the top of my tongue and mouth. While I understand that ramen joints typically enhance the savory taste of the broth with ingredients such as fat and butter, however, the broth at Jinya was so rich that it made the entire dish too overwhelming to finish. It almost felt as if I was consuming pure fat, butter and oil mixed with salt.   You know you ate some serious heavy sh**t when you can still taste the fat coat your tongue and the back of your throat several hours later.   I'm normally the type of person with a very strong stomach. However, that night when I got home, I felt very sick with heartburn.  While I don't expect to walk into a ramen place coming out feeling detoxed, because let's face it-- ramen is usually an indulgence of umami and flavors.. But, I have never experienced such a heaviness feeling from other ramen places like I do from Jinya. I guess there is such a thing as too much richness-- a concept I usually don't mind. But here, I feel like it's overboard.

The last 10'times and I do mean 10 times because I have kept track, there's always something missing from our orders. If it's not the missing extra egg it's the corn or the pork or our appetizer. Not to mention once they drop off the food they never come back to check up on us to see if everything is okay or to refill my drink.  Didn't know if it's their new tablets that are messing with our order or if it's just too busy. Gave them the benefit  of the doubt but after 10 times it just must be them.  Decided not to come here for 1 month just because maybe they needed to get the hang of things.  Came in last night for a redemption to see if they will mess up my order again. They got new menus which was a nice touch so I figured they might have stepped up their service.  Sadly that was not what happened. They again forgot to bring out my appetizer and charged it to my check . Asked for them to take it off because of course I never received it. Which will make it the 11th time  they have messed up my order . Also never checked up on us to see if everything went well or if the order was complete.

I ordered my food and then discreetly slipped away to the little girl's room.  I was trying very hard not to skip or run but that's how excited I was.  I got inside and locked the door behind me and approached the glorious throne and to my surprise the lid flung open and lights and water mists beckoned me to come and sit.  I popped a squat and heard a chorus of angels as the toasty sensation enveloped my buns.     Went on Saturday 4-23-16 at 12PM for lunch.  $35.37 got us two bowls of ramen, a salad, two drinks, and a brussel sprout appetizer.   I got the tonkotsu assari ramen for $8.80 and added corn for an additional dollar.  The broth was perfect and I love the tiny bit of spice they put on the top.  I wish there was one more piece of chasu because the piece that was in there was wonderful.  My only issue (and this may be a personal preference) was that the egg was refrigerator-cold on the inside.  When the tamago is hot on the outside and cold on the inside it is so gross to me.    The baby leaf salad was a steal for $3.80 and covered in the most delicious garlicky dressing.  The fried brussel sprouts were wonderful, too!

Tempura Brussel Sprouts - Didn't care much for it, a lot of batter and pretty bland for my taste.  Fried Chicken - Big pieces of their version of chicken karage.  Very tasty and seasoned very well.  Fresh Tofu - This was a pleasant surprise, if you have some time and like tofu give this dish a try.  They actually make fresh tofu for you at the table.  Note, this is plain tofu and you have to add the ginger, scallions, fish flake, and soy sauce that they bring on the side.  It takes some time for it to form, if you're not sure when it's ready they should be able to tell you.  Black Ramen - The soup base was pretty good, not a fan of the thin noodles though.  Spicy Chicken Ramen - This was really good and I asked for the thick noodles instead of the thin.  The noodles were chewy and the soup base was yummy.  The service was good.

I would probably put it on the #3 spot in terms of best ramen spots in Las Vegas. Two things I like about this place is the inclusion of happy hour (3-5pm) and super late hours (open until 3am).  I've had the chance to try both the spicy chicken and tonkotsu varieties over here. The spicy chicken broth has some savory kick (with a choice of mild, spicy, and extra spicy). The tonkotsu broth here is rich and creamy, reminiscent of Monta. Only miss is that the pork chashu was a bit more tough than I'm accustomed to. The pork belly at other ramen spots are much more  melt in your mouth  worthy. Here's a rundown of what I've had:  -Crispy chicken (5 pcs): Nice big pieces of chicken karage. Doesn't beat what Fukumimi offers, but it does its job, especially during happy hour prices ($3). 4/5 stars. -Gyoza: Really tasty gyoza here. I wouldn't mind ording another round next time I come by. 4/5 stars. -Curry rice: Nothing really stood out with the curry here. Standard Japanese curry over rice. Not bad, but not amazing either. 3/5 stars.  -Spicy chicken ramen: Rich chicken broth filled with the usual components in a ramen bowl. I was kind of bummed that this was one menu item that didn't come with an egg. I had to add it myself ($1). I really liked it. They give a choice of mild, spicy, and extra spicy. 4/5 stars.  -Jinya Tonkotsu Ramen: Here's that rich and creamy pork broth that I love. Probably my favorite bowl of ramen here. 4.5/5 stars.  -Almond tofu dessert: A creamy almond tofu pudding complemented by kiwi, peach and strawberry fruit topping. This was much more delicious than I expected. 5/5 stars.  I definitely see myself coming back here. The vibe that this place offers is very  L.A.  It's hip, modern, and very upbeat. It's much more accommodating as a hangout/date spot than most other ramen bars out there. I like the fact that they have a happy hour, which makes things very reasonable.

Their menu offers many different broth and spice combinations to highlight all their flavors; it's not just a broth with however many sides you want to throw in.   Their tonkotsu broth is SUPER thick which shows how much fat and flavor the chefs were able to cook into the broth. My favorite variation was the tonkotsu black which is the basic broth topped with a black garlic oil and some chili paste. The tonkotsu white is a mix of tonkotsu broth and chicken broth. It's much soupier with a lighter (but still amazing) flavor. There is seriously so much to choose from, so their ramen soups can satisfy anyone's palette.   My must have is the takoyaki. It has such a creamy texture on the inside and they are generous with the octopus. Most other takoyaki that I've tried have a strong artificial ginger flavor in their sauce. This stuff tasted like the real deal! The ginger flavor here was subtle and exactly what I want when enjoying takoyaki. Instead of covering the takoyaki with Japanese mayonnaise, the balls are placed on a bed of egg salad. It was such an interesting combination. It added to the creaminess and I found myself eating every last bite of the salad.    The wait here can be long but it's well worth it! This place is good to go solo.

Before I start I have to mention the bathroom. It literally was the reason I ever decided to come here for the first time ever. And is the highlight of each and every visit. You think I'm joking?? Just come here and pay a visit to the loo. You'll get it. First thing you'll notice is how dim and zen like it is. Then as you approach toilet, the lid slowly lifts and the blue lights come on as if to say  welcome . Then some type of mist comes on and toilet is rinsing itself for a couple of seconds. When you sit down, every bit of stress and tension leaves you all because the seat is WARM.  Oh man oh man... The rest you can figure out for yourself, just know the bidet is customizable for front and back, fast or slow....  Ok now for the food, Let me start by mentioning the tonkatsu broth. The broth here is outstanding, it's complex with a depth of flavor that can only be gotten from a loooong time cooking. It was rich and soothing and not overly salty.   I ordered the tonkatsu black (ramen with black garlic oil) and added a few cloves of freshly pressed garlic. Wow. Just wow. The fresh garlic subtly changed the fragrance and taste of my ramen in a sublime way. It wasn't overpowering but definitely pronounced. In my bowl I asked for an extra egg as they are perfectly done and taste fabulous. Spicy bean sprouts and extra mushrooms went in there too. The noodles are perfectly cooked leaving just the right amount of chew and texture.   The takoyaki was perfectly executed, cooked crisp, light and fluffy with the perfect amount of octopus in each ball. They serve it on an egg salad bed (which seemed strange at first but it totally went together and seemed to even bring out the wonderful flavor of the balls) and garnished with green onion and bonito strands.   The ikezo drink was interesting- it was like a peach sparkling wine which turned jelly like after it was poured in the glass. Very different at first but it was a fun drink. I wish there were other favors though....  Service can be iffy here. Sometimes you get someone super attentive and aware while other times you get someone disconnected unaware and oblivious to customers needs.    I knew immediately during my last visit that the place had a new manager- longer hours, the music was louder, vibe was different, workers were different and they were at capacity when I came for a late lunch.

It really blows my mind how many good ones there are in like 3 street radius just west of the strip.  Jinya is a little more modern in its offerings and gives the eater more variety, from vegetable, chicken, or pork based broth, to different additions like brussel sprouts or bok choy to throw into the soup.  They also have a rather extensive menu comparatively, which I feel takes away from the authenticity but adds to the variety, making you want to come back and try other items.  The main take away for me was that I thought the noodles were fantastic and the spicy sauce (which they didn't skimp on) was great.  The broth itself was a little light considering I ordered spicy, but the extra sauce was a game changer.  The extras such as the chasu and bean sprouts were nothing extraordinary.  I did enjoy the option of brussel sprouts as I always love a good BS, but it just didn't match the cuisine.  So although tasty, I just didn't like the mix.    Wait was about 15 minutes and ordering took longer than I would have liked, but the experience was good nonetheless.  They have regular tables, a bar area, and then a communal center area.  Overall a nice meal which cost me about $12 before tax.

Twice, he held his finger up at me from a distance as if to say  just a second  while he dance and laughed with others servers 2 feet from our table. It wasn't as though he was busy with guests. So that's just annoying and uncool. You are a server, please provide service or move on. Honestly. It's not rocket science.   Asking for items to come as a first course made no difference - as everything showed up either all together or appetizers after the ramen bowls hit the table. Again, not the biggest deal - but communicate to your table if that's the case. It becomes a situation where the lack of proper service has you noticing everything that is not right.

I asked how long the wait was but the hostess had no idea. I only get an hour lunch break so I had to leave. I am not sure if they take reservations, I think it is first come first serve, so be advised.    I decided to go back a few days later and luckily there was no wait. I sat at the big family sized table right in the middle of the restaurant. This table seats at least 20 people, so if you don't mind eating in front of strangers then you are good to go.  They do have a few smaller tables that border the large table, but they were all full.   Anyways I sat down and was given a menu. I already knew what I wanted, and that was the Tonkotsu Assari. It took a good 25 minutes to come out. When it finally came out I slurped myself into a ramen oblivion. It was very good and filling. Unfortunately this type of meal has loads and loads of sodium, so it is probably best to just have occasionally. It is tempting to go everyday when the weather is cold though!

I decided to order takeout after work since I needed comfort food bc I was sick. I waited at the host desk and stood in front of Christina, the host, and looked at her and she did not greet me even after exchanging eye contact. Instead she looked at me. Me as a customer, had to make the first initiative and asked Christina if I could see a takeout menu. She handed it to me & I stood in front of her while I looked at the menu for a good 5 minutes. I then proceeded and asked her if their is a combo meal that I could order to go and she replied yes. I continue to tell her my order and she responds,  I'm sorry we are not taking any take orders at the moment because it is busy .  I responded with,  For future references, please put a sign at the front door to notify your customers that you are not accepting take out orders during busy hours  as a common courtesy and to save your customers time. I asked to speak with the shift manager for the night, Adam. I also informed Adam that at a professional standpoint put a sign at the entrance as common courtesy. He then then told me that,  THEY ARE TAKING ORDERS DURING BUSY HOURS ITS JUST THAT THERE IS A 30 MINUTE WAIT . I told Adam that I was told differently by Christina that you guys are not taking orders. He apologized for the mistake, BUT I WAS AT THE POINT OF AGGRAVATION AND NO LONGER WANTED TO CONTINUE TO BE A CUSTOMER OF JINYA BECAUSE:  1) CHRISTINA THE HOST WAS NOT FRIENDLY NOR DID SHE GREET ME 2) I SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR A TAKEOUT MENU TO ORDER TAKEOUT. INSTEAD OF NOTIFYING ME BEFOREHAND ABOUT NOT ACCEPTING TAKEOUT ORDERS, SHE HANDS ME THE MENU 3) I CONTINUE TO ASK IF TAKEOUT ORDERS COME WITH A COMBO MEAL AND SHE REPLIES  YES  & STILL FAILS TO TELL ME THEY ARE NOT ACCEPTING TAKEOUT ORDERS 4) THE TOPPING ON THE CAKE IS HOW SHE MISINFORMED ME ABOUT NO TAKEOUT ORDERS, BC ACCORDING TO THE SHIFT MANAGER ADAM, ITS A 30 MINUTE WAIT  I'm a very patient person. I know a lot about patience from being a special needs mom with a medically fragile child. So it has taught me to take things with a grain of salt. If I was notified before hand the moment I asked for a takeout menu that there will be a 30 minute wait. I would have been perfectly fine with it.

My sister and I got one of their monthly specials, the Tokyo Tonkotsu ramen. Consisted of chasu slices, tonkotsu broth, kikurage, finely diced onions, bonito flakes, & thick noodles. The broth was superb and the bonito flakes enhanced it even more adding an umami flavor. The only gripe I had was if their portion size was a bit bigger.

I like that they offer a lot more appetizers than most ramen places and you can even come in during happy hour for cheaper appetizers too! They have great Pork Buns and the Shrimp Balls are uniquely breaded, the only appetizer I can't ever get myself to try is the Fried Pork Ear.

I never had anything like this before so I cant say it was the best, but awesome choice.  The squid was hot but I found it to be cakey with some bites.  Still good just texture.  Gyoza came next.  Nothing spectacular.  Then the ramen.  By this time I was getting full.  The both is nice.  I like the chasu and the egg.  The noodles...meh it was aldente.

I had to try the pork broth this time for comparison purposes but on my next visit I'll provably be nicer to my heart and order the chicken broth instead or even the vegetable soup ramen and I hope they're as good as the pork so I can stop here more often without the guilty feeling.

Menu is rather typical for a shop specializing in tonkotsu ramen. Black tonkotsu ramen with extras being their specialty so I ordered that ($11). Food came out rather quick for being a little busy (not as quick as Monta roman when it's not busy though).  When I say the food lacked flavor, I do mean it. I've been to Monta (one of the best restaurants in Vegas, IMO), Hiromaru and Fukamimi that all do tonkotsu ramen, and each have their cravats. For Jinya, the whole bowl just lacked that strong punch of flavor you should get from tonkotsu. The chashu pork was nice, but wasn't seasoned enough and lacked flavor. The toppings were the usual deal. But the biggest let down was the soup broth just did not have a strong richness to it. In fact, I think it's thickened with corn starch to help it become thicker rather than letting the richness of the broth support it. Other than that, nothing really stood out.   Is it terrible? No. And there's many other things on the menu that people might like.   But for a ramen shop, there's a good list of better places out there like Monta, Hiromaru, Fukamimi, and Sora.

Then she briefly explained the menu and their popular items and gave us literally 1 minute to look over the menu. I get that they are going for a dim dinner feel, but we could not see what the menu had to offer. We had to pull out the flashlight on our iPhones to read the menu. She came back but obviously we weren't ready, because we couldn't even read the menu to begin with..   Finally she came back and my boyfriend and I both picked out the spicy chicken ramen. I'm kind of a picky eater so I asked what each ingredient was. When I asked about the  Tokyo Negi  she literally stood there for 30 seconds, blank stare, not knowing how to explain what it was....

My tastebuds thank you.   Jinya reawoken my love for ramen in Las Vegas. Granted, I've only had the chance to try Monta so far, I can quickly say that I preferred the (less saltier) ramen at Jinya. The broth was wonderfully delicate - It's not a condense, salty, ghastly rich and difficult to digest broth like Monta's. (But hey, if that's your thing? Just not for me.) I'm typically an advocate of strong, punch-you-in-the-face flavor, but something about that broth at Jinya kept me sipping and savoring the quality ingredients of the comforting broth.   I can understand that some may feel that the lighter at broth at Jinya is unfavorable. However, I have to argue that if you feel so inclined, you can always add dashes (or tablespoons) of the delicious bottled ramen seasoning and thick spicy sauce that is conveniently sitting on each table, in order to adjust the boldness of your ramen broth. You have control of customizing the flavor of your ramen? I'm down with that! Honestly, my boyfriend and I didn't go crazy with the table-side ramen seasoning - a few dashes will set it off just right. Enjoy savoring that broth, close your eyes if you need to. It's actually more wonderful than you can even imagine, when you take it all in with the perfect bite: some broth, a little bit of noodles, some seaweed, some corn (if you added it), some chashu, etc. and slurp away! It just hugs your tastebuds and your belly.   Here's what I recommend:  - Jinya Tonkotsu Black ($10.55) - 2 slices of pork chashu+ kickurage+ green onion+ nori dried seaweed+ soft boiled seasoned egg+ garlic chips+ garlic oil+ fried onion+ thin ramen noodles. Yeah. This is the broth I was talking about when I wrote my love story above. The thin ramen noodles were perfectly cooked, al dente. The soft boiled  seasoned egg  is ultra luscious, silky, and also cooked perfectly. All of the components in this ramen were meant to be eaten together. I truly enjoyed the delicate nuances of garlic in the broth, it was not at all pungent or artificial tasting. I also feel that the toppings I chose were perfect for this ramen-   Toppings added:  - Corn ($1) - I love corn and I love corn in ramen soups! It adds a lovely pop of texture and sweetness with each slurp of the broth. Highly recommend.  - Fresh Garlic (FREE) - They bring out a small jar of raw garlic cloves that have been soaking in water and also provide you with a metal hand garlic press. You can freshly press the garlic yourself and adjust how much garlic you want in your soup. The garlic flavor is very smooth and not aggressive, because the soaking method removes a lot of the pungent, spicy, bitterness in the plain raw garlic. It really enhanced the garlic flavor in the Tonkotsu black broth and brought the ramen to a whole notha' level. If you're are a garlic lover, I highly recommend!  - Extra Pork Chashu ($2 for 2 pieces) The chashu here is indeed buttery, but there is also a good amount of enjoyable, tender, meaty substance - unlike the flimsy fatty chashu that just disintegrates into the broth at Monta.   We also tried: - Jinya Bun ($3.80) - Daaaym! that pork belly is buu-tter-yyyy!!! That pork belly is what makes the bun unforgettable. The toppings and the sauce were on the simple/weak side, so I can't necessarily say I need to order this every time I come here. But I would definitely recommend this for first-timers to enjoy that expertly cooked, buttery pork belly.    - Takoyaki ($4.80) - Philip T. didn't joke around when he said it was one of the better versions (if not the best) takoyaki in Vegas. It came out hot, plump, juicy, and it even had cooked egg white chunks (egg salad?) in the mayo! That was totally unexpected and added such an amazing texture and unique flair to the beloved classic. Take your takoyaki ball and just run it along the plate to pick up any (and all) of the takoyaki sauce and chunky mayo sauce - sounds weird, but that's how it was meant to be eaten! The octopus inside each ball was also cooked perfectly, moist and extra tender.   Not only was all of the food we tried satisfying, I was also really diggin' the ultra sexy vibe and bossy decor here. Plus, right when we walked in, their amazing song playlist completely captured my attention. They played back-to-back-to-back jams that were right up my alley. I'll admit it - I used SoundHound the entire dinner to figure out what exactly was playing, since I needed to add it to my playlist. I can only recall 1-2 places in my entire life, where the music really set an amazing mood for dinner. I'm so happy to report that Jinya was certainly added to my list as one of those places.   I am relieved they are open late until 3 am (!!!), in Vegas it's necessary and a step above all of their competitors. They also have a ramen/ Japanese tapas drive-thru coming soon! No way?

A friend in the party ordered gyoza and that was surprisingly good. (My expectations for gyoza are usually pretty low)    Next came the Spicy Chicken Ramen with HOT spice level. It was ok, nothing too special.

I don't necessarily think Jinya beats Monta, but it's definitely on the same level as them. The gyoza may be a little more tasty though.   We've eaten at Jinya a couple of times now. The first when it was still pretty new, and my boyfriend and I both tried Tonkatsu's. I did the Tonkatsu Assari and he the Tonkatsu Black. It's weird because when I eat Ramen, I guess I don't automatically notice the difference in flavor right away, I just think they're all good. I tried mine next to my boyfriends and was able to compare. Both were delicious, so both win. We also enjoy JInya because they offer the option of making your ramen into a combo which includes  a salad and one other item (gyoza, fried chicken, cali roll, or a some kind of meat bowl) We've ordered the friend chicken and gyoza. Good deal! and the chicken is so incredibly juicy and seasoned very well. The atmosphere is really nice also; I liked the decor, but think they could have utilized the center of the room a little better, rather than throwing that oversized group table in the middle. The table is so wide that the center doesn't get any use really; instead it takes up a lot of wasted space. Which wouldn't be a problem if the food tastes horrible and people didn't come there. But seeing as the food is good, and people will visit, they will be busy. Jinya should have realized this and, instead created two tables in the space available that would have been accommodating.  Oh yeah, this is a note for you ladies. Don't forget to check out the bathroom. They have the BEST TOILET I've ever seen.

Its crazy to think that a few years equal to the number of fingers on your hand there was only a handful percentage of residents who knew ramen beyond its instant form? In current day its the hottest thing, always in the spotlight in the local magazines, like its a trend. Thankfully it'll never die out like cupcakes or cronuts.   Jinya is the NEWEST and TRENDIEST of the ramen residents, a franchise with locations in places like California and Texas. Two pages of variety include ramen that can be suited for the carnivorous cravings and vegetarians with their Vegetable Broth Ramen. Ordering in combinations ($4-5) such as gyoza and chasu bowls will get you the best bang for your fairly spendy meal. It wouldn't be trendy without the tapas available of course. The Jinya Bun ($3.80) is a pork steam bun is worth a try (once) if you like steam buns but do pass on the kaarage or crispy chicken. I assume its called Jinya Ramen BAR because they offer various brews, many delicious Japanese beers that aren't widely available. It seems pricey, but trust that the liquor store pricing is not far off, must be the importing.   So the ramen... unfortunately I am not a fan of the four that I've tried. I blame Brittany Murphy. Her awful acting in  Ramen Girl  really had me thinking about the soul and heart that true artisans put in their ramen and at Jinya I just don't feel it. I'm probably just crazy though. The Tonkotsu Black and premium white broth's both have a sour finish to me. The garlic chips have a fishy taste, but that could just be me. I enjoy the taste of the chicken broth over the pork here and am much appreciative of the variety that Jinya offers.  Maybe  Ramen Girl  was onto something, Sorry Jinya I think there's gotta be more heart and something else beyond the dim lighting, the bidets, the iPad ordering, sushi, the 350k franchise opportunity, and community seating.", "Date": "2014-09-07", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "John", "ReviewID": "vKDIbnsWzx8bB2shDaaayA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Gormet Ramen....who knew?

Most people would steer towards Monta to get their ramen fix and I don't blame them. It's a legit spot. But this time around I was near the Chinatown area and wasn't feeling the idea of having to wait so we decided to give Jinya a shot since I've heard about how good they were from a variety of different people.  Located inside an old Taco Bell restaurant, they really did a great job remodeling the exterior and interior to create a cozy and dim environment. A little bigger than the Monta in Chinatown but I think ramen spots are suppose to be intimate in size. Anyway, let's talk food.  Ordered the Crispy Spicy Tuna since the prices here were half the price than they would be on The Strip. I was curious to see if there was going to be a difference in taste due to the price cut but nope! It's just as good! Also ordered a side of gyozas (ask for them extra crispy) since I usually like to throw them inside my ramen and it balanced out really well. My boyfriend even enjoyed them plain and he's usually not a gyoza or potsticker lover.  I decided to try the Tonkatsu Black and my God it did not disappoint. I was pretty surprised by how it wasn't as salty since I'm usually gulping down my water cup after a few slurps of broth. My face usually swells up after a large sodium intake but the fact that it didn't was very impressive in my book.  Knocked down a star since there was so many servers on the floor but I still had to flag a waitress down for some basic requests. Mind you that this restaurant is small.

Jinya is located close to the hustling and bustling Vegas area with tourist and local traffic alike, just off Decatur and Flaming-O, away from the compettion on Spring Mountain.  Upon arrival, the place looked closed and includes a drive through that is not functional and uncertain if and when it will be up and running.  You will find the entrance on the Eastside of the building, trust me, it's there.  (Shouts to Downtown Cocktail Lounge's secret door)  Once we got in, it totally looked like and had the feel of a bar, only that you are taking shots of tonkotsu broth.   Actually, I took a peek at the alcohol menu and it was respectable.  Problem was the place reminded me of that  dark dining  phenomenon all over NYC cause it made me want to refund my Lasik work.  Hard to order when you can't see, just saying. Cool Victorian loop style light bulbs that were totally ineffective to say the least.  Somehow, the wifey was able to see done good friends and fellow Yelp elitists, Laurie and Derek, that did liven up the mood.   Oh yeah, weird to the wise... don't get  stuck with your dominant eating arm against the wall of you are seated in the tandem mini booth unless you want bruises.  It's tiny and requires an Orbitz baby seat to get in and out.   When it was time to order, I was saddened to learn that they were out of the tonkotsu asuri.  Not only that the shrimp toast and takoyaki was nowhere to be found as well.  So I opted for the Tokyo Tonkotsu Special, but to top it off (or lack of topping it off), Jinya was out of eggs too!  Kinda turning out yo be more like Jipya instead of Jinya!  I was slowly starting to think that the opening may have been premature.   The waitress was pleasant and from Hawaii.  She could easily tell we were too but is still subject to the same brutal scrutiny (if warranted) just line everyone else.  Oh girl just needs to expand her knowledge on the craft beer menu, but she got redemption by showing me each if the bottles and cans up close to get the real deal Holyfield.  The food came out rather quick and I gave it the broth test right off the bat and the verdict is...manslaughter, cause man did I slaughter the ish out the bowl, maybe it's because I hadn't eaten since breakfast at Rise and Shine this morning.  The flavor that stood out profoundly to me was the bonito flakes and the thick noodles was a Nice touch.  I can't Complain about the chashu though, the chicken chashu too.  I wonder if it is a stretch to say it rivals Monta's melt in yo mouth chashu?!? Not to mention we got double the chashu since they were out of everything we initially wanted.  The spicy shrimp tempura was mediocre at best, not traditional by any stretch of the imagination.  The mayo sauce, ehhhh not a fan, but the skrimpz were big but it still reminded me of buffet style and not impressive at all.  The seaweed Salad had more vegetable greens than seaweed and the pork belly bowl tasted a lot like rinsed adobo.  The wifey said the spicy chicken ramen was delicious though, you know what they say, happy wife, happy life.  What they lacked in menu items, they sure made up for in Cool Japanese craft beer and double chashu.  Some new interesting brews seen for the first time included, Yona Yona ale and Coedo Shikkoku, but went with the Suiyoubi No Neko.  No I'm not bi and yes I have a neck, but true translation is  Wednesday (humpday) Cat,  a Belgian style white that was especially good on Saturday chased down with almond pudding for dessert.

But in a good way. Like,  Yes! Visitors!  Good signs already! She immediately seated us in a table in the corner, half booth half table really.   I was very pleased with the seating arrangement if I do say so myself. The floor plan is open, the place is not big. The walls are lined with booths or tables and in the center there is a large wooden table with seating for a group of about 20.  The lighting is low, so it gives a sense of privacy despite the open room. The music is mostly tasteful indie dance and its just loud enough to drown out the conversation of others but not too loud that you can't hear your own.    Our server was a young girl who explained the menu to us and checked on us at all the appropriate times. We ordered curry rice and the octopus balls which were both AMAZING and I would/will come back for more!   I will be a tad hit of a stickler here and say the ramen was not as aesthetically pleasing as at Monta and I don't truly care for the thicker style ramen noodles but the broth was very good and had a nice full flavor.

I'm not settling when I come to Jinya, I'm simply going with a different alternative.  When ordering a bowl of ramen, you also have an option of turning it into a combo meal.  Not the french fry and Coke variety, but the ramen and gyoza variety.  Or ramen and karaage.  Ramen and chicken chashu?  Ramen and pork chashu.  If you have an appetite for more than just soup, you can add on a salad and side dish of your choice for only $4 or $5 extra.  Outside of their delicious tonkotsu broth and combo meals, the other big reason I enjoy coming here isn't even food related; it's the fact that they have a bar!

I've been trying every ramen place in Vegas for the last 10 years. Sora, Monta and Ichiza have been my favorite to date with subtle differences that make each unique and about on par with each other. However, Jinya is on another level completely. Jinya has great ramen and offers a variety of broths that are complex and delicious. Most ramen places offer half a dozen add-ons or less. Jinya has a huge add-on menu (20+ options) for the ramen. They have a decent tapas and basic sushi menu, the brussel sprout tempura is crazy tasty. And they have a legit alcohol menu that has craft beers (stone & ballast point) and even a lychee-tini and  mimosas and some nice wines and sake. The decor is like minimalist contemporary and there's always hip jams playing to create a groovy vibe. There's a small section of bar seating, about a dozen tables and one huge group table that seats about 20. I've tried the vegetable ramen, which had so many vegetables I was kinda overwhelmed in a good way. I've also had the spicy chicken ramen, which was so good I actually said while eating  goddamn this is good ramen  like 8 times while I was eating it. I hate giving gushing reviews of places I legitimately like because I don't want them to become more crowded, but Jinya is hands down the best ramen in Vegas.

I think the broth is stronger/creamier than other places, and it comes with more accoutrements inside.   The price is a little higher (I think I paid $10.50 for my bowl), but that's mostly because it came with some kind of toasted garlic, a whole hardboiled egg, seaweed, pork, and a couple other veggies.

None of us decided on where to go for lunch, so we all settled on Jinya, which was conveniently located next door (not even a 5 minute walk.) We all walk in and the place is extremely lively. Delicious aromas all around and s someone who worked in the food service nearly her entire life, I usually look for flaws in eating establishments. Couldn't find one. We all sit down and only one orders an appetizer, which was Edamame. Now I'm a cultured little lady, so I usually don't branch out from my comfort zone, but since it was offered to the rest of us to share, I decided to try one.  It was pretty good. Interesting at most.  I soon found myself unconsciously nibbling at them one by one until our food came out. I had the basic chicken ramen with nothing special added. The only other time I EVER has ramen (that wasn't in cup form) was in LA at a place called Mr. Ramen. Jinya FAR surpassed that of MR. The broth has a good, heavy feel to it and not much of a watery, soupy context. It was so delicious that I was the first one to finish eating and ended up becoming actually upset that I didn't have enough money to order another bowl. This place really ended up etching a place on my heart, so the next day, I ended up eating from there again.  The next time, I had their Tokyo Rice Curry and if you like to eat like me, their lunch size, I promise is MORE than enough. I expected one tiny little bowl for $7, but you get that and SO MUCH MORE. It was delicious like nobody's business. Needless to say, I ended up taking home leftovers.  Overall, if you're a pasta lover like me and also happen to like the Japanese cuisine, Jinya is the place to go. It's not the biggest restaurant, but for its size, it was cozy, warm and their waitstaff was very friendly.

I enjoyed having the option of thin or thick noodles, and as I prefer the thicky thick (noodles), I went with those. It was a good decision.  Chose the Tonkotsu Black ramen and the spiciness was just right, especially for this fella who cannot handle his spice well.   There are a number of items available to add-on, and if you add garlic they give you a press and you can press the garlic yourself. Pretty interactive.  I know the drive-thru may never open, but the fact that they even imagined the concept of a ramen drive-thru scores major points in my book. I'm up for the challenge if it ever does open!  Also, staying open until 3am is another bonus. I don't know about Vegas, but in Chicago I can only think of Strings in Chinatown that is open that late.  It's actually a little cheaper than places in Chicago so I wonder what the price points will be when they open one here.  In the meantime, I've found a place to fill my ramen cravings when in Vegas.

Both my husband and I are very well educated on the proper ways to obtain and A, so we were a little scared.  When we finally was seated, we automatically noticed why they have a C... The dishes weren't sparkling clean, the kitchen looked like they could use people who know how to clean kitchens correctly...When we looked out our spoons, we had to clean them more as it was not cleaned to the fullest extent.  In regards to the food.  I personally thought the takoyaki was great.  The vegetarian ramen tasted a lot better than I anticipated.  So I was excited.  But since it was so close to closing, my husband and I felt rushed to finish eating since they literally gave us our bill the moment we got our bowls.  Quite frankly, we just ate as much as we could and got out as quick as we can since we didn't want to feel like a burden.

To begin with, server didn't even check up on us after we sat on the table for about 5 minute. After that, this tall, skinny male server came in and took our orders. As we were waiting for our alcohols, I saw the table behind me getting alcohols. After seeing that, I called and asked the female server if our alcohols coming. After about 30 seconds, she served us alcohols. I assumed the male server who we ordered has already clocked out without even notifying the other servers what he got for the orders before he left. Funnily, the male server showed up in front of the pos system acting like he did everything right as a server.  Foods came out fairly late, but the worse part was that the food isn't even worth the waiting. We ordered tonkotsu spicy and cha cha cha, and both of the ramen  had overloading taste of sweetness from the soup. I didn't know ramen soup tastes sugar cube. After realizing how sweet the soup is, we didn't want taste it anymore. My gf literally ate one piece of noodle, and pierced the chopsticks on the bowl with aggression. I forced myself to finish it because I didn't want to accept the fact that the food can be this bad. Sadily, I couldn't finish them all.  If you ever crave ramen at late night like us, don't ever go to Jinya and waste your money. Just buy instant noodle from any store near you, and that will be much more satisfying and cost efficient than eating here at Jinya. We spent 30 dollars for this food and service!

We started out with iced green tea which was super refreshing and had free refills. Next up the Jinya buns. DO NOT SKIP THE BUNS!! The pork is sooo tender and the sauce is yummy. We tried the premium white tonkotsu and it didn't disappoint. The broth has more flavor then I ever expected. It was lighter in texture even though it appeared very creamy. The noodles were PERFECT in texture. I didn't use any condiments but they do have chili sauce and ramen seasoning on the table.   One thing that I think is SUPER cool is they have a kids meal. This thing contains so much food I was in disbelief. When I saw the menu I had to ask 8 we choose and item, but mope! You get everything listed/pictured! Chicken ramen with corn and spinach, chashu rice bowl with spinach, chicken karrage, fries, orange slice, a lollipop, and their tofu dessert!! All for $7!!  Since my 5 year old can't eat all that we got to try a bunch of stuff. Their karrage was amazing, it is kind of heavy on salt so if you're sensitive pass it up.   Our service was eh, at best.

(Obviously the movie pegged my appetite.. for food anyway, haha!)  Let's start off with the decor and the environment. The lighting is dim, which I didn't mind. The tables and chairs kind of bring me back to old Japan town or something. There's booth amongst the side and a HUGE table in the center - perfect for big parties  If you've ever ate at Monta Ramen then you'll notice the menu being very similar. I was recommended the spicy chicken ramen (mild) with added butter and tofu. I can handle my fair share of spiciness, but I wasn't sure how it would be here. If you rather be safe than sorry - go ahead and order a mild. They have their spicy powder available on the table for you to add to your heart's desire. The ramen was served in a huge bowl so it appeared to have larger portions than Monta Ramen (although I can't verify that). The dish was flavorful and delicious. Our friends ordered the Jinya bun that resembles a siapo (meaty, steamed bun) and creamy shrimp tempura (awesomeness on a small appetizer plate).  Now, the only reason why I rated it 4 stars was due to the fact that my side of tofu came pretty late =( The temperature heat of my noodles subsided a lot by the time I was delivered them.

I would've thought this ramen joint has always been here.  Service is definitely a top priority here.  The choices are nominal and the prices are extremely low.  The tapas have some unique clich√©s.  Such as the Truffled Brussels Sprouts Tempura. Light tempura crunch into brussels snap then the sharp taste of strong truffle oil.  The aroma of truffle is so strong it can be sensed at the next table.  Real or not I'd take any kind of black truffle flavor I can in the summer. 4/5  The sticky bun pork sliders were soo tender.  I would say the pork was cooked over night.  The bun was soft fresh and delicate.  The light sweet sauce and arugula finish it off as my favorite asian slider to date.  All so tender it made me eat it slowly. 4.5/5  Takoballs were arranged in a line of six.  Lightly golden fried with a little slice of baby octopi in them.  They are nested atop an egg salad cream.  Flavor was not too prominent but the textures were nice.  3.5/5  Crispy Chicken was only 3$ for 5 pieces during HH.  They were crispy and not dry in any way inside.  White meat and heavy portioned there was a small dash of that Japanese signature salad.  A little bit of dipping sauce (ponzu?) it was a nice filler. 3.5/5  The Tonkotsu Black is the more formal ramen here.  It has everything in it.  Seaweed, soft boiled egg, fried onions, etc. with small noodles.  Now this is the thicker broth of chicken and pork with 2 slices of tender pork medalion.  So rich and not salty at all.  I imagined turtle soup would be this thick.  This is the best bowl of ramen I've had in town & I've been to Japan.  So if I hadn't I'd say it was the best I've ever tried.. 4.5/5  For dessert we had a whipped almond custard that had chopped fruit.  Only 2$ during HH!

The location is more convenient to me than most other ramen joints.  The customer service was fine.  They are a little expensive considering the bowl leans small (they look big, but the ceramic material is just really thick and tall), and the toppings are a little stingy in portion (probably because the bowl is small).  Ramen prices in Vegas seem to be creeping up in general.  It was also odd that the  thick  noodle ramen (what I would call normal) in my husband's bowl was super small portion, while my thin noodles (the thinnest I've ever seen in ramen) were pretty generous.  I ordered tofu as a topping and it was cold, not cooked, and cooled down the ramen faster.  But it was an entire brick worth of tofu.  The fried onions are quite tasty and I enjoyed the chicken char-siu, still kinda rare.  The spicy is really not spicy (like maybe 1.5 on a scale of 5) - it did make the ramen more flavorful but also more salty, I think.  JINYA ramen was definitely saltier than average.

It was delicious at first but by the end the richness was very overpowering. The octopus was roughly chopped and inside a fried ball shell.   Gyoza was alright.

I'm not huge on ramen either, I feel they're all the same and have that same distinct creamy taste. However, with Jinya that's totally different.   First off, I love the ambience of the place it's very warm and sultry with dim lighting. The place is fairly small but was packed tonight and wasn't really a wait. The staff is very hands on and seem very inviting as well.   Now for the food, this is my brothers favorite place so he recommend me try the Tokyo Yatai since this was my first time. It was absolutely delicious, the broth was both chicken and pork and had slices of chicken in it as well. I added corn and seaweed and opted out of the bamboo shoots since I feel bamboo really overpowers the true flavor of the broth. The spicy level I chose was hot and it was the right amount of hot for my palette, it wasn't like a bland type of spice only focusing on heat content but this spicy level was more so about flavor content and that's what I like. Overall, it was great and I finished my entire bowl.  Now the negatives as to why I didn't give it five stars, not really a wide selection of beer or other drinks. They had your regular sake's and craft beers with some novelty non-alcoholic drinks like Calpico and ramune but as far as everything else goes I wish they had more non-alcoholic drink options maybe expansion of their sodas or maybe even some Thai tea? Also no free refills which caused me to spend 7 dollars alone on just drinks.   Other than that, I still would recommend this place to everyone. They're doing great.

The waitress asked if I had been there before and when I told her I hadn't, she explained the menu and reccommended her favorite dish which had chicken and pork broth. I love pork, so I ordered the tonkotsu assari. It came out immediately. The broth was actually a lot lighter than what I am used to.  I like my broth heavy and thick. There were plenty of veggies on top. At first I was scared that it'd be all veggies, but my noodles were hiding underneath the mountain of bean sprouts. The noodles were the only noodleson the menu that were thick. One of the reviews complain there was only 1 piece of chasu, but mine had 3 pieces.   My younger sister last minute wanted some ramen, so I order the spicy chicken ramen with a spice flavor of hot for her. That order actually took a little bit longer as it got more crowded.  Her noodles were thinner and the broth was more of a chicken flavor. I did like the spice level of her ramen broth. When I ordered the noodles for take out, they put the noodles in one container and the broth in another container. The garnishes are on top of the noodles. My sister just put the noodles in the broth, and it tasted wonderful. They do have a drive through coming soon, which is probably how they will package that. I wonder how the drive through is going to work as the noodles do take a while to cook...   Just a minor complaint. I like spicy as I am part Korea, but they didn't have any chili oil. Sadness.

Exterior is all black, interior is swanky and looks like a lounge. Very welcoming, very clean. Menu is fairly extensive with a few different types of ramens, a handful of sides, add-ons, tapas options, and a few desserts.  JINYA BUN is $3 (~$4 regular) on HH menu- chashu on a bao, simple, classic, flavorful, and delicious. The tempura BRUSSELS SPROUTS were crispy and fresh with a touch of truffle oil that didn't overwhelm but added an extra savory note. CRISPY RICE WITH SPICY TUNA is a favorite dish of mine: I'm not a jalapeno fan but the thin slices are the perfect complement to the tuna and rice, which is perfectly crisp and never burned. CRISPY CHICKEN is super-moist and flavorful, plated with a small salad with their fabulous dressing and a delightful dipping sauce.  RAMENS: TONKOTSU ASSARI- pork broth, chashu, karagge, green onion, seasoned egg, spicy bean sprouts, and thick noodles: delish! Broth had good depth of flavor without feeling too fatty (server described it as one of their lighter options), noodles were chewy and the egg was just slightly overcooked. [2nd visit] TOKOTSU BLACK- pork broth, pork chashu, kikurage, green onion, nori, egg, garlic chips, garlic oil, fried onion, and THIN noodles: full bodied broth, but highly preferred the thicker noodles, the thin ones are too similar to spaghetti IMO. [Millionth Visit] SPICY CHICKEN TONKOTSU: amazing noodles with a spicy broth and ground chicken. No egg. Reminiscent of a lighter version of Sora's spicy ramen bowl but without the heavy grease of Fukumimu's tan tan men.  Very pleased with food and service- so much so that I went two days in  row.

I visit my parents who live in japan regularly so I am prone to judge Japanese food pretty harshly.  Food:  The broth at Jinya is great. I ordered the Chicken ramen, which is essentially a hearty shio ramen which is exactly what I was hoping for. I also tried the soup from the Tokyo Tonkotsu Ramen, which had a strong flavor of katsuobushi (dried skipjack tuna) which made for a really nice, light taste for pork broth.   My gripe comes from the obvious lack of attention to the smaller details in creating the bowl which really took away from the great broth. The ramen itself came out lukewarm. The noodles and spinach were not drained properly which resulted in diluted soup. The noodles should have been slightly more al dente (although this is probably a preference thing).   The gyozas were good. The takoyaki came out cold in the middle.   Overall Jinya has all the flavors for a great ramen place.

The bread was soft and the octopus was a little chewy, but not so much that it was inedible.   Ramen - JINYA Tonkostu Black:  The broth was garlicky from the garlic oil, and the fried onions actually go well with the other ingredients. Though the broth was decent, I was expecting a richer, meaty flavor. Thin noodles were a pleasant change from the thicker variety. A downside about my ramen was the globs of fat from the pork chashu.   Ramen - Spicy Miso Ramen (Special of the Day): This was what my boyfriend ordered. The broth was mild and not as spicy as expected. It doesn't come with a marinated egg. To me that's like serving a burger without the fries.   RESTAURANT I was concerned that we'd have to wait for a table to open up, but 4PM on a Saturday afternoon was mellow with only several diners.

There are such super great reviews on this restaurant - my conclusion is that the selection of good ramen places in Vegas are limited and compared to all, they maybe good?  To start with, majority of the patrons (90%) are non Asian, at least at the lunch time we were there, thus my guess is that the reviews are really not the Asian standards of what a good bowl of ramen should be.  It is so great that they have a kids menu.  For $7.50, you get a small bowl of chicken ramen with corn and spinach; 2 crispy chicken, small bowl of chicken and rice, slice of orange, lollipop and a small vanilla ice cream.  I would say that was the highlight of the whole meal.  For the adults, we ordered the Tokyo ramen special, which is just the to tonkatsu (pork) soup base with skinny ramen noodles with cha siu and a soft boiled egg.  If you were to go to an authentic ramen place, they would boil the broth for each table, not just scooped out the broth from a big pot.  At this place, you know they just scooped the broth out and assemble the toppings and bring it to the table.  Out ramen came quick before our appetizers (hint).  The broth was not hot (which it should be).  Disappointed!!!  Now come the food - we ordered the Brussels sprouts tempura, it was really good because they put truffle oil in their tempura batter so it was very fragrant.  The crispy chicken was also tasty.  Authentic Tonkatsu broth should be white or close to it, it was brown so assume they add quiet a bit of soy sauce, which made the broth quiet salty.  Oh and by the way, everyone in the kitchen was non Asian.  OH AND there are no Japanese restaurant (at least not the authentic Japanese restaurant) that will charge you $1 for tea.  Tea or water supposed to be complimentary.  We are not at an American restaurant asking for a cup of tea or coffee that is on the menu.

I waited more than 5-7 min before my ramen came out and having to wait that long got me a bit irked. I had the cha cha cha pork chashu ramen. I liked the thick wavy noodles, but the noodles were broken, not long like other ramen places. Another disappointment was that the broth was very thick and tasted very rich.

The first problem is the shortage of wait staff and delayed seating of patients. We waited approximately 10 minutes for a table for 4, even though there was an empty table available the whole time we waited.  A party of 2 walked out since they were also waiting, but several 2 seat options were available the whole time they waited as well.... So efficiency and customer service definitely needs some work!  The restaurant decor is modern with wood paneling.  They also have a large family dining style table in the center, good for a large group.  One thing lacking is lunch service...I think they are missing out financially by starting their service at 3pm....   In regards to appetizer options, I would say Jinya ranks #1 of the ramen restaurants (even over Monta Chaya) for the variety of offerings.  The pork belly buns are $3.80 each or $3 during HH 3-5PM.  The pork belly is extremely tender and flavorful and the bun is nice and fluffy (pretty much like Peking duck but pork belly inside).  We also tried the truffle oil tempura brussel sprouts which were tasty but I've had better brussel sprouts (i.e. Yonaka).  The crispy chicken (comes in 5,10,15 piece orders) was extremely moist and had a nice crispy exterior, paired with a yuzu soy sauce. I would definitely order the chicken again.  I was a little disappointed when we sat down and the waiter started listing off multiple items they had run out of (i.e takoyaki, shrimp toast, assari ramen, etc).  Not really a good start with half the menu items missing or unavailable =(  I'm a takoyaki fiend, so I was very sad to hear they ran out.  The waiter informed us that the shrimp toast is being removed from the menu....not sure why, since he said it was delicious.  In terms of ramen, the following are my rankings for Vegas: 1. Kogashi ramen with thick noodles (Fukumimi) 2. Tonkatsu black with thick noodles (Jinya) 3. Tonkatsu with thick noodles (Monta)  The tonkatsu broth at Jinya has depth of flavor and the broth is very hearty.  I prefer the broth here over Monta, since Monta can often be too salty.  I ordered the tonkatsu black which has garlic oil and chips, chili paste, a whole seasoned egg, nori, kikurage (fungus), green onion, nori,  The flavor marriage of these items makes the broth stand out and I would say the broth is on par with Fukukimi's broth, albeit different.  The pork belly is not quite as fatty as Monta's,  but is flavorful and tender similar to Fukumimi's.   The one thing that leaves Jinya at #2 in my rankings, is the consistency of the noodles.  My noodles were slightly overcooked and some noodles were clumped together in a ball....  Hopefully, they work that out, since I think the consistency of the noodles is very important to the ramen experience.  A nice touch is the raw garlic that is free, they bring over a garlic press so you can have fresh pressed garlic to your hearts content.   The wait time for the ramen was about 15-20 minutes after our appetizers...they are definitely lacking the efficiency of Monta.  However, if you want to sit and chat, this is the place to go.  You never feel like they are rushing you out of the restaurant.

Broth:  Tonkotsu Black is the one to get.  It's the most savory broth in town, better than both Monta and Sora (although Sora doesn't have Tonkotsu).  The flavor isn't from the excess salt but truly savory pork.    Pork:  Perfect mix of lean and fat.  Similar to the one at Monta but slightly less fattier.  Noodle:  I usually order the thick noodle.  I wasn't impressed during my first visit because part of the noodle was clumped together...but it was perfect during my second visit.  Appetizers:  Pork belly bun is very good with generous portion of very fatty pork belly...I'm craving for it as I'm typing. Takoyaki is surprisingly good.  Good flavor and texture.  The egg salad at the bottom is also very tasty. Fried Brussel Sprouts:  Nicely breaded with good mild flavor. Fried Chicken:  Also pretty good, tender, crispy, and flavorful  Caution:  I'm not a big fan of the spicy sauce.  It's okay in moderation, but the flavor is too strong that it changes the taste of the savory broth.  I'd stay away from the Tonkatsu Spicy.  Or at least try the Tonkatsu Black first then decide for yourself.    Overall:  Every item we tried has been great.  Good Service.  Suggestions:  Please consider opening for lunch!!!

Especially if there's a wait, and there usually is.  It's also really good to eat onsite... even though the seats aren't that comfortable.   My favorite ramen is the Jinya White, which is a mix of their Pork and Chicken broth. With the two flavors, it's not too porky and the chicken adds a clearness which gives a cleaner style broth.   Thick noodle is better than thin, in my opinion.   Order Spicy and get the Hot level; it's good.   They make a good egg, so I usually add an extra.   Pork chashu is not the best I've had but it's still good.   If you're onsite, ask for fresh garlic. It adds a special kick, but it is something you and your party should partake in, or the odd one out will be the vampire target. Or get punished by garlic essence.   I also really like the combination meal where you can order a side dish. My favorites are their housemade gyoza or chicken chashu bowl. If I'm not that hungry, I ask the server to pack up the bowl so I can have for lunch the next day.   I did not like the Brussel Sprouts - it's not light tempura style at all and had too much batter.   Pork Bun - It's a good version and I would order again.

That being said, I'd skip the spicy chicken ramen. The truffled brussel sprouts are brilliant (3.5) service: prompt and helpful (4) value: a bit pricier than its counterparts, it's definitely worth a trip (4 starred review).  We were stalking Jinya on Facebook to check for its grand opening - eager to find a decent ramen joint in town. We managed to come in on the second day of opening. It was so good, we dropped by the next day with a pal to take in their happy hour specials.  First, the ambience. I think the tendency for this joint is to turn up the tunes - loud. Although their music selection is good (MJ is classic), I kind of prefer not having to shout across the table to the hubs. Luckily the manager is accomodating and turned it down a notch for the comfort of my tympanic membranes. The decor is comfortable - lots of open spaces with variable methods of seating. Bathrooms are nice and clean - the women's bathroom even sports a real Japanese toilet with heated seat, bidet, and butt dryer.  Service is prompt and friendly while our water glasses were never left unfilled.   On to the food.  In our two visits we were able to try multiple items:   Tonkotsu Black Ramen ($10.55): the broth: overall, not bad. There is some porky depth to their broth which as appealing and the flavor wasn't too muddled with other things. On a broth scale, they'd get a 3.5/5. The noodles are the thin traditional hakata style tonkotsu noodles which gets extra bonus points. These were cooked well and had a nice bite to it (4/5). The toppings: the chasu had a nice soy flavor to it, and melted in your mouth. The egg was a tad overcooked for my tastes (I like it a little more runny) but again marinated well (4/5). In terms of tonkotsu ramen, I'd say this is a 3.5/5 on a ramen scale which would put it decidedly as one of the best bowls of ramen we've had in the Las Vegas Area. I think this is first joint in Las Vegas where we'd ever finish all the broth.  Spicy Chicken Ramen ($9.55): their number two most popular ramen. The broth: although the broth had a nice thickness to it, it just didn't have enough chicken flavor. On a broth scale, it was about a 2/5. The noodles were the typical curly thicker noodles which were done well 4/5. The toppings: the chicken chasu was tough and didn't melt in your mouth like the pork chasu. Served with bean sprouts, green onion and spinach, the toppings here didn't wow me (2/5). This ramen bowl would get a 2/5 and I wouldn't recommend it.  Brussel Sprout tempura with truffle oil and salt ($5.80): this is the only time I've ever seen the hubs voluntarily gobble down brussel sprouts. The batter was crisp, light with just the right amount of salt.. When combined with the truffle oil, the flavors worked really well together. A must try item!  Tako-yaki ($4.80): served on a bed of egg salad, this rendition of tako-yaki was good with nice flavor. The filling was light without the being too gummy. It could be a bit crispier on the outside but otherwise a good decent dish with a very healthy serving size for the price.  Happy Hour Special items include Jinya bun ($3), Crispy chicken ($3/5 pcs), Jinya Quinoa Salad ($3), Edamame ($2), Marinated Spinach ($2), Baby Leaf Salad ($2), An-Nin Tofu (sweet almond tofu with fruit, $2).   Jinya bun ($3): this is a steamed bun with a slice of pork belly with some lettuce, cucumber and a drizzle of sweet soy sauce marinade. The bun was steamed perfectly and had that perfect texture. The ratio of meat/bun was good. The pork belly melts in your mouth although it was a little fatty. The time we had it, I think it was a tad sweet but otherwise the flavors and textures were very good. The buns are larger than you think. Would recommend trying this.  Crispy Chicken ($3/5 pcs): this is a very large portion size of karaage for the price. To be honest, the crispy chicken was a little on the dry side on the inside for me albeit very crisp on the outside as advertised. I'm not sure if I would order this again.  Marinated Spinach ($2): sprinkled with sesame seeds, this was dish was marinated in a sweet soy sauce. Overall, it was okay but not something I felt I needed to order again.  Baby Leaf Salad ($2): I found the dressing to be a bit watery and under seasoned - could probably use a bit more onion in the dressing to make the flavors in the daikon dressing pop. I'd probably skip on this one.  An-Nin Tofu ($2): this is almost like an almond tofu mousse in texture and incredible soft. For my tastes, it didn't have quite enough almond taste to but it was nice and light. Not a bad dessert, may order it again if we come for happy hour again.  Given that they make one of the better bowls of ramen in the Las Vegas area, I would recommend you come in for their tonkotsu ramen and the brussel sprouts tempura.

Is that still being made?  and she almost snarled in place and said  it's literally the same price as the rice, it doesn't really matter  ok but I wanted the salad. she wasn't attentive and literally would walk around the other way to avoid us asking for refills. lol. like I said I don't eat service, but I did need water :/   5/5 for ambience, I love dark room dining rooms and we sat at the ramen bar. it wasn't too crowded but it wasn't dead either, making the crowd feel very fancy casual.   5/5 for the food. I got the spicy chicken ramen which was yummy  also got a side of special ramen rice which I mixed with the soup!!! yaaaas. my boyfriend got the wonton ramen, and he's kind of picky for a chubby Dude but he loved it and was satisfied. the edmame was decent edmame not chewy and cold. the gyoza however was bleh like chewing glue with unseasoned meat. wouldn't get that again. overall tho, the main attraction ramen was good", "Date": "2016-06-04", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Juju", "ReviewID": "Q5KxwcPn0abDx6DWiIRARg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I love JINYA.

Went in for dinner, the hostess seated us promptly, and the servers were very quick to place our order and bring out our items. One was nice enough to ask if it was our first time there, which it was, so she explained the menu a bit. That was very nice. The actual restaurant is very clean, modern, and very pretty compared to hole in the wall places. The bathroom even has those super modern toilets that have seat warmers and the lid goes up on its' own lol! So cool!  We ordered the fried chicken and salmon roll for appetizers and the spicy chicken ramen and the wonton chicken ramen. The fried chicken was among the best I have ever had from anywhere. I highly recommend it! The salmon roll but was pretty standard to any sushi restaurant. The ramen noodles were thin, and explained in the menu, so that was a little different. I prefer the thicker cut noodles but no harm done. It said in the menu so you can't be surprised by it. My wonton soup tasted like any wontons. Enjoyable but won't send you off into another dimension, lol.   For 2 bowls and 2 appetizers,  the bill was about $36 so reasonable prices as well. I will definitely go back but I do feel like other ramen places might have more flavor. Or, again, maybe this is the correct way to make ramen? I feel bad commenting as I know nothing of the preparations of ramen...this is just my opinion. :-)  I did, however, end up getting pretty sick almost immediately while eating. I was on an empty stomach so I know it was the food there.

Even though the room is dark and loud music is bumping i felt comfortable in here.  Lets get to the food me and the wifey had the Jinya #1 and a order of shrimp balls.  Jinya #1- (3/5) i think when it comes to ramen i have a hard time being amazed or having it make my eyes roll back on taking a bite. im used to eating alot of different asian noodle soups. it was a creamy pork broth with egg noodles topped with pork,fried garlic and a boiled egg that wasnt cooked all the way so when you crack it you get that oozing yolk. i think the egg tasted weird though but thats just me. i think it would have been better with some wontons or bbq pork but then it wouldnt be japanese.  Shrimp Ball (3/5)- I think it was like those shrimp balls you get at dim sum with the sweet mayo but it had some fried garlic on the outside so it wasnt nothing special. they garnished it with chilli peppers but its something that i probably would order again.   The service was great and they were attentive and can actually hear what youre asking for even though that music was loud.

I come here mostly when friends want to eat here as a group or whatnot, and my boyfriend and I came here together once so he could try it out (he wasn't so much a fan) I think the inconsistency in their service is one of the main dampers to this place.. one time the server was coming around to a group of mine collecting plates and bowls that were finished and my friend next to me wasn't quite down with her ramen and instead of asking and waiting for a response, she asked,  are you finished?  while she basically grabbed the bowl but she grabbed it in a way that she placed her thumb in the inside rim of my friend's ramen bowl.. umm unsanitary and gross dude seriously.. ask and then wait before you go sticking your fingers in other people's ramen bowls.. geez lol   The ramen is solid good, but I always tend to get the chicken ramen and never really venture off to anything different unless its the appetizers options... but if i'm coming here for ramen, I always get the same ramen lol  I wanna definitely try their drive thru.. which to me is kinda mind blowing awesome that they even have a drive thru but I wonder how quick and efficient that is.. ramen in drive thru   but my boyfriend felt his broth was a bit too salty, but again a little over priced for less traditional ramen spot, wait on the weekends or rainy days are especially long and there's no real waiting area.   I do have to say the female's restroom is kick ass toilet seat! I'm assuming its from Japan, but it's definitely one of those high tech toilet/bidet combinations. but the seat is heated and it sanitizes the seat with a spray when the automatic sensor is activated to lift the seat cover. most high tech throne I've ever sat on. lol   They do have a small bar area to sit on.. only seats up to 4 guest at the bar. They have a large community table that seats about 25 people, then lining the establishments are booth sittings that fit either 2 - 6 guest depending on the booth.   They offer a lot of side add on items but each item add on is usually additional $1.00 if your ramen is $10.95 then you add poached egg, extra spinach, corn, etc etc you just added additional $3 making your Ramen $14.. idk to me it just comes out a little bit pricier than other spots I've been to.. the serving size is average; nothing large like a large bowl of pho, but its not small either. Tends to be usually be just right, but I'm a huge soup over noodles fan.. so I tend to always finish my soup first and still looking for more when I'm finishing the noodles.   Again the ambiance of the place if definitely more modern than traditional, but their menu is pretty straight to the point with not too much fusion options which makes choosing pretty simple. I do like that they have a half off certain appetizers Happy Hour 10p-12am, but I just don't like how if you order appetizers, your tapas tend to come out after the Ramen, especially if you order the Dynamite tapas. That one is actually really good and comes with 4 small toasted baguette slices to place the dynamite mixture on and its very tasty and not too creamy, like its not swimming in cream cheese which I like. but i prefer my appetizer as an appetizer before the main meal.. just saying.   Again, I have mixed feeling about this place like some days I'm into it and most I'm like ehh.. but really can't go wrong with Ramen in cold or rainy weather and this is relatively close to my house so nothing mind blowing here but solid good ramen, but not my top spot.", "Date": "2016-04-30", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Abby", "ReviewID": "tjtxDn6QjtxUbpBbeRq2-g", "Overall": "1", "Content": "I'm not sure where to begin.

It was not too busy when we went in the afternoon, and the place was quite big.  We started with some Fresh Tofu and it took a while to prepare, but it was totally worth it, since it came out quite awesome from tofu liquid and turned into solid within seconds, and you can customize the flavor you want with different amount of toppings and sauce.  The Dynamite was ok, a little too heavy on the Americanized flavors for my taste.  The Jinya Black Ramen was surprisingly delicious, it had a nice balance with the broth, meat was tender, noodles were cooked al dente, and egg was perfect soft boiled, not quite an onsen tamago.  We ended our meal with some Green Tea Mochis that were just regular mocha, and the Tofu Almond Dessert, which was very nice and refreshing.

We got there a few minutes before opening so were seated promptly when they finally opened for business.  The menu and taste was reminiscent of Ippudo (of NY and Japan fame).  They had the pork belly bun which was actually pretty tasty.  We also ordered the tempura Brussels sprouts that was highly recommended - those didn't disappoint.  And since I'm a sucker for fresh tofu, we ordered the homemade tofu, done tableside.  What a gimmick.  But ya know...? The tofu was actually really great!  If you let it sit, it becomes silky, like the Chinese sweet tofu custard dessert.  They give you a sauce and the usual ginger, green onion and added a touch of yuzu kosho (which I love).  They also instruct you to stir it up which I wasn't a huge fan of doing but in the end, it turned out fine.  You were just eating like a porridge made with tofu.  In terms of noodles, brother and I ordered the tonkotsu black.  He added corn.  I got it  as is .  When our orders came, mine had a small dollop of spicy in the middle and corn while his was missing the egg that comes with the tonkotsu black.  We had to show him a picture of our noodles (we're food picture takers) but he still looked at my egg suspiciously, as if we were trying to steal an extra egg.  The taste was ok...it didn't blow me away....it just didn't have the richness of Month's broth or the complexity that other places had.  The noodles were nice and hard and the eggs were just on the verge on being overcooked (still miles better than those places that give up and cook it all the way.).    Hubby ordered the tonkotsu assari which, was promised, was lighter.  I think he regretted that choice.    My combo chasu bowl was a little underflavored and dry.  Not enough sauce in the rice to season it.  The combo chicken karaage was good though they serve it to you in giant pieces.

Friends from LA had been telling us about Robata Jinya opening its sister restaurant here in Vegas...and thanks to foodie friend on IG, we saw that it finally opened.  The roomie immediately  dragged  me here specifically for their shrimp toast as Robata's shrimp toast is his ultimate fave food. I, on the otherhand, was looking forward to trying their ramen (it is a ramen bar, afterall).  Got here around 10pm, and it was fairly slow with half the place filled. Nice d√©cor with a large table in the middle; perfect for larger parties. You could tell that it just opened as there was still decorators tape on the mirrors and walls.  Sat down and was gladly seated by the waitress and she was very informative on the menu and what they're known for. Roomie immediately ordered the shrimp toast but, it was sadly sold out --- lemme tell you that the roomie was like,  ohkaaay, lets leave!  lol  We settled on fried chicken, shrimp balls, truffle fries, veggie ramen, and two combo orders of the #1 tonkatsu black ramen with charshu and Tokyo curry bowls.  Fried chicken - Nice batter on the chicken, juicy, and VERY good with or without it's ponzu dipping sauce.  Shrimp balls - First thought when biting into this deliciously crunchy cream cheese filled morsel: it tastes like shrimp chips!!!!! All you/us Asians know about shrimp chips! YUM =)  Truffle fries - Can never go wrong with anything truffle but, I just couldn't get enough of the truffle ketchup =)))))))  Tonkatsu black ramen - My new favorite as the  thin  noodles were al dente and just to my liking. Broth wasn't salty at all which is extra to my liking cuz I'm not into salty/miso flavors. Broth was, also, light and not too heavy which made it easier to finish the whole bowl. The mushrooms and garlic chips added the extra crunch which is always delicious. Sadly, they were out of egg so didn't add egg to these ramens; but, added extra charshu instead -- I ain't mad at that. I really liked the charshu in the ramen yet, the charchu bowl was very whatever. Their Tokyo curry rice was sweet and I don't like sweet curry. I was hoping for a more spicier version. (((((so, on that aspect - no one is touching Ramen Sora's curry and charshu bowls!)))))  Veggie ramen - Roomie found it but, thought there was tooo much veggies in there and the broth was rather bland.    Overall, a new favorite and I'd gladly come here again and, hopefully, soon!

There are about 10 different ramen to choose from, you can also turn it into a combo which includes a salad + your choice (either gyoza, chasu bowl, curry rice, california roll, crispy chicken.)

The Jinya bun was a great start to the meal!  The Chasu Pork had the melt in yo mouth consistency and the gooeyness from the barbecue sauce went perfectly together.

However it was a bit pricy and I thought it was a bit steep to pay over $20 for a bowl of ramen and a plate of crispy chicken that really wasn't all that great. But, I know better next time. Stick with the authentic dishes! :D Also, side note. When I reordered for the jinya, I didn't get my food until everyone in my party was completely done eating. (It sucks being the last person still eating, and eating a full bowl of ramen!) And, every other random guest in the place, even the ones that came in, sat down, AND ordered after me, got their food before I did. Literally, every single guest was served before I was.... That was a HUGE let down. I'm not one to pester the servers but unfortunately, I had to do just that to make sure they knew I had been waiting far past a reasonable time.", "Date": "2015-09-18", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Nicholas John", "ReviewID": "asbVNmvV4wSCGNBryqt0fA", "Overall": "3", "Content": "4/5 stars for food 1/5 for service.

It's open late so it'll scratch your itch for a late ramen run. The place isn't huge so do expect to wait a bit, especially if you're Asian and it's late at night because every other Asian is trying to do the same thing as you.  I personally like garlicky things, so I do recommend the Cha Cha one. I also personally think this branch looks cooler than the one in Los Angeles (if anyone cares about that).", "Date": "2015-09-25", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Kristyn", "ReviewID": "RLy2dYVvn7o5l3-LoldgfA", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Came here last night after a party at McFaddens. One star deducted because as soon as I walked in with my fiance, the hostess was too busy socializing with another employee. When she was finally done talking, she made it seem like her tickets were a priority and didn't even acknowledge nor greet us. Another star deducted, which I hope won't happen the next time we visit, is that our server (who was very enthusiastic and super friendly) was not attentive to us as soon as he brought our food. We didn't see him after that. We got the check from the busperson and even that took a while because there was only one server and one busperson.  Other than that, the food is awesome! I ordered the Takoyaki and Cha Cha Cha (with tofu and nori seaweed, which was put on a separate plate). I'm a huge fan of takoyaki and it's hard to find a place that has it but I'm glad I found this spot! I'll be ordering this every time I visit. The cha cha cha was really good as well but I don't know why I expected the tofu to be cooked like Agedashi tofu. The broth was super, the thick ramen noodles were super, and the portions are pretty generous.  My fiance ordered the Pork Chashu Bowl and Salmon Tacos. He obviously liked it since he wiped his bowl and plate clean. Overall, this place is a great late-night option and I'm willing to try this place out again especially since I love the Takoyaki here.", "Date": "2016-10-10", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Sonya", "ReviewID": "1Sik0R-Pn3J5XO2vZFvotA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Cool spot, great food, good music and people.

My friends spoke highly of Jinya, so that's where I decided to go. I waited about 20-30 minutes for a table for 2 on Sunday at around 1pm.   I went with my friends recommendation and ordered the Sprouting Up Ramen. However, I made the mistake of replacing the pork chashu with pork soboro. The pork soboro is really well seasoned and would taste great with rice because it's on the salty end. However, adding the soboro to an already salty ramen made my broth extremely salty. The brussel sprouts were unique and cooked well, but I think I'm definitely more of a tradition ramen fan.   We also ordered the takoyaki, which was well worth the $6. The appetizer comes with 6 octopus balls on a bed of crushed hard boiled eggs covered with japanese mayo, sauce, green onions, and bonito flakes. The takoyaki was delicious and I would come back to Jinya just to eat them again.", "Date": "2017-01-04", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Mirela", "ReviewID": "YEOv5PJZF4GDGWmxHN-7rQ", "Overall": "3", "Content": "BADDDD BADDDD to go experienced!!!!!!!!!

The interior looked much nicer than I expected before I entered the restaurant. There is a small ramen bar in front of the kitchen and a small Japanese themed dining area. The staff were all very friendly and the restaurant appeared to be very clean.  The food and the service was better than average. I would definitely recommend giving this place a go.  Takoyaki - this was excellent. If you like the Japanese dish Okino Miyaki then you will like this dish. It is basically the same ingredients and then it is shaped in to bite size portions.  Crispy Rice with spicy tuna - this is just what it says it is. It was good.  Crispy Chicken with ponzu sauce - This would have been a good choice if the chicken would not have been so greasy. I think the oil in the fryer needed to be changed or they dropped the chicken back in the fryer after it was cooked.  Spicy chicken ramen noodle - the ramen was excellent. I ordered it  Hot . It had a lot of heat to it, but not so much heat that you could not enjoy it.

There was no wait as it was mid day so got sat right away and greeted by server. We ordered our ramen and my friend had asked for extra noodles and we got the edamame to start. That was good , pretty much same garlic edamame you get everywhere . But the ramen came out and had ONLY 2 skinny pieces of pork for the whole bowl. Very thin and short pieces which I tried to conserve for the whole time I was eating . My friend's noodles came out about 5 minutes on a side plate... which we thought was kinda odd and we assume would have already been inside the bowl. The seasonings they provided were pretty good but I had to keep adjusting to get the right flavor I was looking for . Got some sake and Sapporo too to go along . But pretty bland broth with not too much flavor , maybe I'll give another try and order different bowl.", "Date": "2016-12-16", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Byron", "ReviewID": "ktud7VmP4Hbj2T_5q8kbiA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Man it takes a lot to get lazy me to write a review and this place was a lot.
