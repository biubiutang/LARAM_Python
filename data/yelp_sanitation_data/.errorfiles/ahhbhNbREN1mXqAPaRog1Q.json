There are a lot of collectibles in locked cases and the best part, the huge wall of Funko Pop vinyl figures! These are adorable vinyl figures of popular television, movie, and real life characters that have been shrunk down and paired with disproportionally large heads. Prior to The Toy Box, I would purchase these vinyl figures on Amazon (if available). Although most of the prices are higher compared to Amazon, it's nice to see them in person and there are many figures that are hard to find online. They seem to range in price depending on their popularity, but they start around $10.

I was in the mall with my son and daughter and popped in to let my son choose a toy. He likes those Crazy Aaron putties and found one that he didn't yet have. I paid for it walked out the store and around the corner and sat on a bench to look for something in my purse and my son took the putty out of the bag to look at his new purchase. It looked like the box had been previously opened. This putty comes with a black light which wasn't working. On closer inspection I noticed the tin was dented on the top and bottom. Obviously the tin had been opened and someone had played with it. I walked right back into the store and asked to exchange it for an unopened putty. The girl refused saying they can't exchange open items. This was literally 5 minutes later. I argued that I had not opened the toy, showed her the dents in the tin and that the black light did not work. She would not budge. 21 bucks down the toilet. She had to know we didn't open the tin, drop it a few times, and burn out the black light in less than 5 minutes. Call your manager. Take my number. Don't give me a flat  no ! I am now a costumer that will go somewhere else when I need stocking stuffers.  I am updating my review and rating because the store owner got in touch with me via Yelp and asked me to come back and he would exchange the putty.  Thank you!! I really like this shop and will return. I do not wish for the young lady to get in trouble, she just needs some common sense.", "Date": "2016-08-18", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "2vXR0qWs8JAUG0G8fO780w", "Overall": "4", "Content": "THIS IS A VERY COOL STORE!!!  We wanted some place with a different variety for my little girl's 5th birthday.  This place had a huge selection for all ages (including the vast selection of collectibles for adult super geeks).  I felt the prices were reasonable for a specialty store and the selection way better than your average Target toy section for the age group we were shopping for.  Tons of cool games and plush toys too.  It definitely feel like this store is quickly outgrowing its space.  Much of it felt disorganized and packed in.  I hope they find the bigger space and add to their great selection.  Toy stores like this are sorely missed among the landscape of homogenous big box stores that clutter the world.

Geeky cool.  In a small space, this place contains more than you'd imagine it could.  There's an assortment of lots of the popular toys and games in there, some cheaper things, and some fairly high-end toys and collectibles.  It's easy to go in and get lost browsing for longer than you intended your visit to last.   Games:  the selection of board games is incredible.  Most of the popular ones are there, many contemporary games and variations on older originals, but also some of the old standards.  There are also bunches of card games.  If you already have all the games you want, there's a good chance you'll find expansion packs for them here.  Figures:  It seems they have every POP figure in stock.  There's literally a whole wall of them!  Across from that wall, the other side of the isle is a cool assortment of less expensive figures from a decent variety of movies and video games.  In the back corner of the store you'll find a case with high-end collectible figures from various comic books, TV shows and movies.  Along that same back wall, but closer to the register, there are also more high-end figures sandwiched between the POPs and a decent assortment of LEGO sets.  There are quite a few figures in the store that we only see online.  Probably too custom or niche for the larger toy stores to carry, but Toy Box seems to have them.  Ships:  If you're a fan of classic Science Fiction, there are a reasonable number of ships (and other prop replicas) available.  Look on top of the shelves in the middle of the store or you might miss them though.  Stuffed Animals:  they have them.  If you have a child who can't resist them, you've been warned.  Other novelties:  there are cases and shelves with all sorts of inexpensive toy figurines and characters, coffee mugs, toy swords and other implements from all current kid's shows.  Because this isn't your gigantic toy store, be ready to pay a little more for many of the items you come across, but remember, there's quite a bit in here that you won't find readily available at other toy stores.  If you want to put your eyes and hands on some of these gems rather than depending on images posted on your favorite Internet shopping site, you need to swing by.  Now it's time for you to go in and browse.  Just give yourself more time than you think you'll spend there, be prepared to walk out with something you didn't intend to buy, then walk next door to CREAM and continue reliving your childhood with a hand-made ice cream sandwich!  One recommendation:  Toy Box, please set up customer WiFi.  The cellular coverage seems to go from barely there to nonexistent once you walk through the door.  I, for one, would be a happier customer when I have the ability to text pics of the cool stuff I see to my geek friends without waiting until I leave the store.", "Date": "2015-10-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Michaelangelo", "ReviewID": "2H0KP7X9bgchmo3l0fF-UQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "-Awesome pop collection.

As a Funko Pop! collector, most pops that have a sticker on the plastic portion of the box are difficult to remove and they leave marks on the box. This does not including stickers that state exclusive on them. If you buy pops from this place, you're either desperate or don't know where to get pops for a cheaper price. Also, I do check here frequently on their posters and when I do check on them, it's like they never restock them. When you go through the other aisles they are really unorganized. There will be damaged products all the way at front, and the good products are under an entire stack of other toys. It's like playing Jenga except you always knock the tower down.  PROS: Although their pops are overpriced, they do have a great collection on their wall. If I do need a Pop! I know exactly where to find it. Surprisingly their collection is pretty organized too. All disney pops are grouped together, DC universe pops are together etc. Another pro about this store is their displays.

Even better is that this store offers a 15% off check-in offer!   Besides the trendy toy selection for kiddos, there was also an abundance of really cool collectibles and board games at The Toy Box. The Arnold Schwarzenegger and Predator action figures locked away in the glass cabinets were nifty, but packed a punch with the price tag of $200+.
