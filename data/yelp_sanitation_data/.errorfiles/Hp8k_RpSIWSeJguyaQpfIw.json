I always sample a few of the flavors when I visit, which change daily (some of the day's flavors can be seen on their Instagram; they post daily), but we usually end up going with an 8 oz of fior di latte and Thai tea-- can't go wrong with these delicious flavors.

Desyree was super sweet, offering us samples of her favorites and letting us try whatever else we wanted. I tried the flavor of the day which was raspberry kit kit, as well as pear gorgonzola, rose petal and chai latte. All were very good and of course I couldn't make up my mind. I ended up choosing the second smallest cup size, with half pear gorgonzola and the other half pistachio baklava. Both were very good, but after a while the gorgonzola was a little too cheesy-tasting for me. The pistachio baklava had subtle pistachio flavor but plenty of crunchy, sweet baklava mixed throughout. I really enjoyed both flavors, and I plan to come here often and try as many different flavors as I can.", "Date": "2015-08-27", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Janelle", "ReviewID": "7h3q08dMggkxg7dol8JrVg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I kept seeing Gelatology pop up on my friends' social media accounts and knew when I came to Vegas to visit, I needed to visit this gelato shop, Absolutely no regrets. A visit to Gelatology is the perfect way to combat the Vegas heat while also giving you the chance to indulge in the creamy delight of the sweet and savory gelato served here.  What I love the most about Gelatology has to be the superb customer service. The employee who served us was familiar with my friends (who are guilty as charged, regulars) and super patient & willing to let you try as many, if not all, the flavors you wanted before deciding on the scoops you were going to get. This is really important to me because if I'm going to shell out the dolla dolla bills I want to know that I'm getting what I want.  And since you're able to test the waters and try out all the flavors they have to offer without the guilt trip you really can't go wrong with whatever you choose whether it be something sweet, savory, or super fruity!   I also really love that the flavors here are consistently changing. While some flavors are reoccurring, you'll always be sure to find something new next time you come in.

I wish I could give it 10 stars instead of 5.  I had heard so much about this place, even when it had a different name and a different location. So when I checked my Yelp bookmarks and saw that this place was really close to where I was having dinner, I forced my out of town guests to have dessert with me here.   When we walked in, we were greeted by Desyree herself. She immediately engaged us in conversation and then started explaining her products. The passion and love that she has for this business and her creations is very apparent.   Anytime I ever go to a place that allows you to have samples, I am a little shy about asking for too many. This was not the case as Desyree pointed out the ones to try and handed us a little sample without us even asking for it. She discussed some of the ingredients in the flavors and it really helped me to choose what flavor I was going to order.  I eventually settled on the apple and rhubarb pie flavor as it reminded me of desserts my mom likes to make. My brother didn't order anything because he was too full from eating half of my bimbibap on top of his own dinner. So I was sure to get him homemade marshmallow  treats for his flight. He got the nutella and the original marshmallows and he reported via text the next day that he loved them.   Such a great vibe, unique flavors, fresh ingredients, amazing service.

We tried the apple fritter (which tasted exactly like an apple fritter), the fruit loop (which had fruit loops mixed in and was also delicious but a little on the sweet side for me) I also just tasted the vegan chocolate because it looked amazing and it was spot on for chocolate and hard to believe it was vegan.

The quality was average in comparison to other gelato shops across the country. The cookies and/or pastries are overpriced and the cookie quality is  average.  We paid approximately $8 and some change for a small bag of 3 or 4 argentina cookies. The price of the bag of cookies was written upon the counter ,but was not legible.

Intrigued by stories of her inspiration, the light Licorice infused Gingerbread Toffee so awash in spicy aromatics that it makes both seasonal Frosted Houses and Cookie Men pale in comparison, even better bites were found in the Maria Cookie with Peppermint and Whoppers based on a confection found in Southern California while the Cinnamon Tres Leches with Honey Comb came not from my brain, but from a Cake that still stands out as my favorite dessert of the 2016 from Super Chunk in Scottsdale.

It's my Cheers. Desyreé Alberganti is a phenom when it comes to gelato. She and her team create the most inventive and inspired flavors at this dessert spot. Customers are made to feel welcome and taken care of. It's amazing how encouraging they are to get eaters out of their comfort zone by just offering up free tastes. I've had flavors that included Roasted Red Bell Pepper, Fois Gras, Chili Popcorn, Gorgonzola, and many more that I would have never even thought of in dessert period, let alone in gelato. It's such a treat to have this place in our valley.   I think prices are very reasonable considering the high quality of the product. I'm sure the price point is such so that visitors like me really can try out different combinations that maybe we normally wouldn't. Gelatology also has long hours ideal for a post-dinner meetup.

I now know that I should check out their IG gelatologylv before heading over. I absolutely love their ube kit Kat, Nutella rocky road, PANDAN kit Kat and Thai tea.   The owner is super generous with her portions and actually mixes the toppings with the gelato before scooping whereas her workers just scoop away and I sometimes end up with none of the yummy topping garnishes she puts on her gelato.   Get the cone, you won't regret it. You can put two flavors in a cone :) I'm really glad I gave gelatology another chance. Some flavors are ehhh but some are out of this world amazing! Oh, and service is ALWAYS great no matter how busy they are.   Old review:  Gelatology is a far drive from where I live. I read reviews about how art of flavors used to be owned by the owner who opened this shop so wanted to try it.  Service was great, we basically tried almost every single flavor. Soursop sorbeto had a VERY subtle soursop taste which was disappointing. I felt like a lot of the flavors had such light subtle flavors that were just so so. My favorite was the wildberry & lavender and green tea kit Kat. The green tea flavor isn't very strong though. I didn't try the coffee and rocky road thinking they'd be like every other place... And thinking that they were safe choices, I chose those two. Coffee was VERY watered down, I've never had a bad experience with any coffee flavored gelato or ice cream... Until now. The rocky road wasn't the usually chocolate, I made a mistake and thought it was! Turns out it was made with bananas. It wasn't bad though.  My friend got a large container ($8.50?) of tobacco to go. That flavor was actually pretty good! I'm not sure what's in it though... She also got the lemon pound cake and the wildberry&lavender to enjoy in the store. I tried the lemons pound cake and it was like chunks of pound cake & gelato with very subtle hints of lemon. It was good!   I was disappointed with my flavors but my friend enjoyed hers.

My boyfriend ordered a cookies and cream whoopie pie which was also out of this world.  I really liked that when my boyfriend was trying to select which whoopie pie to order, someone described each flavor option to him. I believe it was the owner who did, and it was wonderful to see how much the staff care so much about their product.   The prices were also very fair. We paid $13.00 for both and without looking at the prices on the menu would've thought that our total could've been at least $16.00 because of the quality of their products and because it's all made in house.   I highly recommend this place. I also highly suggest that you look up their Instagram prior to entering to get an idea as to what flavors are available.

Flavors like dark cherry, creme brulee, salted caramel, lemon meringue pie, and the incredible pear and gorganzola cheese gelato.    They were all amazing.  I ended up getting the 6 oz creme brulee, and only ate half of it.  She really packs a lot of gelato into that little cup!!!    She has her savory flavors on Fridays and Saturdays, so I have EVERY intention of stopping by either tonight or tomorrow for a little taste!

After the tragic break up 6 months ago, I was lost and my heart ached for amazing gelato. Fortunately,  perfect timing  was on my side and that void was filled. Somehow, I fell into the arms of a yummy Aussie...  While I love the kit kat creations, the passion fruit kit kat gelato was good, but lacked in the wafer-y goodness. Only some spoonfuls were loaded with flavor and most others were a bit blah. Next visit, I try the creme brulee and same thing happens. I feel that the mixing could be better.

Who needs slot machines?  I hit the jackpot, you guys! ;)  First impressions - location is great!  It's sharing a center with a grocery store and a couple of restaurants, so parking is a breeze.  Everything looks upgraded from the signage to the chef's coat.  The interior looks so vibrant and fresh!  Anyway, that's enough about the building/decor, let's talk about some delicious gelato!  The same amazing gelato in a different shell.  We tasted several different flavors: Rosemary Creme Brulee, Lemon Pound Cake (omg), Cookies and Cream, Pistachio, Bread Pudding, and Green Tea Kit Kat.  Every gelato is a perfect embodiment of the flavor it's inspired from.  It's literally like eating a better version of what it's based on.  Now onto Queen Desy!  I wish I could just steal her and bring her to Los Angeles--but I'll just keep dreaming.  It's so refreshing to meet someone who's so passionate about their craft, and it shows in each and every bite.  Truly one of the sweetest people I have ever met.  It's always a pleasure visiting and having a chat with her. :)  I can't wait to visit Vegas again to delve deeper into the menu.

The texture is smooth, rich and creamy. Additionally, what I really appreciate is how the workers are friendly and have no problem letting you try multiple samples.   While their flavors are always rotating, here are some flavors I tried & highly recommend:  1. Matcha & Oreo - this flavor combines two of my favorite things  2. Tiramisu - light and sweet 3. Strawberry Shortcake - i'm not normally a fan of strawberry ice cream, but this one is an exception  4. Turon - features tropical flavors like jackfruit that results in a perfect balance of fruity and sweet. A perfect summer flavor!   Honestly, you can't go wrong here.

My boyfriend and I had just finished a delicious and filling meal at Island Flavor when we decided to go to Serenade for tea. Both of us knew that Gelatology had opened recently, and we made the fateful decision to take a gander at the new shop. We tried so hard to keep a distance from the dazzling displays of baked goods and gelato. We really did. But then, the woman behind the display coaxed us not to be shy and reeled us in with free samples. Before we could even protest, she teased us with a sample each ... followed by 3 more samples each! By then, we had no choice but to cave to the sweet woman and order a single scoop of gelato. We usually go all out and get 3-4 scoops in a go. But we truly were still so full from the amazingness that is Island Flavor, so we settled on 1 lonely scoop of oatmeal cranberry walnut or something to similar effect. The ice cream was definitely very tasty. I'm guessing I'd like it more if I wasn't as full. Flavorwise, I think my favorite ice cream in Vegas is still 346 Patisserie, but 1) I plan on trying more gelato at Gelatology, and 2) I also intend to get the baked goods at some point.

From start to finish it was seamless, I was open to suggestions on customizing my gift basket and they gave an array of options to choose from to substitute items from the base basket. I especially liked how you can choose Nutella or fruit for the panettone filling! I chose fruit since it seemed the more traditional choice for the holidays. I wasn't super picky with everything else though, but I did sub an item that was missing to their holiday cookies that looked too cute to eat.  In addition to the basket, I also ordered a gelato pie since they had that advertised on their instagram. After taste tasting for a few minutes, I decided to go with the rosemary with olive oil mixed with creme brûlée gelato flavor. Reason being that I was told before that their rosemary with olive oil was amazing, and that I personally love all things creme brûlée flavored.    The following day I arrived about 20 minutes late from the allotted time I gave them, but they weren't miffed by it at all. The packaging of both the gift basket and the gelato pie were perfectly handled and wrapped with care, no dents or mushiness. During my revisit though I tried their gingerbread and green tea kitkat gelato and loved the smooth, creamy texture as well as the hint of wafers from the green tea kit kat.   Needless to say the end result was satisfying, and most of the guests/hosts at the friends-giving event were delighted to try the gelato pie! It had the right amount of sweetness (no diabeetus!) with small tidbits of rosemary and you can taste the first feels of crunchiness when biting onto an actual creme brûlée after lit with fire. The gift basket was a bit much it seemed but they appreciated it nonetheless. It was my first time actually attending a friends-giving-anything so I took the time with slightly subtle first impressions via food haha.   Overall, I love Gelatology. Their flavors are always innovative and delectable and if given the time I would come by more than once a week! The owners are also always very friendly and patiently let you try out as many flavors as you would like- especially on busy days. Even during hot summer days they package your gelato to-go with great care!  Take note: they have a stamp card for customers via the Epoxy app!

It was Thanksgiving time and I wanted to do a different topping for my sweet potato casserole. The Ube marshmallows had a stunning appearance at first, but failed miserably from melting into the casserole. It held well in my hot coffee and was my alternative for sugar. A smooth, creamy topping for any steamy beverage! Much love to this delightful treat :)  It was such a tease for me to even stop by, since I was still recovering from a sinus cold and had to stay away from the infamous, wonderful gelato selection that looked oh so tempting to taste. I did have some self control this day and said no.. no .. well... no I shouldn't. And left with a strong desire to come back and try their gelato!!! And so I did.  My second trip was really for Christmas gifts. Again, I saw a post on their IG aka Instagram page of their custom gift baskets. And that checked off a few special love ones on my list.   I walked in and a sweet, patient lady named Desyree greeted me warmly and asked if I ever been here before. First time for gelato and I was handed spoon after spoonful of samples of her flavors of the day as well as any flavors that tickled my fancy. I love the limitless sampling, but after bites of a few flavors, I couldn't differentiate on what was what and what I just tasted before. It did make the most flavor one stand out when it came down to choosing one or two.   White Chocolate Macadamia Rocky Road. Blew my foodie mind into heart pieces. My first thought... Fresh ingredients, clean finish. If Desyree stock these at my nearby grocery store, I would buy the whole shelf and buy a mini freezer to stock them myself! I know.. just the thought of that, gave me a major brain freeze. Ouch. Til this day, I still think about this particular flavor and I'm hoping it makes a comeback one of these days.   Desyree was helpful and kind to show me all her different styles of gift baskets. Starting from $12-$75 and what is in each basket. She told me if I wanted to replace an item with a different item, I could. I can also add a gift certificate or even take anything out if I didn't like it. I did a few changes and customized three $75 gift baskets. All of them had peppermint barks, almond covered in chocolate, honey comb, nutella biscuit, gelatology mug, pretzel covered in chocolate, nutella marshmallows, polvorones, chocolate clusters almond turrone, sugar cookies, and a gift certificate.   I witnessed firsthand the expression on my brother's face trying out all these goodies. I was sweating bullets, my heart beating nervously.. as he took the first bite of the sugar cookies. His eyes lit up like a Christmas tree and said... oh wow... this is something else. One by one, he was impressed. I let him and his gf enjoy, but deep down I was like damn I wanna bite too! Sad face and all.. still no luck. I did taste a few the next day after he asked if I tried any at the store and I said no. It was light, flavorful, not too sugary, and simply YUMMY. Love their sugar cookies. This is coming from someone that thinks sugar cookies are boring and tasteless. Even their frosting was ever so cooling. A winter wonderland in your very own home!  The gift basket, itself was deliciously arranged! I was even a little bit jelly, not having one myself. But it is the Season of Giving and that's what it's all about. Making people happy and sharing moments together. People go through hard times and it's nice to find a place where you can just enjoy a few bites of happiness and forget about some things. Gelatology was able to fill our tummies with goodies and making it extra special for the Holidays.   This place is a few stores down from Serenade, in the Southwest Marketplace plaza. If I was in a foodie kinda mood, I would get a quick bite at Rice N Noodle, then get my dessert on at Gelatology, while taking a nice, hot soothing tea or coffee to go at Serenade.

Gelatology is located 10 miles away from the Strip (20 ~ 25 minutes drive) and the store name was inspired by the word  gelotology  (with three O's - means the study of laughter and its effects on the body).  I called the gelato shop location as the  wrong side of the plaza  - I drove into the plaza and had to slowly cruise my way to find this hidden store. Green Tea Kit Kat gelato is completely house-made and NOT the same as the one you find in Japanese supermarkets. Other interesting flavors I noticed include jalapeno cornbread, lemon poppyseed cake, and German chocolate cake.  Price: Quattro (4 oz, $4), sei (6 oz, $5.50), dodici (12 oz, $7), sedici (16 oz, $8.50). You can split two different flavors even with the smallest serving size. You can also choose other selection like liquid gelato bar (shakes), house soda,  coffees, and coppe (e.g. Fat Elvis [peanut butter gelato, strawberry puree, banana compote, bacon candy, peanut, croccantino, panna], Boscaiola [raspberry sorbetto, mint pesto, fruit macedonia, meringa], and Gelatology [pear and gorgonzola dolce gelato, oporto, sciroppo. caramelized walnut, roasted pears]).  ***  Pistachio and Fior de Latte ($4): Almost all flavors at Gelatology are made based on Fior de Latte (the key building block). Personally I think Fior de Latte is the best flavor here - simplicity at its finest. Now pistachio was good (due to its Fior de Latte base), but not the best gelato I've had (not as nutty as I would prefer).  ***  Gelatology isn't as good as other greatest gelato shops that I've tried in the past 2~3 years (Bianco Gelato in Miami, Bobboi Natural Gelato in La Jolla, Bulgarini Gelato in Los Angeles), but I still think Gelatology is still a great place to visit if you are craving for high quality gelato.

She was intrigued by the pear & gorgonzola based on what I had shared with her, and she ended up getting The Gelatology Coppe that features it.

I've been complaining that a lot of Vegas places do not have beans in their halo halo, and although you cannot see it, the ube and sweet been flavors come through very well. I was also fortunate to try the li hing pineapple gelato (first time they were serving it). There was just a small portion left by the end of the night and I felt so lucky to be able to have it!

If it wasn't quite so expensive I would probably be here everyday or at least every other day.   But to be honest, I'm probably here 2xs a week at the very least.    The service is great!  Whoever is behind the counter never rushes people when they are trying out samples and extremely patient and friendly.  My usual is the cookies and cream which I get every time along with one of their daily specials.  I've tried a bunch of their different Ube mixes, the chocolate and a few more I can't quite remember.

It's great to hear that the creative brain that made Art Of Flavors all the rave finally reopened under another name Gelatology. I'm sure a lot of fans of the Desyree ran AOF are very excited and swarm the place every day since they've opened right here in the SW.   Inside your presented with a variety of unique gelato and sorbetto flavors. I'm definitely a fan of that, the unique flavors. At the time they had nutella rocky road, rosemary creme brulee, pear and gorgonzola cheese to name some of the flavors. You can sample pretty much all of them, though I try not to do so many at one time. Be on the look out for their flavors of the day.   I went with the peanut butter and espresso Liquid Gelato Bar. It's basically a shake. You can select from the salted caramel, cookies and cream, espresso, peanut butter, and fior di latte. I liked it. I'm easy to please and will probably do the cookies and cream next time.  I'm not to big of a fan as others hence the non 5 star but glad that she's back. She's very friendly and I wish her all the success with Gelatology. Maybe I'll stop by for a fat elvis or one the flavors of the day.", "Date": "2015-08-22", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Cheryl", "ReviewID": "JDeVNTM51SdBsgAmK4giVQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "So good! The staff is really lovely and enthusiastic about giving samples and describing the flavors and ingredients used. The gelato is great! We were in Italy last month and ate Gelato there every day. This is just as good as it was there.  The flavors I have tried...... Sweet cream--simple and delicious  Carrot cake--amazing with chunks of soft cake and not over spiced  Grape--tastes just like real grapes only better because Gelato Cookies and cream--good Blueberry cheesecake -- just do it. So very good. I will be back to try more flavors.

It is a small shop inside a strip mall. There are about five small parlor tables inside. There is not much room inside when it gets busy.  The gelato was excellent. I tried the vegan peanut salted taffy. It was very good. They have several different flavors that change daily. They also have some flavors mixed together that I never seen before. You have to go there and check out the variety available.

They are so different in flavor and texture. . .the actual make up of the ingredients. . .  Did you know that Gelato actually has less fat then normal Ice Cream?  Well it does.  Gelato tends to be made with more milk then heavy cream. . .like ice cream.  So if you want to think that Gelato is healthier for you then ice cream. . .in a sense. . .it actually is as it has less fat!  =)  You might also wonder then why is gelato so much creamier then ice cream?  Well it's the temperature that they serve it at.  Ice cream is normally served at 6-10 degrees F. . .while Gelato is served traditionally at 10-22 degrees F.  So OF COURSE, gelato feels and tastes creamier.    So now that the ice cream vs gelato lesson is over. . .=)  Let's get on with the review on the gelato!!  I have been here numerous times and they have never disappointed.  I have tried more flavors then I bought of course. . .since I tasted about 5-7 before buying a cup with 2 flavors in it. . .LOL    But the one that stands out is the Gorgonzola with pear. . .if you love gorgonzola cheese as much as I do. . .then you would have LOVED this one.  But remember once you have something and you love it. . .go back often as they change their flavors frequently!  Olive Oil gelato. . .one of my all time favorites!!  Yeah I tend to like sweets with a savory twist and this totally made my day!  I could tell they had used EVOO from the first cold press as the flavor of the EVOO was very very fresh and fruity!  LOVED it!  I also loved their caramel popcorn gelato. . .the flavors dead on. . .BUT I have to say that popcorn was a little soggy for me. . .  Peanut Butter. . .OMG. . .heavenly!!  So creamy!!  It tasted like you were eating heavenly light spoonfuls of peanut buttery goodness!!  In other words, I have yet to have anything that I did NOT like. . .I have some that I liked over others. . .BUT everything has been delicious!  Writing this review makes me wish that I had a large cup of gelati in front of me right now!!  =)  Ambiance. . .it is really cute and clean. . .very bright!  People taking my order have always been very friendly.    They seem to be branching out into other baked goods. . .sadly I can not write a review on those as I have never gotten past the gelati!

Like right now. . .go get some!!!  =)", "Date": "2016-02-22", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jane", "ReviewID": "pswk4OCMa7jkTFPPIp8aYA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "This place has been long over due for a visit and finally came with some friends. If anybody knows, Desyree had already established a reputation of being the queen of gelato for many years. I came here already having the same expectations and the understanding that it will be an awesome experience, as before when she was at a previous shop. I'm so glad this place is closer to my house and the service is on point. She lets you sample everything you want to ensure you get the right flavor. At the end, I decided to get the blueberry lemon and kit Kat sesame gelato. The combination of those two were like beautiful unicorns frolicking in your mouth and rainbows shooting out of your eyes. I was hoping that they had pistachio gelato since that is always my to go flavor, but this experience made me get something outside the box and be a rebel. This also gives me the excuse to go back and see what else they have. They do have new ice-cream/gelato cakes that I must go back for and try. Mmm...

I love that she remembers all her customers and takes the time to talk to you and appreciates the business you bring. I am constantly raving about this little gem to all my friends and co-workers and they in turn are doing the same. You really can't get any better than this.   I honestly hate that she has an instagram posting daily flavors because it forces me to get off my ass and drive all the way to her place. I've been here way too many times but I can't help it. The flavors are always intriguing and it's always fun to stop by on the weekends to see what savory flavors she comes up with.   My personal favorites are cookie butter, salted caramel, lychee, chocolate, pear and gorgonzola cheese... okay maybe all of them. And if I'm too lazy to scoop, I love getting the salted caramel shake.

On to my short review: Desyree warmly welcomed me into her shop and asked me if it was my first time there (it was). She then explained to me her methods and her madness and let me try a scoop of every single one of her flavors that she had that day! I felt bad because I went through so many of her little plastic spoons... I literally could not decide what I wanted to have, but ultimately decided on Peanut Butter. Very rich and flavorful. I was tempted to get another scoop of something else, but I really have to watch my figure! Service is a big deal to me. So when the product is good and the service is excellent, I will be returning and often.
