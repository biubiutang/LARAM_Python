The oxtail ramen is definitely the highlight of  my dinner. For $11.5, i think pretty good deal. I am no ramen expert, but I think pretty comparable with Sora or Jinya. Much more spacious than those other ramen places though, which is a plus in my book.   Server is nice enough to offer extra soup when she realizes my ramen has no more soup. As long as they keep their consistency, I am sure they will be as successful as other ramen places.", "Date": "2017-01-01", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jovi", "ReviewID": "2W_1F235pbfs6FKZvERAyA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "A little less than 2 weeks ago I had noticed this place just opened up. And it's the second ramen joint to be within a 5 minute drive from my residence, which is a plus! Because sometimes I just don't feel like driving all the way to China Town, y'know?  Once you walk in, you immediately notice how spacious this place is. Compared to many of the other ramen restaurants in Vegas, which are tiny little spots.   My roomie and I were seated right away at a table. The servers were attentive, prompt, and friendly. We ordered: the Ohjah Special ramen with oxtail, Tonkatsu ramen, shrimp skewers, and the house fried rice.   My roomie loved the oxtail. She said it was juicy and fell right off the bone. She was also very impressed with the noodle to broth ratio. She said at some other ramen places there's either too many noodles or too much broth. And Ohjah nailed it with the noodle to broth ratio.  A server brought some spicy oil to our table. I added it to my Tonkatsu ramen and it made my dish taste much better (and this is coming from someone who usually stays away from spicy). The Tonkatsu broth was already flavorful prior to adding the spicy oil, however, it greatly enhanced my first time experience at Ohjah. The shrimp skewers were very tasty. The house fried rice was eh, nothing special. I probably won't order the house fried rice again.  At the end of our meal, a girl approached our table with a tablet to pay for our check. I'm still highly impressed with how technology works nowadays in regards to paying for meals at restaurants lol. Anyways, it was easy and simple.

Saw a month + ago that Ohjah is opening up a Noodle a.k.a Ramen place near my house and had been dying to try it out. I have been to Ohjah's two other locations for their hibachi, which I am a big fan of but Japanese ramen is a pretty new concept to this brand. Ever since the Noodle House's opening last week, I have already been there twice, trying different ramen and side dishes each time. I have to say that when it comes to ramen, broth is one of the most important thing to me, next being the noodle. The broth is flavorful and the noodle the right texture. It is definitely one of the better ramen-offering place in the Southwest part of Las Vegas. The interior design is modern and trendy; the place is also located at a convenient location where new shops and restaurants are popping up. Also wanted to mention that their waiter and waitresses are super nice and polite that I double-tipped them. I hope their excellent customer service never change!  I have tried their Tonkotsu Ramen, Shoyo Ramen, Ohjah House Ramen, Seafood Ramen, Takoyaki, and Tako Wasabi so far --- all are great!

We tried the seafood ramen, tan tan men, and ohjah house ramen. Although not stated on the menu they can customize the spice level. Medium spice here was just enough to give you nice flavor without burning you up. Mild was basically no spice. The ramen broth is creamy and hearty. Seafood ramen had a whole assortment of seafood including fish, shrimp, clams, crab legs, squid along with the veggies and seaweed.

This place is pretty good. Came here around 6:30pm on a Friday night and when I walked in, I was seated within seconds. The place wasn't busy at all which is weird for a Friday night in this area. The decor is really nice, and the staff is attentive.   I ordered the Ohjah house ramen and a side of gyoza. The house ramen comes with some oxtail, some chashu pork, and all the other standard ramen stuff in (I think) a tonkatsu broth. I asked for a medium level spicy.   The broth came out warm but not really hot. The spice was more of a pepper type spice instead of a chili type. It wasn't spicy at all, just heavily peppered. Since the broth wasn't that hot, none of the fat on the oxtail really cooked making it mostly not edible. The noodles were good, but nothing special. The gyoza were pretty decent, but the sauce that came with them was bland.  The reason I feel jaded is because there's a ramen place walking distance that's so much better. Overall, I'm undecided if I'd come back. If you want ramen, and don't want to wait an hour at the place next door, then this place is probably ok.

OX TAIL RAMEN. Once I saw it on the menu, I HAD TO GET IT. But instead, I decided on the Ohjah House Ramen---beef, chasu, AND ox tail. MEAT LOVERS HEAVEN. *drooooolz*  A problem with ox tail in most restaurants is the level of tenderness. Most times I've had ox tail at a sub par pho restaurant, the ox tail was difficult to eat, but Ohjah does it RIGHT. Literally fall off the bone, juicy and succulent. The broth is something you must have in this cold ass Vegas winter; definitely hits the spot! Another thing I enjoyed is the piece of bok choy that is included in the ramen, it was a perfect, refreshing, addition to the meal.   One thing that did irk me a bit is the noodle to broth ratio. The amount of noodles and toppings were PERFECT, it was a lot more than what other ramen spots serve, but the bowl could stand a little more broth ¯\_(ツ)_/¯   BEST THING, (better than Jinya): SUPER SPACIOUS.

When a soup's broth is too oily or salty, I can't stand to eat it. However, this place had none of those problems.  My friend and I ordered the Tan Tan Men (Spicy) and the Ohjah House Ramen. We also ordered two appetizers: gyoza and squid skewers (All of these are in the photo collage). Everything tasted great and we had no complaints about the freshness or quality of the food.  My friend ordered the Tan Tan Men and said it wasn't as spicy as she thought it would be. It had more of a sweet taste. The condiments on the table that could be added to any dish, such as the chili powder, helped give it more heat and flavor. If you want to add chili paste (topping), it's a dollar extra. I added it to my order, but the quantity that they gave was more like ten cents worth! It was a really tiny, tiny scoop of chili. For someone who can handle a lot of heat in her food, I could have done without it. It eventually got lost in the broth. lol  Pricing is about the same compared to other ramen houses and the staff's service was not bad. Our server wasn't as friendly and seemed to be a lil annoyed, but everyone else who came around was really nice.

The only downside of this restaurant is the quantity of the appetizers. The chicken wings dont have a lot of meat.

Ramen game strong here in the Southwest, seriously!   You maybe familiar with Ohjah as they have sushi and steakhouse restaurants throughout the Vegas Valley.  This restaurant specializes in ramen only.  Basic bowl : The base includes Chashu, seaweed and bean sprouts. From there you can choose different broths stocks, Tonkatsu, Curry, Shoyu, Vegetable, and Miso.   There's also a selection of set of 'House Special Ramen' you can order.  Also as with Ramen-Ya in the valley , you can add addition toppings for additional charge.   I went for the Ohjah House Ramen from the House Special Ramen section.  Tonkatsu style broth, Oxtail, beef, Chashu, and soft boiled egg. When this huge hot steamy bowl was presented to me I knew I was goin to LOVE it! Man, that broth! Texture was like silky. Noodles are fresh, al dente, 2 bones of tender Oxtail, Chashu (pork belly) slice also dissolved when you took a bite. Perfect bowl of ramen! And it was just $9.75! Really reasonable price.   There are also appetizers you can get, but I just glossed over that part and did not read what they had since I wasn't super hungry, so I'll leave it up to you guys with the bigger appetite to report back on it.   I like that this place is spacious and not cramped like other noodle houses. Looks like they accommodate more people too. Kitchen is enclosed with window facing the dining area, so you have a clear view of what's going on in there.   Service was excellent! Host will take you to your table and will also be the one to check you out when you are ready to leave.  The servers were great! My order was taken promptly and came out quick. Kudos to the attentive server who offered more broth to warm up my ramen cause I got a little distracted taking pix. :/... that was really nice, he didn't have to do that. Thank you!

I was there last night with my friends, we ordered couple appetizer wasabi octopus, garlic edamame , if u like hot sake, those two are very good when u have a drink. We also tried the gyoza and chicken wings this time. Highly recommend the gyoza, it is pan fried pork dumplings with the dipping sauce , so awesome. For the noodle, one of my friend like spicy, he ordered the tan tan ramen. We also order the Ohjah house ramen which one carry the oxtail , the tonkatsu  has chashu and soft boiled egg, so delicious. Great service too, when I was sit front booth waiting for my friend, a sweet girl came check couple times help me the drink. During the dinner time, clean the dish we finished , refill our hot tea.  I love this place, definitely will come again and try more.", "Date": "2017-01-16", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Garth", "ReviewID": "7sDnLP2S_fwlsb8WgMGiOw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "My favorite ramen place is Koba's in Himeji Japan..... my next favorite is now Ohjah's Noodle House on Durango Drive in Las Vegas.

Now we found our new favorite place! To start with we ordered takoyaki and its combination of crunchy and creamy texture makes you crave for more. Then we ordered Tonkatsu Ramen ( where ever we go this is a must in our order) Chicken Katsu for my daughter and then we wanted to try one of there house special TanTan Men Ramen. Everything we order came so fast and was so so good! The servers are so accomodating checking on us everytime, they even offered extra soup for our ramen. They even mention the promo they have if you do review them on yelp.

So... I'm grateful that Ohjah decided to branch out from Teppanyaki to Noodles. I'm going to keep this one really brief. There is a wide variety of good food here from appetizers to beer. I recommend adding some pepper oil to your meal unless you are really really against spice. I needed a few spoonfuls to make my ramen taste just right and I'm not a huge spice nut. They also provide you with garlic cloves upon request which added an extra depth of flavor for me. No extra charge. Everything we had was very delicious and pretty much on par with any other ramen joint you'll find around town. If you are there for the first time, the Ohjah House Special is a good choice. Very good. While the food is good, there is nothing completely mind-blowing. And that's ok. Because to me, the real advantage that this place is that it can accommodate a lot more people than your average ramen joint in Las Vegas. There is plenty of table seating as well as counter seating and parking doesn't seem to be an issue here. That is a huge plus because I'm so over waiting for 45 minutes just to have a bowl of ramen. For this reason alone, I will be frequenting this joint much more.  This place just opened recently so the staff seems like they are being over-cautious but they are friendly and warm. I'm actually looking forward to going down the list of food items like I usually do at places I like.", "Date": "2017-01-13", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Shawn", "ReviewID": "Z3yfbTIJec1lCLcUKadg8w", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I really can't suggest any fresh ideas to this perfect noodle house experience.
