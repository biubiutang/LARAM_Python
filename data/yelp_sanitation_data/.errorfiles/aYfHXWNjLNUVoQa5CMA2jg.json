A medical professional mentioned that it may be my gallbladder and prescribed me three medications that unfortunately didn't help! After having another attack, I took matters into my own hands and decided to research foods that naturally help your gallbladder and most importantly, avoid irritating it.  I found that vegetable juices like beet, cucumber, tender baby greens, swiss chard, dandelion greens, beet greens, celery, carrots, ginger, and tumeric are great for gallbladder health as well as organic grape and apple juices. Other helpful foods to add to juices: lemon, avocado, vinegar, berries, papaya, pears, and flax and hemp seeds/oils.  Therefore, I was on a mission to find organic, cold-pressed juices that utilized these foods and hoped it would heal me! The store is very easy to find, in fact, I had seen it while driving by on Ft. Apache. Access and parking is simple as well. I love the interior! The adorable bee and honeycomb theme complete with adorable packaging, matching wall art, and the amazing table re-purposed from a tree!  The staff was so friendly, helpful, and insisted on samples. I told him which juices intrigued me and why, so I honed in on Bee WHealthy and Bee On Point. After sampling the two, I chose Bee On Point that is comprised of cucumber, celery, carrot, apple, kale, beet, dandelion, radish, lemon, ginger, turmeric, and pepper (16.9 fl. oz. for $10.99). Neither of the juices really tickled my fancy in the flavor department, however, that truly doesn't bother me nor will it stop me from future consumption because I need to minimize sugar (even natural sugar) intake as much as possible and that's typically what makes juices taste better.  Anyway, the juice was great and filled me for three hours! That was enough time for me to finish what I needed to do for the day and get home for my next meal. The great news is that after just THREE days of eating and drinking the gallbladder-helpful foods, I was able to stop the attacks! It's really wonderful having access to a place like The Juice Standard to have truly healing products when you have health issues. It was honestly the only place I trusted to have something that wouldn't trigger another attack and I was very grateful for it. Your body will heal itself if you give it the right tools.   FYI: You receive $1 off for each glass bottle returned! But the bottles are so nice, you might want to find a purpose for them at home. Also, keep in mind that these bottles are 99.9% juice which means you're getting the good stuff, not just water or miscellaneous fillers.

My first visit was around Nov. 2014. Before I actually decided to try the juices, I did some research on the company and  the benefits of organic juices. I was drawn to Jamie's story and how juicing has helped change her family's lifestyle. This was important to me because I needed a more convenient way to have breakfast or lunch since I am always on the go.   As I walked in, I was immediately greeted by the workers.  Everyone was very welcoming and explained the different types of juices offered. On a biological perspective, I was thoroughly impressed by the knowledge the workers had on the juices (esp since I got my degree in biology). This only solidified that the workers are properly trained and genuinely care about educating customers to better their health.   What's great about The Juice Standard is that they let you try every flavor ! I tried samples of different juices since I was interested in trying the 1-day cleanse. Some of the juices I was not too fond off - I felt that it is more of an acquired taste. However, the flavor I enjoyed the most is  Bee Magnificent  and decided to get a 16.9 fl oz bottle.   Overall, I had a good experience and will definitely come back. On my next visit, I hope to meet both Jamie & Marcella! Can't wait to try their new location!  Pros: -Great Service -Organic -Knowledgeable staff -Very Clean -Helps regulate your tummy and make you  regular  again  -If you return your glass bottle, you get $1 off your next purchase!  Cons: -Kinda pricey (if you're on a college budget - but worth it!!!) -A lot of time on the toilet", "Date": "2015-06-01", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Adam", "ReviewID": "T99rP_6A8aXATCu3VjS04Q", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Excellent selection of juices and coffee!

I came here during their soft opening and it seemed like they already had some regulars as I noticed them calling someone by name.  When I walked in, I immediately liked the look of the inside with the menu and the pamphlets, cute names of products, and helpful tips with juicing. The owners were very helpful and Marcella explained to me all about their juices, how they are made, and the benefits. I appreciated the taste test area because of course we all want to know what we are going to get.  I was interested in a 3 day juice cleanse but seeing that I have never juiced an entire day, I was not sure how I would respond or if I could handle it. I ended up only doing one day.   The Magnificent- filtered water, raw cashew, agave, vanilla bean, and cinnamon.  perfect at night time when you have been juicing all day. It felt like a treat and I don't know what it was but I was unable to finish it. I'm not sure if it was the juice overload or what did it.   I also liked the Energized, the Love, and the one with cayenne pepper. I like the glass bottle packaging but can I say it does not do well with drinking straight out of the bottle, lots of spills. Maybe you are expected to pour it or use a straw. The small plastic bottles are much easier to drink right out of.   I would like to try the juice cleanse again but probably when I don't have to work and can stay home. I appreciate the $1 off for bringing back the bottles. I wish they had some sort of loyalty card or system though because the cost is pretty high for me.   I know Marcella mentioned the juices have a 4 day shelf life but I wonder if the date on top was the expiration date or the date made. My juices had different dates on top.   In all I am happy a healthy place like this opened up near home where I can come get some good quality juice.", "Date": "2014-03-21", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Marco", "ReviewID": "zbD3I1IIMKTwQI42bSbbvA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "It's simply perfection in every bottle.

A local juice bar i'm down to support.  They bottle their juice at the store with locally farmed raw produce without HPP (High Pressure Processing).  HPP is just a method to extend shelf life, and from what i read it has very little effects in characteristic of molecular food compounds; taste, vitamins, and nutrients.  Hence why Juice Standards are super duper fresh, Bee!  Without the HPP they're also able to package their cold-press juice in glass bottles which you can return each for a $1 discount off your next purchased.  Bottles are $10 each for 16.9oz and there are many to choose from.    I eat pretty bad since i have retarded hours [but mainly because you, f-nuts (i mean that in the nicest way possible) always yelp tasty looking spots] , so i've always try to include green juice in my daily intake when im on the go esp when i wake up on an empty stomach.  Thankfully i don't need all that fiber i'm missing out on, and other than that I don't really mess with any other root or fruit juice.  Personal choice.  So this store is really cool because when you walk in you can see huge cambros full of raw veggies through the glass refrigerator doors.  They do everything in house, not in the front i would think but in the back.  They just store some in the front along with ready to be purchased juice bottles or samples with the help of Jamie or Marcella who are both knowledgable about their products.  Today, I was able to pick out my fav green juice, Bee Love (Carrots, Celery, Parsley, Spinach) from them with Jamie's guidance.   I've also picked up Bee Effective (Apple, Zucchini, Spinach, Swiss Chard, Radish, Celery, Romaine, Kale, Parsley, Coconut Water), and it says it contain tree nuts, but it's actually the coconut.   And just because of allergy season I never got to try, but I got two bottles of the Bee True To You(Cucumber, Lemon, Ginger, Turmeric, Honey, Cayenne) which has some local Honey in it.  I doubt two bottles will have any effect of the outcome, but i still want to try anyways.  Tasted good but got a nice throat kick to it with it.  Juice Standard has an amazing thing going on.  I've only see a juice bar like this in cali, but these ladies have more confident in their own products which having me believing in them too.  And about once a week i'll need reassurance.    Tip:  Savor your juice.  Swirling in your mouth is important part of digestive system.  Your saliva has Ptyalin, an enzyme that helps break down food and speed up chemical reaction so your body can retain more nutrient.", "Date": "2014-03-11", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Beth", "ReviewID": "wJ3US2HUEdfMnvvcqqWMow", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Visited here as my boyfriend's co-workers have been raving about the place.

They offer fresh cold pressed organic juice and it doesn't come cheap (understandably so...). I've always wanted to try a cleanse and purchased their prepackaged juice option (see photos).   Overall, I loved their juices and enjoyed my one day cleanse. I did not do this to drop weight and do not believe that cleanses should be intended for that. I DO think that this is a good way to get a lot of vitamins in your system and think that cleanses are good to reset cravings and kick start a healthy lifestyle program. Besides, I enjoy juices regularly without a cleanse.", "Date": "2014-08-04", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Kara", "ReviewID": "zDkhsclPrcOJUHYqE_mm1g", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Love, love this place!!!  I found it by chance because I had just gotten off of a weekend of partying from my bachelorette party and needed to detox and reset my body.  There happened to be a Living Social coupon (different company) for a juice cleanse, so that's what originally sparked my interest.  I always rather support local business, so I yelped juice bars and came across this gem :)  Both owners were there and were so friendly and knowledgable.  Jamie gave us our sampling and explained what each juice does.  We decided to do a 3 day cleanse and it was pretty easy.  The amount, how many bottles a day you drink and the duration between each one I think was the trick.  I could've done more!  Next time, I'll probably do 5 days or maybe even 7.  All the juices tasted great, and I loved the  suggested  order of drinking them.  The magnificent, which was the cashew milk one, was so perfect to end the evening.

Case and point? After a good a$$-whooping at Decibel Crossfit, I was beyond hungry and needed to refuel muy pronto!  The Juice Standard was the first thing that popped up on my Yelp App and I figured I'd use the opportunity to delete a bookmark then seek out a lunch spot. Owners Jaime and Marcella are two blessings in disguise that bring a much needed product to Vegas, as we unfortunately live in a city where GMO, processed and HFC drink options are everywhere, and the Juice Standard is a very refreshing option.  Depending on what you are looking for, there are different combinations and blends to fit your needs, and there's even samples upfront for you to try before making a purchase. I tried a green one which was a little too grassy for me at that moment then a few more after that. I managed to settle on the Grateful and Excellent blends.  After a few sips of the Grateful blend (I shared the Excellent blend with wifey the next day), I actually felt my hunger disappear! It probably has to do with the HPP process, and your body absorbs and retain the healthy nutrients quicker.  They also have juice cleansing packets if you choose to do so. Blends are $10-$11(16.9 ounces) with a four day shelf life(From the date processed) and a $1 deposit for every returned bottle. Give the Juice Standard a try and do your health a favor, ALOHA!!!

A lot of their produce is sourced from California, which means a smaller carbon footprint. Their bottling is either glass (all class) or plastic, and the plastic bottles are, of course, BPA free. What's not to love?  If that's not enough to entice you, the radiant ladies they have behind the counter (or the adorable Queen Bees that are wandering the floor this afternoon) are incredibly friendly AND knowledgable. Their concept goes beyond trendy. When they began to tell me about how certain vitamins will be absorbed 100% because of the pairings with other vegetables, and a mention of trace minerals (87 in BeWhealthy, if you're counting), I knew I had come to the right place! It's a breath of fresh air having nutrition that makes sense and does work for you, instead of just adding chia seed to everything and calling it healthy.  Their selection of smoothies are limited to a mere four, but they run the gamut of every avenue of nutrition you need. Fruit based, protein based, veggie based, and fat based (think coconut, avocado). They have superfood add-ons as well such as chia, hemp, flax, coconut meat, bee pollen, spirulina, nutritional yeast.. The list goes on. I've tried all but the protein smoothie and can confidently say they are delicious and filling! I love my liquid lunches on the go.

We didn't get the chance to drink them all in time before they expired.   We decided for us, we would prefer to go buy the juice that we intend to drink instantly. When we went back today, we brought the 12 bottles back, and just wanted 2 drinks.  They told us that they would take the 12 bottles ($12 off), but only give us $2 off this order, with a receipt showing an additional 10 bottles returned.  I explained that we only intend to buy drinks as we drink them, so we won't ever buy 12 at a time again.  They said  that's fine, but we can't give you the discount .  Bottom line:  they are willing to give a discount of $1 per bottle returned. But they will only do it bottle for bottle, meaning that they try to lock you in to buying bulk.

I also learned that they give their juices a 4 day expiration from the time pressed even though the health department states that they may have a shelf life of 7 days. The greatest part is that all of the ingredients are organic. So the price point is perfect when you think about the quality of ingredients you are getting. Another plus is that when you bring back the bottle to them for recycling they give you a $1 credit to use.   My favorite is the Bee WHealthy because I enjoy juices with more greens than fruits.

A one day cleanse every two weeks or every month would not hurt. I would do this once a week if I could afford it.

I went in for lunch after already picking what I wanted online.  El greeted me when I walked in right away. And even offered samples.  She was very knowledgeable!

The first day was a little tough-by the end of the first day I had a headache and was nauseous all night. I took that as a definite sign that I was detoxing which is what I wanted. The second day was much easier and I felt a lot better- and by the morning of the third day I felt really good- I also felt like I could keep going on this fast easily for another day or two at least- but unfortunately I had a dinner I had to attend that night so technically I only did it 2.5 days. It helped get rid of my cravings for unhealthy food and I felt like my mind was much more clear. Would definitely recommend either a 1 day or 3 day cleanse- I think there is still a great benefit to just a 1 day cleanse- and once you get past the second day it's really easy to do a 3 day cleanse- if you don't start to get sick of juice by then. Lol I hope to do a 1 day cleanse weekly for a while- or a longer 3-5 day cleanse when I get back from an upcoming trip. I just love how convenient and high quality their juice is too.", "Date": "2014-04-18", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Chelsey", "ReviewID": "PizW1Nos7YSwbwBYkKqXrA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I'm addicted to this place!

I've been searching for a juice place for 3 weeks to no avail. The locals in town were telling me to go to Jamba Juice, and hadn't heard of an actual juice bar. I happened to stumble upon the juice standard on Tuesday, and I am in heaven. This place is amazing. They don't make the juice right there in front of you, individually, like in Houston. But, they have several to choose from and they make them everyday so you're never hurting for a particular flavor. The bottles are large, at 16.9 oz and they are $9 each. Also, you will get a discount if you bring the bottles back. (please at least rinse them, otherwise that's gross) So far I have tried  the bee legendary & bee magnificent nut milks and they are fabulous. I have also tried the bee whealthy & bee on point and they are also delish.

Juices are freshly pressed and they provide free samples, so there's no mystery on what you purchase.  Their selections are plenty and they are very informative on what benefit each juice does.    The only thing is when they run out, they run out and you will have to come back again the next day.  I made the mistake going in on Saturday and they were out of my first 4 selections.  It was frustrating but I guess this is a good frustration because you know everything is made fresh.    The price is a bit steep but it's about the same almost every where, so for first timer, be prepare for the tag price but you will not get any fresher juices than fresh pressed from here.

I decided to get the protein power smoothie. Now I have had a hundred different kinds of smoothies and I am not picky at all. Plus the ingredients were all ones I am very familiar with so it sounded good. But it tasted like a salad. Like a salad with parsley, mustard and agave. Not a good combination at all.

I came here & spent nearly $60 for juice! I then went to Yoshinoya & Krispy Kreme. Who am I fooling!?!?   Ok let's move on because there's no helping me. This place really has it going on. It's very clean, very cute & the juice presentations are awesome. It definitely inspires one to get healthy even if that lasts for only an hour.   I walked in & was immediately greeted by the nicest kid who is eager to sample me up & we had a lot of fun trying nearly everything. Sampling is the smartest thing ever because it really gets us in the mood to spend more money & I instantly knew what I could attempt to drink and what I absolutely couldn't. I love that he tried getting me in on the healthiest ones which I had a hard time swallowing. Grass isn't my favorite flavor. Some of these juices were way too hard core for me however I was pleasantly surprised that some of them tasted really good! So I went for it & splurged! They have so many great fresh ingredients such as apples, cucumbers, celery, lemons, kale, beets, Brazilian nuts, vanilla & so much more!   My plan is to skip lunch & juice it up at work. We shall see how long I last before someone forces me to eat something because I'm extra mean when hangry. This stuff is all natural & organic & I'm excited!

I appreciate the fact that they use high-quality ingredients and source from nearby California, and I especially love that their juices are bottled to take and enjoy over the next few days. Add in that they're raw, organic, non-HPP, and everything else Gwyneth Paltrow would approve of, and you've got a stellar product.   I recently moved here from the Bay area and was unpleasantly surprised that so many places here in LV claim that they have juice, only to give me an overpriced rinky-dink plastic cup with a non-harmonious medley of fruits and veggies. I am sorely missing vendors like Juicer Heroes, Project Juice, and the ever-convenient Pressed.  I am so happy to find a company putting forth the quality of product that I expect when I am juicing. I will admit to being a little put off by pricing- which is $10+/bottle, higher even than trendy Cali prices, by a good 20%. They have a niche product though, and their portions are slightly larger. I will definitely be taking advantage of their bottle-return discounts though. I would like to be able to pull up nutritional info on each particular juice online, as it is not posted on the bottle itself: their website also is well-designed and informative, just as they are in-store.   Overall: service is friendly, space is attractively decorated, and the product itself is high-quality. I hope to see more local companies picking up the slack and providing more options that are on par with the standard set here at Juice Standard! I hope they add some sort of loyalty program for frequent juicers as they settle in- I love a liquid lunch but I can't swing $300/month for it.

Juices are a bit pricey, but their packaging is high-quality and keeps the juices really cold when transporting them.
