The decor was quaint, wooden, and very reminiscent of traditional Phillipine household decor. I really liked the vibe of this place; the staff was all friendly and ordering went smoothly.   It's a turo-turo place (tagalog translation: to point), so you basically point to the dish you want to order and then you pay at the end of the line. It's an easy way to try a lot of different foods in one place, to be honest. Don't expect super fancy dining either, what you see is what you get -- traditional Filipino dishes.   I had the two item combo plate which comes with steamed rice and two choices of entrees. I picked the sinigang na bangus (milkfish in a soup that has a tamarind base) and the classic Filipino beefsteak. What a good deal because it was under $10!  The portioning for the sinigang na bangus was one fish steak with some soup, but they could've thrown in some veggies other than ginger. It had the superb sour taste, which means they put the right amount of sampalok (tamarind) in the soup.  The beefsteak was PERFECT! It had the strong kalamansi taste (more citrusy) which went well with the tenderness of the beef and sweetness of the white onion. It really was marinated to the right taste... It's making my mouth water just thinking about it! It's THE perfect pairing to your steamed rice. The steamed rice, however, was a little more on the wet side, which isn't ideal but still good to eat.  This is a good showcase of Filipino heritage. The kind of food they have out is the kind of food you actually have to (and want to!) try within the Filipino food realm.  Oh, and they have good BBQ skewers!

It's your typical Filipino restaurant with all the menu options you find at other places which makes it mediocre. My family owns a Filipino restaurant and a mini grocery store in New Jersey. So, I know how much work owning a restaurant is like.  Anyway, for me Fiesta Filipina is hit or miss. I usually order food I don't normally make at home. Food are sometimes too salty and other days they are perfectly seasoned. Some of the dishes are floating with grease than others. It would be nice if they can filter out the fats/oil.   I ordered the 2 combo with bikol express and the caldereta. The bikol express didn't taste the same when I was here the last time. I was disappointed because that's one of my favorite entree. Anything mixed in with coconut milk I am likely to order. I ordered the caldereta and it wasn't too salty and it has a great tomato base flavor with great garnish peppers and olives. I prefer my meat cut a little thinner rather than serving it as thick chunks, but the meat is always tender.   Overall, this is one of the many places around town I would rather go to eat Filipino food. I just wish they can be more consistent in how their food actually taste. I can see how non Filipino diners will be confused when they are not accustomed to the cuisine. However, the lumpia shanghai and pancit are always great!

My buddy Andrew is Filipino, and told me this place is authentic and delicious. We planned to hang out one night after work, so he offered to pick up some food for us. I have only ever tried lumpia so I told him to get whatever. For a 2 item combo, depending what you get, it is like $6-7 and comes with white rice. We both had combos, and then he ordered lumpia and pancit! There was so. much. food. He came home with:  Lumpia shanghai Pancit Pork Adobo Beefsteak Bbq chicken skewer  Beef stew (this has a proper name but I don't know what it is)  My favorite things were the lumpia and the bbq chicken skewers. The lumpia are bite sized, and come with a tasty sweet chili dipping sauce. They are seriously sooo delicious I couldn't stop popping them into my mouth. The bbq chicken was really good too. You get 2 skewers of chicken that is marinated in 7-up and other spices and seasonings  I did not care for the beefsteak. It was very gelatinous and there were chunks of fat swimming around in the bowl. I did like the pancit, which is similar to chow mein but has a much different flavor. I was soooo full after all that food and went into a food coma for about 4 hours. The price was amazing too! He got all that food for around $25 and we had plenty of leftovers.  I was really looking forward to trying the crispy pata, but they were all out. I also want to try the Halo Halo which is like a sweet shaved iced, and turon, which is a sweet lumpia roll.

My favorite food there is their BBQ sticks!  There's just something about filipino BBQ sticks that just make them the best ever!  They have either pork or chicken.    I have noticed that this restaurant has too many pork dishes, more than any other type of meat.  I was hoping for chicken adobo but they usually only have pork, or pork sinigang instead of beef sinigang.  Also, I personally am a bit picky with where I get my dinaguan but decided to try it here one day.  It was a bit soup-y, where as I like the texture kinda thick, and there was not as much meat in it, it was whatever the thin, hard part of the pig is.      Overall, I am still a fan of this place.

They have really good crispy pata, pancit bihon, bicol express, bistek, and lechon kawali. They even have karioka which my mom loves. The only negative thing I can say about this place is that they need to stick with the traditional Kapampangan halo-halo with pastillas and macapuno, instead of the Tagalog version, and  their pancit luglug/palabok needs more consistency and flavor; they need to readjust their sauce recipe and put more shrimp in it.

If you want traditional Filipino food, then come here. It's affordable, it's yummy, and I really feel like I'm back at Lola's house on fermin street in manila. Thanks again fiesta! The only complaint I have is there is no air conditioning.. Only a fan so it's hot (but I feel like I'm back in the Philippines again!

My husband loves the bar b q and cantaloupe drink.   I love everything else :).  My daughter is also a fan of Fiesta in Jones Blvd.  You can also call to get a to-go order so that you can just pick up if you are in a hurry.  Parking is also not bad at this place.", "Date": "2016-10-04", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Rachel", "ReviewID": "hPMKA64ieuUo0oWnjppKPA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "My favorite is the BBQ chicken skewers with sauce on the rice!

Usually, I don't really crave or want Filipino food because the other places I've tried have been alright. I always thought it was more appetizing to look at but lacks in taste when you actually eat it.   This is a fast food type restaurant where most of the food is already prepared sitting under heat lamps. Some stuff looked very adventurous and exotic but I recognized the staples like lechon, pork and chicken skewers, adobo, Pancit etc.  I got the combo with a beef stew and lechon. My friends ordered a bunch of different things and we all shared. We also ordered the crispy pork Patta. I loved the lechon here. The skin is so crispy!!  The pork is a good mixture of fatty and juicy. People who don't like fat won't appreciate it but I definitely do!  The beef stew I got was really good too. It was flavorful, although a bit oily, but the meat was tender and not stringy or dry at all. Loved it. I also liked their Pancit and meat skewers too. The Patta was huge!  It was really crispy and comes with various sauces. I prefer the Lechon better because the skin was crispier and the meat is more tender.   What I didn't like was all the food was super oily, and the halo halo was a big disappointment. The ice was shaved very corse and they didn't put a lot of condensed milk so it was like eating ice with jelly in between bites. Could have done without it.   All in all I would definitely come back for the lechon!", "Date": "2016-08-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ron", "ReviewID": "toD_iWiewbRLJab9OpyQWQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "My go-to dishes are the pork sinigang, pancit, lechon, mungo beans, and pinakbet. In that order. The dishes tend to be a bit on the greasy side, but the overall flavor of the dish is still there. They tend to speak to you in Tagalog if you look Filipino, so if you're Ilocano, brace yourself. The food lines goes by pretty quickly, unless you order something that's from the kitchen. They recently expanded the front area so there are more seats.", "Date": "2016-08-04", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
