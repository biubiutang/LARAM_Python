With sub-standard service and long lines, the Vons on E.Tropicana is not the place to do a local shop. I usually visit anytime between 3pm and midnight and it's always the same.  When wal-mart is down the street and also cheaper, why bother with Vons? I have no idea personally.  A regional manager really needs to step in and kick some ass because this store is on a downward spiral.  I vote it 1/5. You cannot mark up your prices AND offer crummy service.

The place was being upgraded and they had to close down early for a few weeks, maybe a month, but after that, the place is great! it is always clean, the staff is still awesome, the security guards are very nice about walking people to their cars if they need to, and everything is easy to find.   Vons prices are pretty fair to me. I use my rewards card and the price gets knocked down even more, got to love that! The wine and other booze is pretty cheap then most places I know. Plus, a great selection as well. So many choices, so many wines to taste!   The surrounding population that may come to Vons can be a bit creepy, but overall I feel safe walking here from the University when I need to grab some stuff or even a cup of their soup they make on a daily basis.

I believe Vons are overpriced for the most part. That being said I can honestly give this vons 3 stars because of their staff.  Every cashier I encounter is very nice friendly. The people in the deli and produce are helpful and people always ask me if I need help finding something. As far as the cleanliness goes I don't think people understand that this store has been around for a while it seems. While Vegas has boomed and the majority of the stores have been built in the past decade, this store still looks pretty great for its age. It's nice to see Vons redoing a store instead of closing them down and letting walmart take over the city. I haven't been in the back of this store, but I can tell you that Vons have the cleanest stores out of the big chains by a mile. I worked for a beer vendor so I have been in probably 75% of the big chain grocery stores around town and Vons are always very neat and orderly.   The staff definitely saves the vons review for me because honestly with no bakery and alot of items that are priced high or priced with gimmicks it would of been a bit lower.", "Date": "2011-09-13", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jessica", "ReviewID": "bPrSkbgtSRyI4-KqXBFTgg", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Fuck CAROL that stupid bitch who works there!!!!!!

Located at the intersection of Maryland & Tropicana and less than ten minutes from the airport, strip, and two minutes from UNLV.  The shopping center has centered itself seems to be on it's last leg.Inside the store is dingy, dark, and generally unwelcoming.   The bakery/ deli section consists mainly of a few shelves of baked goods/ cold cuts with a limited selection.

My sister and I went here (5/31/11) to grab some food between classes. It's really not that far of a walk from UNLV, but it's still in a shady area. Going inside, we were looking for two things - something we could eat on the fly, and Perrier.   There's like... 5 separate aisles that drinks are located in this place. I spent a good 25 minutes going all around this place looking for any carbonated water. The water is across from the chardonnay, the Perrier is behind a box of house brand chips and below the energy drinks, which are across from a refrigerated case, juice is in a completely different section of the store. You get the idea.  The selection for everything is super limited. After spending, no joke, a good 45 minutes, we ended up getting so-so salads and a grapefruit Perrier - without the card $11, with one $9. Um, still overpriced on the salads. Frankly, Smith's is a better deal and they have way more selection.

I wasn't around before the remodel, so I can only base my review on what it currently looks like.  Prices are standard for a grocery, though I've found that their organic items tends to be a tad more pricey than other normal groceries. This Vons has a  darker  feel to it, though I think they were going for a natural-light feel.  As mentioned, this Vons location is very close to UNLV. I see students going here often. I usually go after class to pick up some groceries or whatnot. A few times I had went while carrying my backpack. I got some hassle today from an employee there about my backpack. It's just a small backpack, and I wasn't carrying a purse. :\  I noticed today that they had new products in their small gluten free section. I love that they have been rotating their stock, but I noticed that they don't have any Bakery on Main items anymore! That was one of the reasons I went to this Vons location (besides it being near UNLV). They had in the past always carried Bakery on Main's cranberry granola.

Just seriously.... REALLY??  This Vons may be in a slightly  ghetto  area of town, but the store is perfectly fine and the staff is incredibly nice. In fact, the only reason this Vons could be considered  ghetto  is because of the snippy college students frequenting it for their beer runs and mini-fridge stuffing.  Any time I have ever run into this store on the way home from work I have been asked if I needed help finding something and the cashiers are friendly too.  If you think this Vons is  ghetto  please go and visit the K-Mart on Bonanza and Nellis. PUH-LEASE! Get it together people. This store is remodeled, ya, it's kind of old, but at least it is clean.

That's not saying I wasn't sketched out. I came here by myself during the day to pick up water after my flight, and I wouldn't do that at night. I'd probably drive the extra mile, but this is the closest grocery store to my hotel that isn't in the direction of the Strip (aka traffic).  Water should be relatively easy to find, but surprisingly it was not stocked with the other non-alcoholic beverages that I have seen in every other Smith's, Walmart, Safeway, Ralph's, Albertsons, even other Vons. I had to ask, and it was tucked away hidden in the liquor aisle. Also, this is a small store probably just a convenience for students but with limited variety/selection. Reminds me of the Smith's two blocks away from UNM for that reason.  Wait wasn't bad at all. Josie was a very efficient cashier. She pointed out that my six-pack of water bottles had only five in them, but that was because I had gotten so thirsty that I had already opened one while shopping.

My sister and I went here on a Monday night to get stuff for our hotel rooms. Their produce wasn't the best, in fact all of the cucumbers were very soft and on the verge of going bad. The lettuce was browning and the fruit looked like it was all on its last leg. Anyway, we needed to get some butter as my sister's husband likes bagels with butter in the morning. Well, I guess the section where the butter is kept broke down and they had to take all of it off the shelves. Like I said, ghetto! I guess they didn't have any in the back either.   When we went to check out they had 1 lane open with a line about 10 people deep.

I've never had to pass through a turn-style to get into a grocery store - what exactly is that about? I understand the neighborhood is a bit on the sketchy side, but I've also never seen an entire aisle locked with gates - you need to have an employee unlock the gate if you need anything in the personal care aisle.  Maybe this shouldn't be held against the store in general, but it gives me a weird vibe.    While I was checking out, the cashier initiated a conversation about the economy and recession, making comments that not everybody can afford groceries anymore and how her personal financial troubles caused her home to lose value, etc.  She seemed very angry.  While I can definitely sympathize, it made me totally uncomfortable.", "Date": "2012-05-24", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Joshua", "ReviewID": "wKmsarF3Qknq2QMxWDxdlw", "Overall": "2", "Content": "A lot of other reviewers point out that this location is somewhat run-down, and frequented by  colorful  individuals. While I can appreciate that it's near a university and any neighborhood market in Vegas if going to have its share of seedy characters, this location doesn't have its act together enough to make me feel all right about their practices. I've been to this location twice; once, I asked if I could leave my backpack at the customer service desk, and several employees, including a manager, looked at me funny. I take the bus everywhere, so I always carry a pack and I'm used to leaving it up front, and I thought it strange that they seemed unused to the practice. The second visit yielded two security personnel who started to approach me even before I'd crossed the threshold, one of whom asked me to leave my bag (which I already had halfway off). Basically, it was the exact opposite of the last visit. Having a backpack policy is understandable, but irregular enforcement is not. The men's room smelled, had but one soap dispenser, no paper towels, and a floor that did not appear to have been cleaned that day. The restrooms are also located in the back, behind a door, in what is literally part of the stockrooms. Added to the fact that Vons/Safeway has higher prices than Smith's/Kroger, and you've got a store I'm not likely to return to.", "Date": "2014-10-04", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Isabel", "ReviewID": "ScG0fZJi2l6tn4FjNca25A", "Overall": "2", "Content": "So everybody is pretty much well aware that this Vons isn't located in the best location. That we can deal with. We can secure our things and make sure that we don't leave our valuables unattended and visible in the car.

I understand that sometimes situations happen and you might need cash for gas but after hearing that same story in the same parking lot over five times, I'm pretty sure it's time for either people to add gas before heading grocery shopping OR it's time for Vons to instill some better security in their parking lot.  Service, I mean, eh. They try their best. They accommodate long lines by opening another line when it gets too long. They assist you in finding your items. The typical.

I had a perfectly good rain check for some eggs and the girl made a big deal because the guy didn't specify brown eggs. I've never even seen white eggs by the brand I buy! So after telling me I have to wait for them to check for white eggs,  which took a good ten minutes,  we have to stand in front of everybody checking out and wait.  They then come back and say there are no white ones only brown.  Then this idiot,  makes us wait a good five more minutes to get her manager,  just for her to say it's okay and gave us the SAME eggs we originally had! So now we have waited 20 minutes to purchase the same eggs they told us we couldn't get! The only good thing from this trip,  was that this idiot cashier who I think is named Yvonne, rang in some produce incorrectly so I saved a few bucks!
