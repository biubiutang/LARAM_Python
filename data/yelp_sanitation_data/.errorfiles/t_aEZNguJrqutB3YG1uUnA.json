This granted us an option of a $30 all-you-can-drink wristband or a free drink.  Go for the wristband. I live in San Francisco, where a $4 well drink has the effect of about 8 drinks at Share. Bartenders were kinda... meh. I mean, drinks came pretty fast, but they sucked, and the guys serving them didn't have fun personalities.  The gogos... were they even gay? Beautiful bodied men who had absolutely no game, or dancing chops. Sort of lazily shaking their asses and asking guys if they want private shows. The GIRLS though! Yes! So much great energy.   Share managers: I spent $5 tipping your girl dancers and a bartender for my free drink. The rest of my drinks came from my friend, who bought a wristband. Do something.... different if you want people to spend a bunch. Make it more welcoming? Fun? You have so many guys on staff - tell them how to be friendlier and build a community.

Never a cover charge. Drinks are strong but I will admit drinks are rather pricey here. $9 for a well drink. But it's worth it for the music, no cover, and lots of gogo boys.  Gogo boys- tip them we'll, they will keep coming and throwing their dicks in your face. yum!!! $20 for a lap dance. Can't beat that, and yes your hands can go anywhere they want (an added bonus)  Bottle service-$200 we'll worth it. It's a bottle of sky so nothing big, but split between 5 or more people it's worth it cuz your going to spend more on drinks anyway, and bottle service gets you access upstairs to a private VIP lounge where any celebrities are.  Stay away from the female blonde, bartender in the front bar at the door (she's the only female bartender) It's a small bar that no one even notices, and I know why. She makes her drinks in this big clean plastic cup, and measures one shot per drink. Really bitch? That's 80 percent ice and juice. She was a Dumas. She didn't even know what a vodka cran was. Hello I'll give you a hint, vodka cran has 2 ingredients, and the 2 ingredients are in the name of the drink. Fuckin idiot.

Upon arrival, we got in free-- maybe the time? Who knows! But haaaay, free entrance fee right? Well, it turns out that there was not a lot of people there. The music was pretty on point with Top 40 hits, the crowd was mostly locals-- and that's all I could remember. On top of that, the location of this place is sketch[dot]org-- aka off from the strip.  Being a tourist, I really expected better. I came out all sorts of fresh, with dress shirt, bowtie, and all-- while locals just roll on in with jeans and a t-shirt. I thought it was some fancy Vegas club, but I guess not. On top of that, we were there for two-ish hours hoping it'd pick up some more people, but we decided to bounce ~1AM.  On the brighter note, there was an AMAZING drag show-- it was like front row seats to RuPaul's Drag Race LipSync for your life edition.  Overall, I can see this place growing-- if more gays came out that night. The dance floor was huge, the drinks were strong, and the music was pretty dope!

It's out off the strip and don't be surprised when you get that feeling that the Taxi Driver will kill you and dump your body somewhere because Share is in a very dark area; looks a bit sketchy too. I always find it a bit odd when they try to sell bottle service at gay clubs; aint nuttin classy about a gay club where guys are in tank tops and just trying to score a bj in the bathroom.   I had loads of fun dancing by myself, while my buddies were enjoying their drinks on the sidelines. One thing that really annoys me is when the bartenders charge different prices. This time, the bartenders charged different prices for each of us. 3 different people, same drinks, same prices. Also, same drinks, same bartender, same person, different price. There's no consistency or regulating this. The drinks were strong, which is always a good thing.

The police could raid the establishment and demand everyone's IDs. (This like never happens).  The ID had a picture and a birthdate, and my friend had no problem using it elsewhere.

There are gogo dancers everywhere.  The vibe is cool.  Lots of good looking people.  All in all I had a great time and a lot of fun!  I don't quite like the location.  This trendy and upscale nightclub is located amongst and industrial area and soooo awkward.  Thank goodness they have free valet service.    ***Be advised, Fridays get crazy at 1am and 2am.  Depends what you're going there for.  The gogo dancers, from what I was told are all imported from L.A. LOL. Definitely good looking, but they end up getting naked (covers up the front part) at 1 and 2.  I wasn't expecting it and since they're everywhere, it got super uncomfortable.  I'm all for having a great time, but wasn't looking for that kind of great time last night.  I also do not like the upscale prices.  3 well drinks with tip came to $34.

Now for my review:  What happens when one of your gay bff wants to go dancing on a Saturday night? You go! No one in our crowd was a fan of Krave and my bff suggested Share since it's his favorite one in town. Our group: A straight couple, my gay bff, two straight guys, and myself... WE ALL ENDED UP HAVING A BLAST!  I lucked out and was able to get a parking spot behind the club; everyone else was parked on the streets. The bouncers at the door were friendly and told all of us to have a wonderful time with a genuine smile. The club is very clean since they handle spills immediately and there are staff walking around to pick up any cans/cups on the ground. The crowd is also very friendly with people actually apologizing when they bump into you.   We got our drinks from the bar (about $10 each) and ended up in the middle of dance floor. I love this club purely for the fact that everyone is there to legitimately dance and I'm not talking about giving someone your ass, but DANCING! I dance battled a couple of gay boys and let me tell you, they had some moves! I sang along to all of the songs and danced the night away.  To the man in the Obey hat and white tank top there on 05/24/14: I'm sorry that I kept blocking you when you tried to dance up on one of my boys, but trust me, he wasn't interested.  Downstairs, there are a few poles for the beautiful male and female go-go dancers to do their thing and bottle-service tables are right next to them. There are even a few performances on the stage throughout the night so it gets switched up.  Upstairs, this is where the private lap dances are held.

I've returned to Share a few times since the last review- Yes the lay out of the dance floor is lame, but the go- go dancers are amazing and have fun with the crowd!!  Friday nights I would say is the best as they have a Circus Theme going on. Upstairs you can through some dildos and try to win stuff and the dancers are hot wearing only a white towels around them! Music has improved, they now play songs you know and can dance too.  Drinks are still over priced- well drinks are expensive compare to Piranha. Crowd is mixed and they have a very good security team that are friendly to customers, and aware of people that might get out of control!  Very sexy guys that try to get you for private dance upstairs- if you have the money you won't be Disappointed!!!   Just right off the strip cab rides should be much cheaper than going to Krave   They run specials on VIP tables on some nights.", "Date": "2013-08-13", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Rafael", "ReviewID": "dB7t7yXYxHF6Re-Fs4JoYw", "Overall": "1", "Content": "I was witness to a situation this past Saturday night that changed my opinion of this club completely. As gay men and women we get enough discrimination from people out there to also get it from gay establishments like this nightclub. I was with a group of friends and one of the guys in the group was carrying a passport ID card with him instead of a driver's license. The bouncer decided it was a good opportunity of him to make some extra cash, so he told they guy that he needed to see the passport that went along with the ID card. The guy explained that he had been able to get into other clubs with the same card with no problem. The bouncer then said that not at this club and you all need to go to the side and discuss how much it means for you all to get into this club. When he was offered some money, the bouncer stated that this was Las Vegas and you need to rethink the offer. It was then that our whole group just decided to leave and go to another nightclub where this kind of discrimination and extortion doesn't happen. I hope the manager of this place reads this and does something about it and if he already knows this goes on in his club, shame on you. I'll think twice before returning to Share.

I spent one weekend with some friends in Vegas for my birthday and we decided to come here one night.  I was warned that there will be some strippers that will almost force you to buy a lap dance from them.  Sure enough, about 15 minutes in, a couple of half naked dancers dragged us up to the second floor so that they can give us a  tour  of the place.  Well apparently they run a pretty tiny club since we went directly to a small room that's only closed off by a see through curtain.  Everything then happened so fast.  My friends paid, left and within minutes I got a half naked Cuban dancer dancing on top of me asking me if I would tip well if he were to show me his pee pee.  I didn't say anything and in 15 minutes it was over... much like a Grindr hookup.  The biggest difference though is that a Grindr hookup wouldn't cost $100 like the lap dance did.  Leaving the barely private room though did feel like a walk of shame so in that sense it did feel kind of a like a hookup.  Luckily I was able to join my friends downstairs for some drinks and dancing so the night didn't end that badly.  When I got back to LA I told the story to some of my straight friends and they said that a lap dance would cost 3X as much at a straight club so I was actually getting a bargain!

Again as other Yelpers said, it's best to go with a group so you can have a good time.  - Expect it to be kind of empty. - Expect some good dancy upbeat pop/hiphop music. - Expect the drinks to be around $10 (not bad for Vegas IMO) - Expect some hottie gay-for-pay dancers that will probably spend more time hitting on your hag than trying to get your attention. - Expect to awkwardly avoid sexual advances from the Vegas locals (they are aggressive and can bite, unless you like that) - Expect to be standing the entire time (because the empty seats are reserved for bottle service, which NO ONE is paying for) - Expect to leave happy you experienced it, but somewhat disappointed.
