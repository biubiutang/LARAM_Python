Sometimes when I eat here, I still can't believe how dumb I was not to realize it.   In any case, Sushi Koma is a solid AYCE sushi option on the Westside. Parking is plentiful, but seating is not. You are a bit cramped and close to other tables. We had a table for 8 here and had to maneuver a lot to get in and out of our seats, so for larger parties I'd recommend Oyshi instead. One thing I do appreciate about Sushi Koma over other AYCE places is they have yet to mess up my order and food does come out fairly quickly. I'm never worried if they forgot to put an order in. I just tried their hand rolls for the first time last week, and I'm definitely a fan. Their sushi I would say is a bit lesser in quality and freshness than Sushi House Goyemon, but still solid. I think they inflate the prices for non-AYCE so it's always better to just go ahead and get AYCE. I wish they had a few more interesting dessert options than ice cream and mochi, but at the end, I'm always too stuffed to eat a big dessert anyway. My husband is a fan of the Big B roll - baked sushi roll topped with beef, while my favorite baked roll is the Volcano roll.", "Date": "2014-11-13", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Katherine", "ReviewID": "Pd5xrMoGw8Ilntu9no-TsQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I've been here twice, once when it was Sushi Freak and another time recently.  They've improved from the last time I've been here.  I remember not liking their specialty appetizers because they just didn't work for me.  But now they taste pretty good.  The tuna carpaccio is drowning in sauces and fried garlic that I don't taste any fish, but the sauce and garlic go very well together.  For their sashimi roll, I remember I didn't like it because it was pretty much piece of fish stuck inside a thick piece of radish. Now they slice the radish very thin so that it doesnt overpower the fish in their roll.  The changes they've made to their appetizers turned me into a fan of Sushi Koma.    Some rolls were a hit or miss.  My friends and I really liked the Kimmi and Big B roll.  We didn't enjoy the Fish Paradise or Pania roll. The nigiri was delicious!  The salmon had a  fluffy, melts in your mouth  consistency, as my friend puts it, and we couldn't stop ordering more.  And the rice:fish ratio was perfect!  The servers are really friendly and since the restaurant is really small (I think there were about 6 tables and the bar) it feels very intimate and it's not too loud.    *they have exotic flavored mochi like coffee and green tea!", "Date": "2013-09-22", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Minnie", "ReviewID": "sAMsPZUCA4TR0QVGtHgwaw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "A dimly lit sushi joint for the late nights with your friends that like to stuff their faces with oddly named rolls. Let me make it clear right now that, 98% of the time, I will never suggest going out to eat for sushi, but this was a special occasion and my friends chose to have AYCE sushi here on a Friday night.  The Arrival: The wait wasn't too long at all for my party of eight. Yes, eight! I'm guessing we got very lucky!  Sweet!  I thought.  Seated so soon? Love this place already.  NOTE: I would also like to note that it says they take reservations here on Yelp, but I don't think they do.  The Folks Running This Place: Everyone was very friendly, but not all of them were knowledgeable of what the menu items were. Some looks were exchanged on the names of certain orders, but that was solved almost immediately. I wouldn't remember all of them either, if I worked there. This would be a good place to add that their menu selection is extensive! So many weird names to remember! I also asked one of the servers for a recommendation, my table loved it and we ended up ordering another.  The Overall Atmosphere: It'll seem crowded because of the size of the room. People are talking, music is playing, orders are flying out consistently, and the whole place is alive. It's all good.  The Grub: I'm not a sushi lover, but I enjoyed several of the options here, and am the kind of person who is always willing to try everything. My sushi-loving friends enjoyed their food wholeheartedly ordering one after another. Our empty plates would pile high at the end of the table.  ***Here are some menu items we would recommend: seafood tostada, lemon eight roll, ninja roll, mussels, Vegas roll, salmon nigiri and the tuna carpaccio you've probably read about on here about a hundred times is definitely worth a try.  Anyway, they've got my stars. Nothing went wrong, we were treated well, and nearly everything I tried was delicious.

We were probably waiting 20-30 min in between each order which half of them were actually delivered. The fish was not fresh, tasted like it came straight from the freezer and was thawed out.

My eyes were WAY bigger than my stomach.  Under 30 bucks is a sweet price for AYCE quality sushi.  Sake, Ama Ebi, Maguro and Hamachi nigiri were the best orders of the meal.  Uni was also pretty good.  Well this *is* the desert, so you cannot expect something like that to remain spankin' fresh, all the way from whatever port it travels.  And I was told it is driven in from L.A.  Tekka Maki, Sashimi roll, Tuna carpaccio were fine.  For the money, should have just continued with nigiri.  Over-did it though with the Elephant, Ponzio and Spider rolls. *bleurggh*  Service was biased :-\ not that warm and welcoming.. at least not to moi.

I actually wasn't that hungry but it's been a while since I've ate made to order AYCE sushi so why not it was only $26 for dinner. My order was only a small portion of the menu but easily would have cost me more than $26. I had some shrimp tempura, deep fried oysters, octopus nigiri, elephant roll, red bean ice screen, plus whatever else we shared and some specialty items the sushi chef made for us.  Overall the food was very good but because I didn't try more of the menu it's a 4 which is still very good in my book.  Next time I'm coming hungry.  Service was excellent, the main reason for the 5 rating.  We came with a party of 7 and Sushi Freak accommodated us very well. There was no wait. They were on the spot with bringing all of our orders out quickly and correct, separating bills and taking our money.  They made specialty items just because and said we didn't have to finish them if we didn't like it.  Don't remember how long we were there but they didn't rush us.  They also treated us like their number ones from when we first arrived till we left, excellent first impression.  Definitely will be back.

There was nobody except us (group of 5). The menu was unexciting, full of rolls and baked stuff, which we didn't order. We were all nigiri or raw fish fans. We all opted for the AYCE lunch and ordered some nigiris to start with, and the waitress apologized as there was only one chef and the other was late. We were very understanding, but as we waited and waited for our food, we couldn't understand why it was taking so long. We were the only people in there and they just opened, and we only ordered nigiri, which is just raw fish and rice! It took 20 minutes to get our orders, and most of our 1 1/2 lunch was spent sitting around waiting for food. It would be okay if the food was good, but the fish wasn't fresh or exciting. The fish tasted bland and tasteless. Salmon was off color. Tasted more like something from a very mediocre sushi restaurant, which I think this was. I will never go back again.

They have stamp cards, which entices us to come back because once you get 10 stamps, you will win a grand prize of eating one free ayce meal! We tried pretty much everything on the menu and haven't been disapointed. Also, if you don't want to order a whole roll and want to attempt to try everything on the menu, ask them to do half rolls. Half rolls are 4 pieces, so you don't fill up so quickly on just one roll of 8 pieces,  The service is impeccable and the waitresses are incredibly friendly.

We were sat right away and opted for AYCE, ordering round one once we received menus that were forgotten upon our arrival. We started with salmon, yellowtail, and super white tuna and chatted about life and work while waiting for our fish, though it appeared that nobody else was and were receiving theirs punctually.   Thinking service was pushed back due to the filling dining room, we stopped another server and ordered another round of uni, masago, and amaebi, requesting that the shrimp heads be fried, before round one touched down. Nope - these items came out almost as soon as we ordered it, so we stopped not one, but two servers, to inquire about the first couple of items. The servers assured us that it was  on the way,  but everything about the timing and operation just seemed out of whack. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to leave feeling like I was in a  k oma (ugh, by the way, I hate replacing c-words with a  k ), or if the communication between the servers was comatose. Sorry,  k omatose.   I do have to say, though, that the girls working the dining room are very personable, all things said. If any one of them has her own station, we certainly didn't see it - at any time we were able to place orders with anyone, and everyone came by to inquire about us and refill our beverages.

I usually don't order rolls when I do ayce, but this place really has some awesome rolls, like the fish paradise.
