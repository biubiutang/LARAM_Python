Drove 30 min to get there from way across town. Huge waste of time. They should have been open another 3 hours. We even went earlier than the other people that complained about them closing early, figuring they'd still be open this early on a Friday night. Nope!  We all only went there because we were curious. Normally we go to Zen curry across the street.  Well, back across the street we went. At least their hours are dependable and they never let us down.   Not sure if we'll ever go out of our way again for these guys.   But if you look at their other negative yelp reviews they have a bad bad habit of jerking around customers regarding their hours.  Apparently early sudden closure happens a lot.  If you really want to go, call first I suppose and hope they keep their word. They could actually have great food!

Kaba Curry manages to mix both the flavors of Hawaiian and Japanese curry. The great thing about Kaba is that you basically build your own plate of curry. It starts out with rice and curry base and you add on things like Chicken Karaage, Sausage, Spam, Beef, etc etc.    The portion size is quite generous and the staff is quite sociable and friendly. Kaba Curry can quickly change from a quick dine in to  regular stop. I can surely say, I'm glad i have become a regular here.

Our little family walked in an hour and a half before closing and all we saw was a HUGE group of guys waiting for their meal. And when I say huge, I mean they took up like half the restaurant. I knew we were going to have somewhat of a wait because there were no plates in front of them. There wasn't a sign that said to seat yourself, so we waited by the counter. There was a man behind the counter talking to another man (one of the patrons) and I'd say it took a good FIVE minutes for him to even acknowledge us..... and we were standing right in front of him. My boyfriend gave me the  let's just walk out  look but this place has been blasting my IG newsfeed so I wanted to see the hype.   When we were finally able to order, there was a list of stuff they had ran out of, so we had to rethink our decisions. (ugh) We waited a good 20-25 minutes for our food but it was nice and piping hot. The curry was OK. I think we prefer Indian curry so it may just be a preference thing. My BF ate the food, but I don't think he'll want to eat it again. The concept is great and they offer very creative toppings and sides to go along with the curry, but like I said, it may just be a preference thing. I would give the food a 3/4 but have to downgrade to a 2 because of the initial service.

Ambiance: 3/5 About 5 booth style seating options, and 2 random two top tables with what looked like a DJ set up near the entrance.   I honestly didn't get the vibe or the concept of the decor if there was any. During our wait time, it felt more like a frat house than anything.   Food: 4/5 We ordered the custom curry dishes with spice levels 2-3. The portion of rice is more than generous to be quite honest (previous comments stated the portion was small).  The flavor was amazing, and the chicken was Full Of Flavor and juicy. Presentation had nothing going but it didn't matter much as I devoured the dish completely.  I noticed a family sat down after we did and immediately got back up and left. FYI it's a custom curry style restaurant with a small section of non curry items. For the most part it's all curry built how you like.   Service: 3/5 Based on the reviews I'm going to assume the gentleman working the front of the house is the owner and there's a one man show in kitchen, which is probably why the food took longer than usual to come out. The gentleman was very nice and sincere about a few items on the menu not being available.   I over heard a family near us order their Roti Canai which didn't come till the end of their meal. Down the road at Malaysian Island Cuisine, their Roti Canai came out quick.    Overall, don't expect much.

But we were in search of something quick before our movie date. Because Kaba Curry just opened their new location, we figured we give it a try. They are located in the same shopping center as the original SF Supermarket. Their exact location is the 2nd floor next to Bazic and hidden behind the staircase.  No official large signage anywhere yet.   They have a temporary menu right now which consists of putting together your own curry plate. We went for the staple of Curry & Rice ($4.99) and added one side - Spam Katsu ($1), which is 1 slice.  You can choose your spice level as well.   Our dish didn't take too long and we woofed it down. We were probably in and out within 15 minutes. There was one party of 2 there before us and a couple of singles that arrived after.  Overall, we were pleasantly surprised with the curry. It had a deep flavor and had the Husband and I rethinking Japanese curry.  Sides range from Ground Beef to Deep Fried Tofu to Tonkatsu from $1 to $3.  Toppings range from Corn to Spinach to Cooked Egg from 50 cents to 75 cents.  I guess most people choose a few sides and toppings to round out their dish.  Good to know for future reference.  Free topping with Yelp check-in! (They just started this a day or two after we went!)  Side note: When we paid with our credit card on the Ipad, we didn't see a spot to add a tip to our total.

I got the udon curry with just egg and rakkyo. Overall the current was decent, but there was a little too much cumin flavor for me. I do like it with the udon and while I went really plain it stood up well alone. The BF said his loco moco was okay. Mac salad was plentiful and was well made. I was STILL hungry though after eating. I ate a full bahn mi after and got shaved snow immediately after leaving. Not good. I could have ordered more here, but the wait did not lead me to want to get dessert or extra sides.   I understand with there being large groups there would be some wait, but I just noticed how it was not really efficient. Things were coming out one by one, so I don't think they are doing line procedure in assembling and expediting. Like at our table there was 3 loco mocos and 2 curry udons. You would think all the locos come out together, the udons come out together, etc.   The first moco was halfway done and the next two arrived a few minutes apart....then my udon came and the BF asked about their side of macaroni. The BF was at a few bites left of his moco before the mac salad came. After all the loco mocos were eaten, finally Christina got her udon which was cold but the gyoza was warmer so they probably had it sitting waiting on the fried gyoza. Most people were saying that one part of their meal was hot while the other was cold. My egg was hot, noodles warm. This feels like a timing issue. A few people at my table who have been here before have said food takes a long time here, even in their previous visits.  Curry is made in large batches, the sides are made to order for it. 90minutes of a meal just seemed a bit long for our 2 tables plus a few people at the bar and one group of 3 in the restaurant.   The waitress was nice enough.   It's alright. I think I prefer curry elsewhere. I did like the udon curry noodles, but that is not a 1 hour 10 minute wait worthy food.

The last time was when they were at the food court on Charleston. It was finally getting cold here in Vegas, so it was the perfect time to eat curry and visit the new location. I'm glad that they have an actual restaurant now, because let's be honest here, that food court was deserted and kind of sad. I was a little disappointed not to see the friendly faces of Anthony and Maki when we walked in. They were always present at the old location.   The menu had changed quite a bit, but in a good way. It was nice to see more options for sides and toppings, as well as some new desserts. Now you can also choose spice levels, which doesn't apply to me since I stay away from spicy foods, but I know that people like to have the option.  The restaurant was clean and spacious. The employees were friendly and attentive. Our food came out quickly and the Chicken Katsu was still as awesome as before. My only complaint? Well, maybe two. First, the temperature of the curry was disappointing. No, I don't want my curry to be boiling hot, but I definitely don't want it to be at room temperature either. Yes, it was that bad. I guess it was partly my fault because I could have complained. But on the other hand, I didn't know these employees. What if they got mad about me complaining and spit in my food? LOL totally kidding. But seriously, lukewarm curry does not taste good! This second one is more of a suggestion than a complaint. It would really be nice if they had brown rice as an option, even if there was an extra charge for it.   They have a  frequent grubbers card  so make sure you ask for one if they forget to offer it to you.  2 stamps = a free drink 4 stamps = a free side 7 stamps = a free meal!

They have a very casual vibe here.  Clean setup, nice atmosphere, and the friendly staff goes well with the good food served here.  My fav so far has been the Curry Rice ($11): Tonkatsu, Kaarage, and Fried Egg. I asked for the  spicy  curry, and it packs a punch! It was only a little bit spicy in my book, but there was TONS of flavor! My favorite Japanese CURRY so far.  I would say the Tonkatsu was passable though, as well as the Kaarage.  I think the best sides so far have been the Chicken Katsu and Kurobuta Sausage personally.  Also tried the Curry Cheese Fries ($12-13): Chicken Katsu, Kurobuta Sausage, Corn and Mushrooms. This was much different but tasty! Recommended if you want to try something new in a less traditional sense.  We have also tried the Curry Udon, which is essentially udon noodles with a curry broth.  It is thin enough to drink as a soup without being overpowering.  The flavor is good, but the combination was a little different.  Give it a try if you are looking for something different.  And to finish, we got to try the Pumpkin Kaba Cakes. These were pretty awesome! They steam the cakes here, so they come out super moist, rich, and delicious!

When we walked in there were a few people seated at the bar, and two other tables, but it didn't seem busy. We weren't sure if we seated ourselves or not, and w weren't greeted so we just sat at an open table.   It took a little while before we were even acknowledged, but the server was apologetic and got us started with drinks. Unfortunately, when we ordered the server came back and told us they were sold out and that we had to reorder. After changing my order, I ended up getting the standard Katsu Curry and added a fried egg. When we ordered the server warned us there was only one cook, and that service would be a little slow. I didn't mind at first, but after over an hour of waiting, I started to wonder if we should go elsewhere. They did give us some jello straws to snack on while we waited, I appreciated the gesture, but didn't really care for the jello.  Once we got our food, I was a little disappointed with the portion size. As far as taste, the curry was flavorful and the katsu was cooked well. It was tasty, but not worth waiting over an hour for.    They gave us a complimentary dessert for the excessive wait time, a chocolate cake with a Chantilly sauce.   I checked in on yelp and got my topping free which was nice. It's a bit pricey considering how much you food you get. I did like how customizable their menu was, but the combinations add up quickly. Without any extras, and the free topping deal, my Katsu Curry was $9.  The food was okay, but the slow service was disappointing.

So lets start off with the good. Taste of the food? Pretty good. Very similar to most Japanese restaurant's curry. Whatever is fried stayed crispy. Nothing bad, but nothing extraordinary either.   Service was good.  I felt like their prices were a little high considering their portion sizes. Everyone knows that everything in Hawaii is more expensive than the mainland. However, I could get the same curry plate that's double the portion, still for cheaper than kaba curry. Simple things like just adding a little more rice or more curry sauce would just  make  the plate look fuller and make customers feel like they're getting a great deal. Rice and sauce are the most inexpensive things in a restaurant so I don't feel like people need to be stingy with those. Just a little comparison: at ichiza their beef curry is around $8 (loaded with beef, vegetables, and rice) and I can never finish it all and always have some lunch for tmrw as well. Here...I paid the same price for basically just curry sauce, rice, and katsu and I cleaned the plate off and still felt hungry.   The atmosphere here can get super awkward as well! I don't wanna offend ppl into that  cosplay  world but....I felt like this restaurant was a mini convention for that! Everyone in there were in bright colored wigs, dressed up like anime, or playing magic cards! It wasn't even Halloween! We were the only  normal  customers there. It was just awkward! And it seems like they're the friends of the owners too cuz they even go behind the counter freely. I felt like I was in another world and I just wanted to finish my food and leave. I mean, if you're into those kinda things or you don't mind that the place is packed with cosplay ppl then sure maybe you'll like the atmosphere. But it wasn't for me.   I'll stick to ichiza.

Environment is neat with dim lighting and the kitchen being out there. Seating is pretty limited, but the place seems slow enough to the point where over crowding shouldnt be a problem.  Im not going to ignore the fact that Curry Zen is nearby. They both have good curry, but Zen seems like it has bigger portions at a better price. Its probably rude to mention competition on Yelp, but theres no ignoring it.  Pros: its japanese curry, service is good, and the people are welcoming  Cons: portions dont seems much for its price  Advice: I feel like itll be too rude to say it, so I wont.

I heard so much about this place that I decided to give it a try.  Thursday night and this place was not busy whatsoever. We were able to take a seat wherever we liked and received very fast service. Unfortunately some of the things on the menu were being discontinued and the prices of fountain drinks were being raised, but our server kindly informed us all of this. He didn't rush us at all while taking our order and was very patient with us - something I greatly appreciate when receiving customer service.   As we were waiting for our food, we were able to play tic-tac-toe on the tabletops. I thought this was pretty cool and an innovative way to keep people busy as they wait for their food. The environment of this place is very casual and modern, and the atmosphere is very laid back.   As for the food, it was very delicious. I've only tried a few Japanese curry houses in Vegas, but this is honestly the best one I've been too. The curry tastes yummy, and there is a wide selection of toppings and sides you can get with your curry. You can even choose a spice level if you want. They even have a few already made dishes if you're feeling a bit indecisive for that day. Everything is pretty affordable too, so I would recommend this place for those who don't want to spend too much money for a decent meal. I do feel like the portions could be a bit bigger though since I ran out of curry before finishing all of my rice. It's not the best Japanese curry I ever had, for it's a bit of a thinner consistency. But for Vegas, it's a spot I would recommend.

Their food is primarily a mix of Hawaiian and Japanese ingredients - their curry being out of this world amazing, which is obviously where the title of the establishment comes in and what they are best known for.  They have just recently moved to their location as of current and unfortunately with where it is, you do sort of have to look for it, as it doesn't stick out.  They are in the process still of actually getting set up, so there are no markers or signs that stand out  upon entering the Plaza (the name which escapes me) in China Town.    I can be picky when it comes to food. I'm sure everyone can, especially certain Yelpers!  Let me tell you though, their place is exceptionally clean and the way Antony (the owner of Kaba) and Maki (the co-owner) create and prepare the food, it is divine.  They are both very sweet, friendly and down-to-earth.  They are more than willing to cater to your food-needs and make sure you are completely satisfied before you go.  This may be a  hole in the wall  dining experience, but they will definitely make you feel comfortable and at home - you'll become a regular, fast!  Their menu, to be flat out, is a little small.  What I do appreciate though is the simplicity of it.  Essentially, you make your own meal in a 'build your own plate' sort of fashion.  You have the base, your curry spice level, side dishes meant to go on the curry as well as your base choice and amount of  fun  as they put it.  The fun, meaning things such as kimchee, corn, cooked eggs and even Fukujinzuke which is pickled ginger.  Their portions are nice, not too much, not too little - it's how I really wish most food was prepared.  I hate having so much on my plate all of the time because I'm sorry, I have a medium sized stomach, not the stomach of a Sumo Wrestler!  Maki prepares the dishes so delicately, I'd trust my food in her care any day.    Overall, this place needs more publicity and more praise.

They have a tv which plays the same series of random anime and tuesday blend clips over and over.  The music they were playing gave me the impression that I was walking into some underground fight club which didn't bother me, just gave me a weird vibe.  They have japanese magazines with some business cards on a table in the middle of the restaurant which was cool.  I really enjoyed going through all the pictures in the magazine despite not being able to read it.   Food: I ordered the loco moco curry dish.  The dish itself was good HOWEVER, the curry was cold.  What I don't understand is how you can advertise yourself as a curry restaurant and to not even keep the curry at a good temperature really disappointed me.

Kaba's curry is a little bit watered down as if they use apple sauce to mild the curry (I hate when my mom did this). Shit I just realized I never let the girl know how hot I wanted it...maybe this was why the flavor was a little bit tangy which was different than what I am used to.   The Chicken Katsu was on point, the Chicken Karaage was as well. Probably the best Chicken Karaage in town in my opinion. If you don't know what it is it's basically a lighter fried chicken with flavor to it. The staple dish that I grew up on...If this place sold Chicken Karaage and the varieties that you can make Karaage this place would have got damn near 5 stars but we talking bout curry.  Like I mentioned the concept is cool, caters towards my generation and younger and has many items to add-on with. However in my PERSONAL OPINION the curry was a miss.

However, it was for a good cause as a group of Yelpers dined here after bringing donations for Typhoon Haiyan victims.

I can't help it. They just have great food. When you look for gems in Vegas, I think this is one of them in which I do believe that we need more of. There are so much mediocre food that gets more attention in this city that it pushes restaurants like these to the side. It's a shame.   So, typically I order the rice and curry with add ons of chicken karaage, chicken katsu, lumpia, spam, and marinated beef. Okay, I lied, I don't order them all at the same time, but I select three from those add ons, and you'll be sure to be satisfied by the end of your meal.   There curry isn't your traditional Japanese style that is super thick, and almost bland to the taste (sorry, maybe I've just compared this to bad curry-- Curry Zen). No, this curry POPS in your mouth. You're getting so much flavor in one bite that you can taste the spice, salt, and a hint of sweet all together. You can tell they spent so much time perfecting this curry because it's not just a simple one ingredient. It's a variety of ingredient put together to make something oh. so. delicious. So when you want Asian comfort food, this is the place to be!   In terms of service, it's quite a hit or miss for me. Often times, I come here when Ruka or Ancho are the servers because they know how to take care of you. I've gotten services from other people that just didn't really seem to know what they're doing or just really didn't want to be there. So, sometimes, the servers are what turns me off from not coming at all. Nevertheless, I don't want to base this rating on a few incidents of bad service because often times, I'm served by the two named above that are exceptional.   My advice, stick to the rice & curry. The fries are not the best ones as I feel that they are frozen and too fat to actually enjoy. The grilled sandwich is also a weird one because they use cheap white bread-- not a fan of those. Again, stick to their rice & curry. You go to Kaba Curry and eat their damn delicious sticky rice & curry. Because if you come here and rate them a one star for ordering a grilled cheese, or udon noodles with curry, that's like you telling me that you went to a breakfast restaurant and say you hate it because you ate their burger. Curry is eaten with rice. So stick to the rice and curry to really know their forte.   But, also, get their Chantilly for dessert. Dessert lovers like me won't be disappointed!
