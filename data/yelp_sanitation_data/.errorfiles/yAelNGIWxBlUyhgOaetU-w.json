It's in DT Summerlin. They have lots of sample of their tea throughout the store. And they can mix and match you whatever tea you want to order. And even better, the staff is really knowledgeable about their products and can make great recommendations. We enjoyed browsing, sampling, and talking with the two staffers. And they helped us create a very tasty iced tea blend. If you're a tea lover, you need to shop here. And be sure to take advantage of the knowledge of the staff. They won't steer you wrong with their recommendations.

I told a manager named Marino that I bought a Breville water kettle a few days back. He told me I should have got the $25 gift card with purchase and was surprised I did not get it. He said to bring back my receipt and he would give me the $25 gift card.   So I did what he said, I went back and got my receipt and when I went back to the store the same day he said that the $25 gift card was for a different machine. Well, wouldn't it be great customer service to ask which machine I got and be more specific if it were only certain machines that offered the $25 gift card? The entire situation would have never happened if he did asked just one simple question so that I would not waste my time coming back in the after Christmas chaos and crowds just to do what he promised me. I think this is careless and shows how much they devalue their customers. To me it is not about the $25, it is the principle that he offered information to me and then just dismissed the information he had just given me with no sincerity or care about the effort I made to do what he informed me to do. I don't appreciate people wasting my time and not seeming to care at all about what they said that was incorrect information.   What made things worse is when he sold me a tea which he claimed was excellent. I went home and took less than a teaspoon full because it actually did not appeal to me the more I smelled it. I mixed it with another tea to make a cup and threw it away. It was gross! I went back to return it and he rang me up for 3.5 oz when I bought 4 oz. How is it possible that I used .5 oz on one cup of tea when supposedly they claim 2 ounces is 20 plus cups of tea meaning .5 oz should be at least 5 servings?  It would have been a nice gesture as someone who suggested the tea and just made me drive to Teavana once out of my way just to bring a receipt and got nothing for it and now twice to return a tea he recommended. It would have been kind to return the amount I bought due to the amount of time and money I put into doing something by coming back and got nothing out of it. I came back because he assured me he would help me when I return. Instead he just said it's for a different tea maker and did nothing to apologize for my time he wasted and my gas money. I think that's a pretty awful way to take care of the situation. I would be more understanding if it's someone new, but a manager should know better!  I truly believe he scammed me and overcharged me for the tea and said it was 4 ounces when it wasn't. That is the only logical explanation. He also made mistakes with my other tea. It was crowded in there and everyone makes mistakes, but they should fix them when it is brought to their attention.   Unfortunately he has ruined my love for Teavana. This person is someone they put in management? Not the kind of company I want to give my hard earned money on. I don't want to pay to be treated that way.", "Date": "2014-12-29", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Amy", "ReviewID": "R7MckyPJbA25D5Dg4aASMA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I've been a Teavana addict for years now, ever since they opened their first shop in Utah. Now that I'm in Las Vegas, I'm so happy to see how many locations are close by.   The store itself is my happy place. The aroma of the different teas, the free samples, and the set up of the store is so aesthetically pleasing.   Youthberry is definitely a tried and true favorite of mine, but I've started branching out into Oolong and other teas. A few other favorites: Maharajah Chai, Precious White Peach, Passion Tango, and Peachberry Jasmine Sutra.  I bought myself a steeping tea thermos (18 oz) that I regularly make my tea in, but someday (and when I can decide on which, because they are all so stunning), I plan to buy myself a full iron kettle set with matching cups. Someday, someday...  There's something sweet about the idea of having solo tea parties (or even having friends over), having some awesome tea from Teavana, and also getting the health benefits. I like the homage paid to the tea parties I put together when I was little. Kind of a fun throw back, but on an adult level.  This particular location feels a bit smaller and compact compared with other Las Vegas locations, but the associates are so incredibly knowledgable about the preparation, origins, and pairing of their teas.", "Date": "2016-04-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Raphael", "ReviewID": "J8rBBmJMrE3TYsSc3X90rA", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Quite poor experience for my 1st time.   My girlfriend took me in to try some different teas but clearly the female (seemed new) & male with glasses and a man bun didn't know what they were doing because not only was the tea luke-warm and highly overly sweet, but the service when returning it for a new one was just plain rude. When asked about the types of tea, the man with the glasses took it upon himself to start naming at a rate of speed that no one could understand. Even his co-worker.   He didn't even take time to look at us he was so preoccupied in talking to the new girl working.   And when we returned the drink due to the fact it was bearly warm, they took it, added a small amount of hot water (still luke-warm afterwards) and went back to their conversation.  I'll make sure to never suggest this spot to anyone. It's a waste of money & a poor experience.

Ive been here 2 times since it opened. Both times were enjoyable... No employees outside asking every passer by if they want to try the tea (I know this is their job but I hate it! Maybe because I've probably tasted that and every other tea before? Maybe it just reminds me of those mall kiosks  ma'm let me see your hair! )  They're really nice and knowledgeable about pulling teas to try once they get a vibe of what you like... Ive gotten free iced teas brewed while I shop (although be warned I don't think they do this if you're buying like 10 bucks... both times I was restocking in the $80+ range).  They also haven been super pushy with buying the extra tin to keep your teas super fresh or buying rock sugar.   Minus one star for intentionally pouring more tea than I asked for (they sell by the ounce) and not asking if it was ok... I mean I asked for four oz. and the guy pours 5.5oz... its typically 5-15 dollars per 2oz. so keep your eye on the scale!", "Date": "2014-11-24", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Nelson", "ReviewID": "xA57r-v3T6x-v3-LAOkA5Q", "Overall": "5", "Content": "YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(365/365)  The Marino-meister   I was bummed when Teavana closed up shop at The Fashion Show Mall, but elated when I discovered that they found a new home in Downtown Summerlin! Passing by, This gentleman nicely greets us while handing us free samples of Youthberry/ Wild Orange Blossom and Maharaja Chai Oolong/Samurai Chai Mate tea blends which were nice and refreshing.  Oh we're not done yet, come on inside!  he says...  Stopping at each and every table, explaining to us anything and everything we wanted to know about Teavana-their tea sources, gift packages, assorted teapots, and other cool gadgets(while still offering samples inside...There are about 8-10 more!) at no time did we feel that Marino was that typical pushy salesperson. He was very thorough, informative and very courteous. Up front is where the fun begins with Marino. getting a feel for what flavors we like, he pulls from the 98 different loose leaf teas they have on the wall teas that he thought we may like as well as a few of his favorites, opening each tin and fanning the aroma towards us which was very intoxicating in a good way!  Two ounces is the minimum for buying any of their loose leaf teas, but prices vary(anywhere from $4 upwards to about $15) just a head's up so you don't get a serious case of sticker shock! No purchases on the wall of teas this time but I got a Iced Raspberry Limeade which I enjoyed while perusing the other shops at DTS. Go see Marino for a 5-star experience at Teavana!  ALOHA!!!

They have a wide variety of tea to choose from, and their workers are very friendly and informative. I drop by every time I come to Downtown Summerlin to have a few samples and occasionally get tea-to-go. Since Summer's here and it's burning hot, it's great to have a place where you can quickly swing by to grab a refreshing drink while shopping. Their tea sets & gadgets are also really pretty and useful if you're a tea lover.   My personal favorite is their Youthberry tea. It's perfect for a hot day because it's really refreshing like lemonade. It has a fruity taste to it which I find divine. Even my sister likes it and she's really picky when it comes to what fruits she likes to eat.  The layout of their store is really neat, along with it being organized and clean. It doesn't feel cramped inside (unless it's busy). Speaking of which, because of how much business they get, you'd think they'd have a bigger store. It can get crowded.  In conclusion, I definitely recommend you try this place out if you haven't yet. Their teaware make great gifts and their drinks are perfect for hydrating and cooling yourself on a hot day.", "Date": "2016-06-08", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Randi", "ReviewID": "M6_X4QqhP7QHRsvPk1Z96Q", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Jordan was wonderful and super helpful.

The manager in the santa hat was funny but also annoying when he was trying to sell us everything in the darn store. I was ecstatic to find out I could use my Starbucks card there which for some reason I had no idea that Starbucks owns Teavana.   Later in the week my perfect tea maker stopped working so i brought it in and the nice kid working the register recycled my old one and gave me a new working one which i really appreciated!

Chet was super nice and helpful with getting me started on their starter kit. After allowing us to smell a whole bunch of teas, we picked jade citrus mint and chamomile.  My daughter and I went in a couple weeks later to get her some youth Berry since she liked it so much.  Tonight we went back to pick up more mint, and as soon as we walked in Chet recognized me from my first visit. When we mentioned we were back for more mint he remembered that we had gotten the jade citrus before and asked if we wanted that again. I'm on a couple medications that make me really nauseous, so I asked if that was best for nausea. He said they have a new comfort blend I should try. I smelled it, and then said no way. He showed me the lemon, and that also wasn't good, too citrusy I think. So he offered to make me a cup of monkey oolong to see how that sits, on the house. I didn't like the after taste, so he made me a cup of the comfort blend, and just like it smelled, it wasn't good on my stomach. I couldn't even swallow it because it made my stomach turn. I honestly believe it's the citrus, it doesn't sit well on my stomach. He then made me a cup of jade citrus mint, again, on the house, because it's what works. We ended up buying a to go cup, in addition to 6 oz of tea, way more than what we originally went in for, simply because Chet is so awesome and helpful, and we don't mind spending extra money for amazing service.  Seriously the best beverage place I've ever been to. Chet treats you like family, and just is really incredible.

I headed into Teavana not knowing what to expect, and was a bit blown away by their samples, flavors, and products: so much variety!  Service is friendly, staff is available to discuss different tea types and steeping times and debate the merits of bagged versus loose-leaf, but much of this was over my head. I received several samples, and the gingerbread citrus and Oprah's Chai both stood out to me- super flavorful, not too sweet. Some other varieties were overly perfumed or infused and had just too much going on for my simple tea tastes.
