Granted we ate here really late on a Saturday night (err morning), but it does say 24hours. Anyway, the wife and I  selected the all you can eat BBQ for 29 bucks. The lady serving us was pretty rude but the food came out timely and we began cooking it at our table. I've been to many Korean BBQ establishments (to include time spent in Korea) and the food here was average at best. My wife really enjoys the side dishes more than the BBQ and asked for more of the cucumber kimchi and more of the goju squid side dish. The server was rude and stated that she could not have more than three servings. What part of all you can eat doesn't apply to side dishes? We also asked for some Soju and she acted like it was a chore to retrieve it as well. We also Never had our water glasses refilled. In fact, she was basically rude the entire meal. The shocker was when we paid and the bill was $100. I paid and left unhappy with the whole experience. Apparently a 16 ounce bottle of soju is 20-30 bucks, smh. I have no problem dropping a couple bills on a meal if the experience and food is deserving (the night before we ate at Craft Steak and dropped a few bills).

You need at least a party of two, you have a one hour to eat, their the galbi is limited to two pieces per person, and you have to pay for extra uneaten food.  First time we went, we didn't try the BBQ. The 6 side dishes were so tasty. Picked radish, picked zucchini, beansprout, kimchi, marinated beef, and seaweed. We tried the bibimbap and mandu guk. The bibimbap was very delicious (the rice was toasted perfectly!) with the exception of the eggplant that was a bit hard and plain. The mandu guk's broth was flavorful, the glass noodles' texture was on the spot, but the dumplings were more on the plain side (very lightly seasoned).   Second time I went alone and wanted to try the BBQ buffet but the lady said it was only available to two persons and more. I was disappointed and left. I'll try it next time for sure when I come back to Vegas.  For an Asian restaurant on the Strip, this exceeded my expectations.

The beauty of this place is that it is right on the strip and it is open 24 hours. Yes, you can get your samgyeopsal grilling on at 5am if you really wanted to. It hurts to buy alcohol here. Over $10 for an otherwise $3 bottle of soju. It hurts because on sale at the k-market, you can get 6 for $12... But then again, you are at a restaurant, so you get what you want, for a price.   We had decent service, the ahjummas tolerated us being crazy and would grill our meats like we were rookies.

This is directly across the Strip from the Monte Carlo.  This short stroll under several palm trees likely reduces their business level a lot - but it's readily accessible.  There's also some parking right beside the place, no signs of fees for this but might be $5 during the day.  They serve a full menu of Korean dishes including dinners, hot pots and barbeque.  But their prices run quite high for these individual items - for example, the Galbi included with All-You-Can-Eat is $35.95 and Bulgogi is $27.95 - while the AYCE is $29 and includes unlimited of 5 of these pricey items along with full side dishes and a serving of the Galbi.  What a deal!  The price has increased recently to $29 but this is still quite reasonable, for the quality of the food, the quantity and the location.  Sheesh, across the street they're seving fish and chips for $23!  And Ginseng is serving gourmet-quality food.  I visited about 10pm on a Thursday and I became the only customer not long after arriving.  I was greeted and seated warmly and looked at the regular menu before requesting the buffet.  I chose only 4 of the five meat entrees knowing I'd be lucky to finish that.  As it was, I ate very little of the sides and most of the main courses - but my appetite is limited these days.  I chose to skip the Chadolbaegi (brisket) due to reviews here and the Dakgui because it's chicken.  Meat dishes include your choice of up to 6 different items - 4 beef, 1 pork and 1 chicken: 1.  La Galbi - Beef short rib w. our house special sauce 2.  Bulgogi - Thin slices of rib eye marinated w. specially formulated soy sauce 3.  Chadolbaegi - Thin slices of beef brisket point without marinade 4.  Dakgui - Chicken meat marinated w. specially formulated soy sauce 5.  Sam Gyeop Sai - Thin slices of bershire pork skinless belly without marinde (thick-sliced bacon) 6.  Mae Un Dwae Jigui - Grilled spicy pork  Side dishes (8) included white rice, large romaine salad w/tangy dressing, Kimchi, soybean sprouts, pickled radishes and broccoli, grilled cucumber chunks and another green pickled dish.  All were worth a taste but I enjoyed the salad a lot, the sprouts and pickled items the best.  (The menu doesn't list these items or mention they're included.)  There's also a soy-based dipping sauce and a possibly ginger-based chunky dipping sauce.    The waitress understood that I wished assistance in cooking and provided that, after firing up the grill in the center of the table and bringing out my sides and water.  She started the Sam Gyeop Sai - basically thick bacon - laying out the full strips then using scissors to cut the strips into pieces.  After that gained a decent char on both sides, she started the Galbi and Bulgogi, leaving the Mae Un Dwae Jigui until last.  So I had bacon, thin-sliced steak, short ribs, then spicy pork.  My favorite was the Bulgogi, which has a fantastic marinade, followed by the Dwae Jigui, which also has a nice sauce.  The short ribs are more like something you'd find at a chinese buffet and the bacon was just bacon!  All good however.  I think I could manage the cooking myself next time - the bacon and pork favor a nice char and the others just need to be turned frequently to fully-cook.  And there will be another time.  Ginseng has just become MY place on the LV Strip - I'll never visit without eating there at least once.  I mean really, a sirloin steak for $50 or this for under $30 - there's no contest.

I don't walk into too many KBBQ places that have hostesses who cook and serve you the food. Our hostess checked in on us periodically to cook the meats and make sure we were satisfied with everything else on the table. It also helps to have a ringer button on the wall so you can ring them for things like water refills or meat orders when they're busier and less attentive.   FOOD: The meats are not exceptionally marinated or seasoned but the spicy pork and kalbi (short ribs) are still very good. The unseasoned thin slices of steak can be a tad dry so dip it in the bean sauce or sesame oil. I think my least favorite meat from the All You Can Eat menu is the pork belly. It's almost completely just fat. I did enjoy, however, the unlimited salad that comes with the meal. It's chopped lettuce dressed in a spicy vinegar and oil. Light, refreshing and a perfect compliment to the barbequed meats. It's important to note that their prices have risen within the past year or so. The AYCE option used to be around $22-24/person I think. Now it's $30, so eat your fill.   (this is why I'm giving it 3 stars, though it can arguably be 4 stars when taking everything into consideration)  ATMOSPHERE: The place has off-white tiled floors, oil stains on some of the glass round the place, and no music or anything. It's not much to look at but for a KBBQ place that opens 24hrs, I don't think 'atmosphere' should be something to concern yourself with.

Heaven is real and this is where it's at.  I'm from California but I can't even lie, the meat here is so much better than anywhere in LA's K-Town or all the places on Colima in Rowland Heights.   The service is a lot better here too. Back home all the ahjummas ignore you even if you're Korean, but the employees here were really attentive, particularly Esther. Not sure if she's the only Esther there since every other Korean female has that name, but you'll know who I mean if you get her as your server! She's extremely nice and she even flips the meat for you! This is like full service kbbq (unless it's like this outside California? lol)  Onto the meat- the kalbi is limited to 2 pieces per person (and you can only get it one time, so 3 people would only get 6 pieces total during their entire stay), but I don't mind because I can't find kalbi and all the other meat of this quality for $30 back home. The other meats from the AYCE menu were equally delicious and didn't really need to be seasoned or dipped in anything because they already had so much flavor. My sauces were basically untouched, which never happens for me.  I saw their sign near Fatburger but it took me a while to find it, then I found out it was behind Walgreens /o\  It's really hidden so I feel like a lot of people would miss out on this (along w/ the fact that people don't usually come to Vegas for kbbq).  All in all, great food and great service. There's no competition unlike the kbbq places back in LA/RH but they still give their all here, which I really appreciate.

When i got here, it wasn't too busy. it was maybe 930 at night. i was excited to try this place out and was starving since i knew i was going to a ayce I'm not going to eat alot during the day. i went in and had requested the ayce menu since that wasn't handed to me. they gave me the regular side order menu with most dishes average 15 to 20 bucks for one entree. i knew i would add a few more bucks for a better deal.   the inside is pretty much section off into your own table with a seating of four for most kbbq tables. they are roomy and do have lots of space for groups or small parties as well. the parking is in the back of the building. it was next to a club called krave, not sure if the club still exists. but this place is hidden and isn't easily spotted on the strip. they do have a sign with red letter outside the plaza. finding this place might be a bit tricky. the nearest casino would be mgm, if i remember correctly.   next i sat down and waited patiently for the food to arrive, and the servers were on break eating their dinners. i saw them eating their k bbq food and grilling it up. they had brought the raw meat and placed it all on the bbq and cooked it for me. i didn't do much because each time i try to flip it they come over and take the tongs and flip it for me. i wish i can go on my own pace then them serving it all the time. i felt like i was in a rush to stuff everything in my face at once. i can remember the meat was awesome and it was good. the texture and flavor was on point. i did ask for seconds of the side dishes which was the bean sprouts and pickled spicy cucumbers and kimchi as well. i know it was some good stuff. when i asked for more they don't acknowledge you but they do bring it to you. it felt like they didn't like it much or maybe just tired. the customer service is so so and kind of rude if i have to say so.   i did have a good experience and i did eat a few rounds before i called quit. it was nice they do honor one person customers for the k bbq. unlike some places in LA, where they don't honor one person ayce bbq. it did satisfy my craving for kbbq in vegas. i did end up finding a much friendlier environment for kbbq with much more food in vegas later on. if you ask me if i would do a repeat of this place, i rather travel a bit further out the strip to get some better and more food for the ayce.

They give you pretty big portions; I wasn't able to finish my Haemul Soondubu (Seafood Tofu Soup). I've had better Tofu Soup elsewhere however. Still, I was satisfied and left very full.   The prices seem to be higher than what I usually pay for Korean food in SoCal but then again, we're in Vegas.   It's a good option if you are craving Korean food and don't want to drive too far off the strip. If I could, I'd give this place 3.5 stars.", "Date": "2013-06-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Matt", "ReviewID": "MzIZSzxmihEwXo6vhXf-nw", "Overall": "3", "Content": "AYCE KBBQ open 24hrs!!!!  Unlike many of the strip restaurants which are jam packed during dinner hours, Ginseng was almost empty.  It was prefect for my hungry group, no reservations, and we were seated promptly after arrival.    The all you can eat menu is very limited to just 6 items.  For what it lacks in options, it picks up in quality, for parts of the menu that is.    - Bulgogi - The best meat in my opinion.  Loaded with green and white onions, it made for the best tasting meat option.   - Brisket - pretty average, not much to say anything about.   - Spicy pork - again, average option, not much going with the meat or marinate.   - LA Galbi - the bone-in short ribs were pretty legit, close second to the bulgogi.   - Pork belly - overly fatty.  More fat than meat, on the disappointing end.   - Marinated Chicken - I usually steer clear of chicken at KBBQ because of the longer cooking time.  The chicken and marinate we're definitely above my expectations.   I'm pretty spoiled by the dime a dozen KBBQ spot's in LA with great quality, so my review might be a bit biased.  Overall, the food is decent, if you're looking to fill yourself to the brim full meat, I'd say this is the place for you.

After choosing your meats (we went with beef and chicken), they fire up the grill on your table and you cook at your own pace. They slice the meat thin enough so you're not waiting very long for it to cook, which I think is a huge plus.

My fiancé and I were meeting my family here. They sat us right away even though we were still waiting for a few more people in our party. It was a Sunday evening about 9pm wasn't too busy. We all got the AYCE KBBQ. Our server was nice and even helped us cook some of the meat on the grill. Only thing was she would come and start flipping the meat over on our grill with her arm all in my way as I was trying to eat...Mind you she never even said excuse me. Food was ok nothing amazing I've had better. They never even asked to refill any of our stuff we had to ask for more salad, more meat, water and ask to change our grill out. Anyways, So when it came time to pay the hostess handed us our check stating that the gratuity was already added on our bill. Please keep in mind we only had a party of 5 total. The gratuity the added was about 15%. I asked the hostess why was there a Required gratuity when we didn't even have a party of 6 or more. Then she said it's actually 5 or more in Vegas. I go to Vegas a lot and I've NEVER heard of this before. Then she even said that some places it's 4 or more where it's mandatory gratuity. They don't even have a sign or anything stating this  gratuity requirement  anywhere on the menus or restaurant. We always tip but not 15% when the service was not all that great!   This has nothing to do with our service but we even seen one of the servers sneeze in her hand and wiped it on her apron and kept working and even grabbed a fork.

I come from southern California so I'm used to way way way better ayce kbbq places but even with extremely lowered standards this place is so bad.   There's only 6 options to choose from for 30$ a person; the proteins were not marinated very well and didn't taste good at all. Servers were all over the place and when you start out your order, instead of asking what meats you want they just bring out all 6 choices... I didn't even want pork or chicken but the brought it all out anyways... so make sure you tell them you don't want it so they can take it back instead because if they put it on the grill you have to eat it or else you'll get charged for not finishing your meat.   Also the biggest odd thing is they automatically charge tip to the bill, there was only 2 of us dining...is that even legal?? Tip is optional, and the amount we choose to tip shouldn't be fixed especially when their service is shit.  Do yourself a favor and don't come eat here, don't make the same mistake I did.
