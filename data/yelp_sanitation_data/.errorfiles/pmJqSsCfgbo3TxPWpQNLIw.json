The Caesar salad was plain and disappointing and the fruit on top of the chocolate pot was bitter and not in a good way.  The chef and the employees were very nice and really wanted our experience to be good, which I appreciated. I thought the tables and chairs were cafeteria-like and the dirty, old carpet we sat next to was unappetizing. Then the waitress introduces herself to us by shaking my hand, which made me want to wash my hands again. I got some star of anise from the store section and got charged for black garlic, I realized their mistake halfway home, and had to maneuver around a bunch of construction to make my way back. They gave me the cash difference on my purchase, but neglected to include the tax. Little details count. I'll go back again, and bring friends, because 99% of the food is great, I just hope they iron out the little details soon.", "Date": "2015-11-13", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "John", "ReviewID": "K-jYO76gYrS9IQTHPFjDNQ", "Overall": "3", "Content": "had the duck fat fries and the foie gras pancakes. wasn't blown away like I expected as read in the previous reviews. really wanted to try the carpaccio but they were out.

Tucked behind a bunch of other buildings. If I didn't actively seek this place, I would never have stumbled across it. This business is primarily a catering business and the market and cafe are a second thought.   Most of the food is on the smaller end of portion size. The quality of the food was top notch. It was very artfully presented and the flavor combination are well thought out. The dishes feature a lot of the goods that they sell in the market.   I had the radish salad, corn and crab soup, the pancakes and foie gras and a side of truffle fries. The salad flavor was well balanced...a little sweet, salty from the pancetta and sour and the roots were perfectly roasted.  The corn and crab soup had to grow on me...I hadn't notice that there was lime in the soup on the menu so I was a bit surprised when the soup had a sour note to it, but as I ate it, I just couldn't stop.   The the pancakes were a little more on the sweet side rather than the savory side with all the honey and grapes, but delicious all the same.  The fries were perfectly cooked....crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.

In every way possible. It is a candy store for food enthusiasts and chefs. If you're looking for a specialty item or ingredient, it's likely here and if it isn't, you just need to ask!  It's a fun place to just check out as well. You can learn about these unique foods from the extremely knowledgable Brett Ottolenghi. He is passionate about the products he carries and the people who make them. I love how everything is so carefully curated.  The best part of this already amazing place is their new cafe powered by Chef Johnny Church. It's lunch only and there are just six seats available. The menu is fun and exciting, which shouldn't be surprising with the access to great ingredients. There's a Prix Fixe option for $35 (basically a chef tasting menu) or you can order a la carte. We requested a couple items, but left the rest of the decisions up to Chef and we were very pleased with the selections!  Corn and Crab Chowder with Espelette Pepper oil and lime crema ($6). A nice warm broth with a light flavor from corn and a touch of crab meat. I loved the welcoming spice from the Espelette pepper.  Lion Fish Ceviche with Coconut and Citrus, served with Tempura Wasabi Leaves ($9). A really fabulous interpretation of ceviche with an unique use of coconut milk. This was my first time trying lion fish and it's great - a clean firm, white fish. Lion fish is dubbed  one of the most aggressively invasive species on the planet  and they threaten sea life on our Atlantic coast. Brett is an advocate for their consumption, but it hasn't caught on with chefs in town just yet. Either way, this is a wonderful way to try it! Also, it was my first time with wasabi leaves and those are fantastic as well.   Pancakes with Seared Sonoma Foie Gras and Three Grape Gastrique ($12). This is so, so amazing. Individual pancakes with delicious foie gras, a cool group of grapes (like Icicle Grapes) and Vermont maple syrup. This is a fantastic combination!  Crispy Brick Chicken Thigh made with Mary's Pasture-Raised Organic Chicken; served with mushroom bread pudding ($11). This delicious chicken thigh goes through quite the process. The thigh's bone is removed, then flayed before being stuffed with a truffle concoction. Then it's sous vide before getting crisped. The result is a succulent, flavorful chicken with crispy skin.   Duck Fat Fries with Sir Kensington's Ketchup. There's nothing to hate when it comes to cooking things in duck fat. I loved the topping of fried thyme and this natural ketchup is very tasty (of course, a product you can purchase here).  Zucchini and Squash  Spaghetti  with Tomato, Parmesan, Basil; plus, Housemade Burrata ($12). I make zucchini  pasta  at home, so I'm a fan of this preparation. I like that this dish was well seasoned and surprisingly flavorful. The creamy Burrata made it that much better.  Hexx Chocolate Pot de Crème with Fennel Pollen and Orange Segments ($4). This has a wonderful texture and richness that's thicker than pudding. I loved the semisweet nature of the chocolate and the orange paired really well.  They plan to change the menu frequently, so I'm happy to visit just as often. The price point is fantastic and I love the exposure to unique ingredients.

The selection is unique and it is the perfect place to go if you are sick of the chains (Applebee's, Outback, etc.). The menu is shown online. I had the mushroom Parpadelle pasta which was delicious. You could tell that the pasta was freshly made. If you are a picky eater, they have some tame options, like an awesome cheeseburger, but make sure to check the menu.

I came with my family for lunch and we were warmly welcomed and seated promptly.   Tables are limited and reserving one is definitely the way to go so be sure to do that.   We started with the highly talked about grilled cheese sandwich. It ain't your run-of-the mill American cheese variant, nope, not at all.  Montamore cheese provides a sweet start and a tangy (or maybe salty?) zip finish to your tastebuds as you take each bite.  Drizzled with locally produced honey, it's sweet warm gooey heaven in your mouth; the real grilled cheezus has been found!  I had the Piedmontese Truffle and Foie Burger.   Super lean beef but still flavorful, you can indulge without feeling an ounce of shame. A truffled egg and gouda cheese tops this medium rare beauty.  What wasn't present (or just not consistent) was the thick piece of foie gras seen in some Yelp photos.  (FOIE was the reason I came here!)  So either they skimped on my slice or cooked it to the point of it melting away (now foie butter?) but there was still slight disappointment.  Although still pretty good, I hope they get their dishes consistent.  Bring back the foie!  Now the Crispy Brick Chicken Thigh over Mushroom Bread Pudding that my wife ordered is to die for.   This was the sleeper that blindsided me by it's surprising burst of flavor.  The chicken is expertly cooked with black truffles accenting it and the mushroom bread pudding was fantastic.  I'll absolutely order this again.   We finished up with a dessert, Hexx Chocolate, Pot De Creme topped with slices of Mandarin Oranges.    Very rich and delicious, small but satisfying.    Be sure to explore the store aspect which connects to the cafe after eating.  There are plenty of organic and locally produced products in here for purchase.  Buy some foie, see the lionfish tanks, and above all, have a well-satisfying lunch when you visit here.

The Cafe hours are only Tuesday through Saturday from 11-2 and we had reservations for 1pm. I know for a fact that this is gonna be a popular spot just by seeing no empty tables as we arrived,  so we just checked out the store area while we waited for a table to open up.  Its a very spacious area sharing space with the market area, aquatic tanks, and the kitchen where diners may take a peek at the action where Chef Johnny Church and crew get down. Seeing fellow Yelpers check ins and food pix, I booked a reservation for  lunch and we were set to go. Here is a breakdown of our meal...  LIONFISH CEVICHE WITH TEMPURA SHISO LEAVES   I always look for items and  preparations  that I have never tried, so we originally planned to get the Jellyfish  Calamari with Squid Ink Aioli but they had a hard time getting the Jellyfish in, so we passed on that and  got the ceviche. Although it was beautifully presented  alongside the Tempura Shiso  (the menu says  Wasabi Leaves ) the Asian spices and influences used overpowered the lionfish, so it was difficult to find the flavor of Lionfish,  and if another type of fish was used, I still couldn't tell the difference. If you look at other ceviche pictures, the finished plates are inconsistent which could be a disappointment if and when you dine here and get something other than the delicious looking picture that persuaded you to check this place out? Know what I mean???The shiso leaves were tasty though.   PANCAKES WITH SEARED SONOMA FOIE GRAS AND THREE GRAPE GASTRIQUE   A take on breakfast with foie gras instead of butter and the gastrique instead of maple syrup had my palette lost in translation. Again, the presentation was nice, but the foie gras was not only thin and tiny, but borderline overcooked. The warm grapes didn't seem to do this plate any justice either. The components just didn't jive with each other. Not too fond of this one.  PIEDMONTESE FOIE AND TRUFFLE BURGER    Loved the flavors of this burger! Perfect temp (medium rare of course!) gooey egg, BUT AGAIN inconsistencies! Lookit, before I dined here, I saw Nik O.'s pic of the burger with a nice piece of seared foie on the burger...cool! I order the burger and see NO FOIE on my burger, but foie butter like it says on the menu...didn't think anything of it cause it doesn't say SEARED foie, but yesterday, I come across a good friends IG pic of the burger WITH a nice piece of seared foie??? So I get a skimpy , overcooked piece on the pancakes, and short changed on the burger?  Is there an additional charge or secret code I needed to know about? WHAT DA FOIEK!?!?!?! Duck fat fries were soggy and forgettable btw...  CRISPY BRICK CHICKEN WITH MUSHROOM BREAD PUDDING  This dish, I'd return for...Sous vide organic chicken thigh stuffed with black truffles, sealed with what's known as  meat glue  and crisped up on the stovetop and paired with a delicious savory mushroom bread pudding. Definite winner here.  All in all, an A-OK visit to the cafe, with a definite return to the store side for sure, but still on the fence for a return dining experience...Just be warned that you may not get exactly what you see in these pictures...

We bought a Groupon for a set menu and made reservation ahead of time, but when we showed up it looked like they did not have our reservation and were not prepared for our set menu. I am not sure if something was wrong with Groupon therefore they did not know we were coming or they were simply not prepared.  However, we were seated and quickly served. I ordered French pressed coffee, this is big enough for 2-3 people to drink and was only $5 I think.   The food was pretty good but I did not like that a few of our dishes were served together, family style instead of each of us having our own separate plate. We bought 3 Groupons for five course set. The first two courses: beef tartare and Caesar salad were served family style, not a big deal but I am used to getting separate plates when I do set menus. The beef tartare was ok but the Caesar salad was delicious, I am usually not a fan of Caesar but their dressing was homemade so it is very light, they put an egg on top which was such a nice touch.   After that we got the tomato soup which I did not like at all, but I don't any tomato soups to begin with so this is probably not their fault. Then came the pappardelle pasta with mushroom was so good, the sauce was just perfect but very oily, after finishing the plate there were plenty of oil left on our plate. Not a big deal to me but might bother some people.   Lastly is their foie gras pancakes... I think this is served as dessert. This was the BEST thing about the whole place. I am a fan of foie gras, I will eat it anywhere and anytime.. but foie gras and pancakes?? Sounds strange but it works!! The tiny pancakes, with the sweet grapes and the foie gras on top... the sweetness of the grapes and the saltiness of the foie gras just worked perfectly!! Wish the portion was bigger...   I am pretty sure that these dishes are on the regular menu too so you don't have to buy the set menu to try these items. They also have a little  market  in the restaurant where you can buy cheeses and cured meats, you can also buy oils and spices, although you can find the same oils and spices for cheaper at other places.", "Date": "2016-06-14", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Christine", "ReviewID": "T78bF0QE0EHRHQ8N0gLzsw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Such a cool place! I would have never found it if it weren't for a friend recommending it when I was asking for a place to buy caviar. I used to get caviar at Caviar Baron. But as that is not something I buy very often, regretfully it had been easily a couple of years and to my dismay had closed awhile back. But I was on the hunt as I had a fun girls weekend planned with my bestie and her mom. So when a friend recommended Artisinal Food and I found out quickly they are located around the corner from my work in the warehouse district by the airport, I could not wait to investigate! Upon walking in I was a bit puzzled as there were a few dining tables towards the front. Apparently they have all kinds of fun cooking and sampling demonstrations. I quickly signed up for the newsletter! I was a little overwhelmed at first as I'm hardly a connoisseur, but the nice gentleman working there was patient and extremely helpful. I picked out three types one being the coveted beluga which he informed me just recently became available again in this country. Each tin came with a complimentary mother of pearl spoon which is absolutely necessary for proper caviar serving. They also carry creme fraiche and blinis to round it out. While I was there I admired all of the gourmet products. Most of which I have only seen before on menus of expensive restaurants or on shows like Top Chef. I couldn't resist picking up a few things while I was there. Suddenly iberico ham, marcona almonds and fermented black garlic were added to my basket for no particular reason except I wanted it!

It was a Sat at 11:00.   Facility:  The restaurant is located kinda tucked off of the main commercial roads and tucked behind a few other businesses. When you walk in, there are only a few tables and chairs located in the middle of the  store , and the kitchen behind some glass windows.    Service:  The wait staff was very friendly. We met Brett, the owner, and he was very welcoming.  He also took the time to explain some of the very unique items on the shelf that they offer. I wish I had endless money and could afford some of those gourmet items.   Food:  Here's the food they served-  --Charred escarole salad with very yummy cheese grit croutons. The blue cheese was very mild, and for my non-blue cheese liking self, this was decent.  --Caesar's salad - I liked this...besides the savory poached egg, I liked the Dijon mustard flavor.  --Curry Squash soup  --Grilled cheese was gooey and delicious, although I would have preferred no honey on mine. One of my favs was the  homemade pickles which had a cumin flavor. --Carpaccio with octopus  --Lion fish ceviche with wasabi leaf fried croutons  --Brick chicken thigh with mushroom bread pudding - this was amazing!!

All the recommendations I had gotten were spot on.  This place is good!  I was fortunate to be able to order a prix fixe lunch with Chef Johnny Church deciding on the items I'd get.  They were:  Ibérico ham amuse-bouche with caviar Curry Kabocha squash soup Piedmontese beef and octopus carpaccio Lion fish ceviche Pancakes with seared Sonoma foie gras Hand cut pappardelle with Bolognese Crispy brick chicken thigh Hexx chocolate pot de crème  This lunch was dinner also because there was a lot of food and I didn't let anything go unfinished.  I was impressed with ingredients and preparations I don't normally see.  Tremendous creativity.  One of the last things I would have ordered would be the pancakes.  Yet, it was an excellent dish with a mix of three kinds of grape made into a gastrique and served with foie gras topping the small stack of mini pancakes.  Fantastic flavors and since I don't use maple syrup, a delight having a sweet that was so different with pancakes.  Chef Church asked me which pasta of two on the menu I wanted.  I looked at both and went with the Bolognese.  What he did was serve me the Bolognese with the hand cut pappardelle which was the other pasta.  The pork sausage, ground lamb, and chicken liver confit along with the tomato and mirepoix provided a great pasta.  The Bolognese was very rich.  I need mention the soup.  The curry squash soup had a very good flavor of curry and was a delightful soup on this cold day.  Finally, the crispy chicken thighs on mushroom bread pudding was outstanding.  Chicken thighs cooked and removed from the bone, then put back together with a layer of truffle and quickly fried crispy and served on the bead of mushroom bread pudding.  Outstanding!  Finishing off with a light dessert of Hexx chocolate pot de crème topped with orange slices and topped with fennel pollen.  Chocolate and orange is always a great combination and this was a winner, too!  I'll be returning and enjoying some of the other items on the menu.

Seriously suits my palate well. I've gone back 3 consecutive weeks and didnt get to go to one week and I am beyond hangry about it and rushed back to take my mom who was visiting. The menu is small and so we've sampled through it.   So this isn't quite your  standard  restaurant, it feels more like a pop up since Artisanal is a gourmet food ingredient store front now with tables in the middle and it is open only (currently) for lunch 11-2.   I really like the Piedmontese truffle and foie burger here. I am not someone who craves burgers, but this is what I want in my life. Its perfectly seasoned and rich - no need to doll with some condiments. I admittedly love sauce and I am content with this as is. Good quality meat so go on and order medium rare here. Do get the duck fat fries. I love thick cut fries that have crunch and pillowy goodness inside. They serve it with Sir Kensington ketchup, which is more homemade style and not Heinz like.   Brick Chicken Thigh is yummy and full of sliced truffles with comforting mushroom bread pudding. One of my favorites and I don't really order chicken dishes as it normally just doesn't hit the spot for me, I make better roast chicken than most.   Caesar made to order isn't that super creamy stuff that most people consider. I like this more vinegar and anchovy based thing. I get incredibly sad when caesars don't have anchovy. The soft egg in salad is different, but I can dig it.  Beef and octopus carpaccio is nice quality and lovely seasoning with the black garlic.   Foie pancakes with grape gastrique I didn't know if I would like as I don't like warm grapes (I dont even eat room temperature grapes), but I really enjoyed the flavors in this dish.   Lionfish ceviche has a aggressive seasoning on it of a fragrant coconut curry chili oil base, but I kinda like it. It would be nice to try a dish where the lionfish is in the forefront. They're   I really enjoy the simplicity of the montamore grilled cheese sandwich with honey. I think I need a brick of that cheese always.   Baia Bolognese is nicely rich. I think the straciatella cheese is delightful so it's worth the upcharge to have freshly made soft cheese.   Their homemade papardelle with mushrooms and artichoke is simple, but one of my favorites. So comforting and well executed to make the ingredients speak.   Curry Kabocha soup is something I am hit/miss on. Some places put too much curry but this is just enough.  Charcuterie plate is a decent portion and selection for $12. I've had far less for more in cost.   Charcuterie sandwich is pretty good. I like the addition of the egg in it so that it isn't your typical cold cut sandwich with some vinegar and oil.  Hexx Pot de creme is rich and smooth and just enough after a full meal.   The french toast reads more like a bread pudding to me, but it was nice with the fresh applies.   Do try their ice tea as it changes daily and have been all solid. We've had a pomegranate with fresh pomegranate in it, a fragrant jasmine style one, and a smooth black tea with lemon in it. Coffee is nice local stuff in a french press.   The service is always friendly from miss Carrie (sp?). She's super nice and makes sure to check on people often.   I cannot wait for the seasonal menu changes. I live across town in the NW, but we make the trip to the SE for this place. What's genius is that after eating a meal that makes me happy about food, I get inspired.

I told him to trust me and he's glad he did!! Cause it was the best brunch we have had! The cafe is half store area, half cafe so there is not a lot of seating. We were lucky to walk in and there was a table for two. The service was very personalized as I believe it was the owner who took our order. You can tell that every item on the menu is handpicked and he truly cares about the quality of the food. Even the coffee (which was delicious!) had a nice backstory to it.  I am not gonna review every single item we ordered because everything was great! From the salad, the grilled cheese, pancakes, and truffle burger.

It is a unique cafe, in the middle of a grocer of fine foods, at a location I would never have ventured, if not for the rave reviews and vivid food pix shared by yelpers.   Everything on the menu looked great, so instead of choosing, I was excited to try the 5 course tasting menu. I was going to write a long play-by-play of the experience, but I'll cut to the chase. Food quality and flavor was absolutely top notch, truly flavorful, and beautifully plated. Absolutely no complaints about the cooking or the food.   However, I was sorry to be disappointed in a few things.  First, while very polite, the service was weird, for lack of a better word that might come across too harsh. Timing of each course was off-putting. Courses were either 10 min wait in between or came at the same time. Also, was not offered anything but water to drink, and had to ask for refills. Chef came to the table few times, I think.  His comments of  my this... and my that  sounded like it came from a chef but he never introduced himself, just described the dish.   Second, the portions were quite small, unlike previous reviewers pix (like Norm K on 12/2/15).  Every course except the octopus carpaccio and the desert could be eaten in one bite. The brick chicken and mushroom bread pudding was absolutely fantastic, but only a small slice of chicken atop a spoon-size serving of pudding. I wasn't even particularly hungry to start with, but felt A little shorted. Judge for yourselves from my pix.   That said, i do believe this is a gem of a spot and I would like to try again. There's really nothing like this in Vegas, and I do wish these guys success because they do great food.", "Date": "2016-03-05", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Eric", "ReviewID": "2DHNmpCiauqgVZhSl5Lrlg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Worth seeking out for a gourmet lunch at almost fast food prices.

We had a 1pm reservation for a Saturday. We had about a 15 minute wait for the table to become ready as there was another large party at the table. That was ok as it gave us time to look around at everything they had to sell. Once we were finally seated & we received our drinks a complementary MontAmore Grilled Cheese, Brioche with local honey was delivered to the table cut in pieces for everyone to have a sample. It was good. We ordered many things off the menu (see photos) but I have to say my favorite was the Crispy Brick Chicken Thigh with Mushroom Bread Pudding which I had not ordered. I will defiantly have to come back to order that. I had ordered the Pancakes with Seared Sonoma Foie Gras. I have to say that it was good but I was not blown away. I certainly liked the pasta dishes that were ordered & the chicken better. I ordered for dessert the Croissant French Toast which I did absolutely love.

Owned and operated by Brett Ottolenghi, a man whose passion for providing the very best ingredients to local homes and kitchens is virtually unmatched, with the culinary talents of John Church on display for a few tables dispersed amidst the market, Artisanal Foods Cafe has slowly transitioned from a ticketed 'event' to one more amenable to walk-ins and although a set menu is indeed offered it was instead carte blanche that two-top dined, the kitchen and service staff having grown to accommodate several other patrons with Chef Church himself providing the soundtrack as well as lengthy descriptions of each plate.  Gifted a Peach Hard Cider from Brett's family Orchard plus complimentary bottled water repeatedly filled as the twelve-course meal took place, round one featured a half-dozen Oysters pulled from their native waters less than 36-hours earlier and although personally rare to order such things, while my table-mate was something of a local expert, the briny bivalves were actually amongst the best I've ever tasted, the liquor tempered by sweet n' spicy Mignonette while the muscle itself finished smooth and clean.  Using items from the store for obvious reasons, Smoked Sturgeon given a visual manifestation with several juveniles swimming in a nearby tank, course two saw John send out a Sunny-side composition of Quail's Eggs topped in Paddlefish Caviar plus shaved Red Onions, the flavors undoubtedly bold yet traditional with buttered toast points made for dipping or, perhaps better, as a delivery device.  Not one to take the easy route, a lengthy process elaborated upon when describing plate three, none but Vegetarians should leave Artisanal Foods Cafe without sampling the Octopus Sirloin Carpaccio, each 'surf & turf' slice so thin that it melts on the tongue while flavors come across with a robustness more than capable of standing up to toppings of Black Garlic and Caper Vinaigrette.  Coursing the menu with pacing and an evolution of flavors that evidenced Chef Church's roots in fine dining, the next two plates focused on the purity of their ingredients prepared simply, a fluffy omelet folded around truffled Gouda with curls of Spanish Iberico eating like a cloud of rich flavors while the subsequent salad featured bright Tomatoes and Melons from the 3rd Street Market with flecks of black Kala Namak salt complimenting warm Mozzarella made moments prior in the Cafe.  Using the salad as a springboard to heavier entrees the midpoint of the meal was marked by two free range Egg dishes of which Johnny seemed quite proud, and although the 4x4 was a delicious fork and knife upgrade on the classic Sausage, Egg and Cheese Sandwich the cleverly titled  Tre Swine Ye  was a veritable ode to Southern breakfasts as Chorizo and Smoked Ham enriched buttery Geechie Boy Grits anchored by Bacon-wrapped Porchetta.  Unable to resist adding his truffle-packed sous-vide Chicken Thigh to brunch, in this instance fried atop a toasted roll with housemade Spread and Pickles, a bridge to sweets was next brought forth in the form of pan-seared French Toast coated in crushed Snickerdoodle cookies, the sugar held in check by chevre while California Strawberries found an amicable partnership with Cherry compote from the Chef's home state.  Now selling Desyree Albergant's world-class Gelato at Artisanal Foods, a four-pack of flavors sent out to ready the palate for two more plates, one would be challenged to name a frozen confection better than Gelatology's Lemon Pound Cake or Chocolate Croissant, a silky duck liver quenelle far better than one experienced previously at a Michelin 3* establishment offering smooth transition to a  short stack  of pillowy pancakes topped with a steak of Foie Gras amidst varieties of Grapes and dessert Wine Glaze.  Incorporating several personal touches into his cooking it was to a family favorite that Johnny turned to end the afternoon, and although I grew up less than an hour from the Chef's hometown my childhood was never blessed by a dessert quite like the moist orange and white Marble Cake that reminisced of Push-Ups or Hostess' Orange Cupcakes with a far more natural flavor and icing as light as whipped cream.", "Date": "2016-03-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Luis", "ReviewID": "xO4dTUCiwr6u4pQPoqlnkQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "The best place in las vegas amazing food #the best service # good el mejor lugar para comer en las vegas productos de españa a muy buen precio bonito del norte y cosas esclusivas y la comida increible las patatas fritas en grasa de pato con ramas de romero wow de calidad superior lo recomiendo 100% servicio amigable y buen precio barato diria yo para la calidad de lo q ofertan", "Date": "2015-10-24", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Stefany", "ReviewID": "NUDt6I5V7bwbZPrQsThPoQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Incredible. Artisan Foods has outdone themselves! I dig the concept: selling specialty ingredients for home cooking, and showcasing store products at an on-site café! Menu is limited, but everything we tried was great. This is definitely a spot to make reservations, as seats are limited. Come hungry and bring a couple of friends- I wish I'd had an extra person or two with me to order the entire menu to share!  JELLYFISH  CALAMARI  FRIES WITH SQUID INK AIOLI: The best calamari ever! Breading was light, seemed to be cornmeal based, and did not adhere so well, but this was the best-tasting calamari or jellyfish dish I've had. Bright, acidic, fresh, with that great squid ink aioli. Wanted to lick the plate. A must-order, great start to our meal. LIONFISH CEVICHE: It was a bit sad to order and consume this dish while staring directly at a lionfish in the tank beside us. But lionfish are the cockroaches of the ocean and they need to be eaten! (True story, Google it.) The ceviche itself was very citrusy and the flavor of the lionfish was not the star of the dish, it seemed to be overpowered by the other ingredients. But the tempura shiso leaves were the best vessel for eating this! BF said he wouldn't get this again, but I am open to other versions of lionfish. MADE TO ORDER CAESAR: The Worcestershire flavor is more pronounced in this version than in others I've tried. Portion is easily shareable, the egg was perfectly poached. MONTEAMORE GRILLED CHEESE ON BAGUETTE WITH LOCAL HONEY: This dish is where my BF finally  got it  about why I was so anxious to come here ASAP. This is the best grilled cheese. It's not a traditional version, but it's crisp and buttery, with a bright, salty cheese balanced well by the use of local honey and plated with house-made pickles. Portion is small like the price tag ($6), great for sharing as a starter. CRISPY BRICK CHICKEN THIGH: WOW. The chicken thigh itself is so tender, and served atop a wonderful savory mushroom bread pudding. I cook with chicken thigh a lot, and don't particularly care for the texture of bread pudding, so I almost didn't order this but it really was amazing. The chopped chives on top added just the right amount of verdant freshness. HANDCUT PAPPARDELLE PASTA: BF's entrée choice at our server's recommendation, reminiscent of a beef stroganoff, sans beef. The pasta was thin, delicate ribbons, married with a heap of roasted mushrooms and artichokes. Great dish. CROISSANT FRENCH TOAST: BF's dessert pick, lots of flavors and textures going on here. Bread wasn't too thick, caramel apple cider sauce wasn't too sweet, and the fresh julienned green apples on top were a great accent.  HEXX CHOCOLATE POT DE CREME: Simple but very good. Three slices of orange over a pot of rich chocolate mousse, with fennel pollen. I can't honestly tell you what the pollen tastes like but everything came together well- and this coming from someone who usually shies away from dishes that combine chocolate and citrus.   The new industrial location is near their former dwelling, but with increased floor space and a kitchen. Adding the café concept is wonderful, and Vegas needs more spots like this that highlight local talent (both cooking and sourcing!) in a way that locals can appreciate. This is making the shortlist of places we will be bringing visiting friends and relatives.

On our first visit, we started with the charcuterie tray; at $12, it's underpriced. $20+ would be reasonable for this dish. The cheeses were wonderful, and there were some nice little surprises - I don't want to spoil it for you.  Actually, I don't want to ruin any of it for you - my description would not adequately describe how good everything was. We tried nearly every dish, finishing off with some fantastic desserts. The Pots au Creme is to die for, and the French Toast defies description. My son is a chef, and this was his favorite, both in appearance and taste.  On our second visit, we had the prix fixe menu. There was some confusion over reservations, so the chef was still at a catering event. We seemed to be unexpected, and were rushed to make room for the next group - also us. It was awkward.

Like the grocery store portion, the cafe offers a heavily curated food menu, focusing on foods they carry in the store. For example, one of the things we tried today was an elegant grilled-cheese on brioche, which was accented with one of the honeys they carry. (Honey and grilled cheese are delicious, I learned.) The pots de creme for dessert featured the Askinosie Chocolate they sell. The lionfish was the most-stunning dish we tried, although a little unfair to compare to delicious Mary's pasture-raised organic chicken. Apparently they sell fresh lionfish, or will soon. It was so hard to choose from menu we had six different dishes plus dessert - for lunch for two. (Portions are small, however.)  The cafe is helmed by Brett Ottolenghi, along with chef Johnny Church, both of whom stopped by our table to greet us and ask what we thought. I like that. They also are running a catering business - the cafe is the  downtime  from catering.   This is not the place to bring your aunt who thinks dinner at Chili's is a real treat.
