Not all the candy is available but if you look hard enough, you might find something (although, you might not make a large purchase). It is by the pound here, as with all the candy shops. There are giant candy selections which is always fun to see, like giant reese's peanut butter cups. There are the novelty type candy, like chocolate covered insects, etc. And, also, clothing and other branded merchandise, as well.    We did find something here for the whole family. This would be a  if you're in the area  type stop, not special trip, unless you live or work near here.", "Date": "2016-04-21", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Dani", "ReviewID": "10wgL4g9F1BjwH4Mxuo8Fw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "OH MY GOSH! This is such a fun store. They have a lot of fun candy-themed items (like the pound box of Sour Patch Kids) and tons of bulk bins. If you grab a box (looks like Chinese Food Containers) you can fill up as much as it will hold, as long as it will close, for $14.00. Be careful though - they have the Jelly Belly Section, and when you pull those levers, it does not take a lot to quickly make a bag heavy. The associate when I was in the store was very helpful, as without realizing just how much I pulled from the Jelly Beans, I was in a plastic bag, mixed, for over a pound, which would have cost $23. He directed me to the boxes, and there was still some room to add a few Swedish Fish to the top. A fun store, great novelty items, many specialty items (who would not like a POUND Bar of Kit Kat?) and just a great store to pop into!", "Date": "2015-06-08", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Debra", "ReviewID": "4IVB1gyr2Fk6Ss6f0Xjfqg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "This store is so fun!!

It's your typical kitschy, novelty candy store with a mix of retro sweets, gummi selections, chocolates, a splash of cool, funky, and hilarious stuff, kinda like a combination of bits from  Sugar Factory, Grandma Daisy's, and Rocket Fizz.  Toys, gadgets, and stuffed animals are among other options you may purchase other than sugary sweet treats here, and if you need more than your standard sized candy bar, those Mega Bars are available too, and are great for sharing....or not.  Great spot to grab some candy for the movies(Regal Cinemas is in the vicinity) but parents, beware of the adult themed selections that are also available. You may have to suffer the embarrassment of your kid running up to you wanting a Colon Blow or even a Di@k In A Box! Yes, they have them here. You have been warned! ALOHA!!!

I feel like a kid again!!! So many fun candy products. Ones I haven't seen since my childhood. The staff are so friendly and helpful. They have candy for every age and taste. Love that they have Japanese candy too. Will definitely visit when I go to Vegas again.

Not candles though, however would make a nice candle scent.  I understand it's Vegas.  I should expect some oopsies and realize hear, see, say no evil does not apply here.  Buuuut this is a candy store.  The scene definitely inviting for smaller children.  Attractive colors and displays to cause unconscious luring - even me - into this candy store.    I want chocolate... I'm looking around and reading randomly at the same time.  And just as I get closer, what in the world am I witnessing???!!!  Turn around and these innuendos just seem to be tucked somewhere least expected.    And then, I forgot I wanted chocolate.  Also, why is the creepy cotton candy haired mannequin even watching us?   :-l", "Date": "2016-06-01", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Amyra", "ReviewID": "Hoig0YXa5yZqj4gGoMt1-Q", "Overall": "5", "Content": "It's a bit pricey but every confectionary place usually is. It's clean and everything is very bright and fits well with the candy theme. They also have unique candies, giant sized candies, and bins filled with an assortment of candies you can choose and when finished pay by how much it weighs.

I'm weird I know but I'd rather waste my calories on important things like chips or booze.   We walk by It's Sugar which I've never been in. When my 4 year old looked at me with her big eyes and asks  Mommy can I please get some candy? , I resist the urge to roll my eyes and say ok.  This store is like Willie Wonka and Spencer's gifts had a baby! I was finding myself in awe of the craziest gifts I never knew existed but had to buy. We could have spent hours laughing at everything in there.   We bought our items, the girls working there were very nice. I got gag gifts and the kiddo got her little bag of sour gummy worms and we walked out with big grins on our faces like we hit the happiness jackpot.  It took a four year old to remind me to be  like a kid in a candy store  meant to surrender to my inner giggles and enjoy.  If you're looking for a random gift shop, this could be your jackpot place. I will definitely be coming here again - especially at Christmas!", "Date": "2016-05-27", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jenn", "ReviewID": "K0acU57df2z8yJdFpaSoyw", "Overall": "1", "Content": "I work in the mall and have shopped at Its Sugar a lot in the past three years. The candy quality has dropped over the past few months now and it's pretty disappointed. To hard, stale, chocolate with white on it from age.  Today I decided to give it a shot. The store was a mess. The white counters dirty in between the canisters.  My favorite licorice ROCK Hard, like break your teeth HARD! Canisters half empty. So, I buy a few wrapped caramels and chocolate covered gummies. Should not be more than 4 bucks! Comes to over 7. What?! The scales have to be rigged. Nonsense! I will never shop again. Very very disappointing.  Clean the store, fill the canisters and throw away old candy.", "Date": "2016-10-08", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
