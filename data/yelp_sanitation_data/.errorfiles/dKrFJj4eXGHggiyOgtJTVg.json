I was floored at how big and clean it was. One year on, this place is still my go-to Asian market but I have to say it's gotten a lot less clean. My husband won't come in as he thinks it smells suspect. So he makes me do his bidding.   The produce section here is incredible. Lots of everyday vegetables/fruit as well as Asian goodies. If you need 6 different types of Vietnamese mint....this place has it. Every green leafy vegetable is available here. They have lotus root (packaged and cleaned as well as right from the ground), Asian eggplant, lemongrass, shredded green papaya, galangal, pomelos, longans, mangosteens and various varieties of Asian pears. I'm here once every couple of weeks stocking up.   The place stocks all sorts of dry/fresh noodles, Flat, stringy, bean thread, udon...you name it, you get it. Of course, they have a plethora of Asian spices and sauces (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Indonesian, Thai...I know I'm leaving lots of geographies out). I love that they have an amazing selection of soy products (tofu, beancurd sheets, tofu noodles etc.).   Basically, any thing you need to cook yourself up an Asian feast...SF will be there to help you. It also stocks up on cookware and serving utensils (rice cookers, woks, chopsticks, Asian bowls).   Best of all, the prices here are extremely reasonable. Cilantro (2 bunches for 98 cents), Spring Onion (4 bunches of 98 cents)...you get the idea.   I am thankful to have this SF in town just because it affords me the opportunity to cook Chinese/Southeast Asian food without hunting miles for ingredients.  However, I do have a gripe about this SF...the parking lot. There is plenty of parking but apparently people think shopping carts belong in between cars, in parking spots or next to the curbs (not on the curb, but lying next to it). I would be super careful parking here and probably wouldn't dare to leave my car in this lot on a windy day. People: It's not that hard to walk a few steps to deposit your cart where it needs to be!!!", "Date": "2010-12-10", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "G", "ReviewID": "9ZxBP6F6kbqZ2KeaM4Xeqg", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Omg they are SO rude there.

We don't always have to go out, so I suggested we just stay in, I'll cook dinner, and we'll see a flick via Red Box(We watched Maleficent) or Netflix. Wifey was all for it!  Seafood was her suggestion, so I suggested Mussels and Shrimp because these were quick, easy, and cook in no time. I can't believe the cheap prices we have here for seafood(and we're in the desert!?!?) Mussels were only $2.99/pound(had to get two pounds), and huge head-on Shrimp was $7.99. One pound was plentiful for two people.  Got a baguette for a buck at nearby Dakao, and I was set....Our entrees for the evening were Shrimp with Chili-Garlic Butter and Steamed Mussels with White Wine, Butter, Shallots, Garlic, and Parsley which was done in 20 minutes and I think it took longer for the crostini to toast up in the oven! Great selections and prices here ($20 for a feast for two!) for what you would pay double or maybe even triple for  at any seafood restaurant! Heads up....
