The wife had an arugula salad.  She said it was one of the best salads she has ever had.  We both had steak that was cooked perfectly and was wonderful.  On top of this the staff that served us was the nicest, most helpful staff I have ever came across in my entire life, and that is no exaggeration.  Our server Todd was extremely knowledgeable, kind, helpful, and a great conversation.  Hes the main reason I felt it necessary to write this review.

Our Open Table reservation mentioned our celebration, and they shined at making me feel special with that thoughtful gesture.  Our waiter was very informed and enthusiastic about the wine selection. We shared a bottle of a special house wine that was very tasty and went well with our meal.  My Love and I shared the spinach salad with goat cheese, pancetta, warm bacon-balsamic vinaigrette with bacon on top. It was really good, and a very interesting flavor. Our friends shared the Caesar salad with romaine leaves, white anchovy, and black pepper croutons, and both agreed it was the best Caesar salad they've ever had.  The four of us did the best style of eating, what I call tag-team eating, where we order two different items and share, so we can try more dishes. Our party ordered two of each of the: -17 oz. Bone-In Rib Eye -Chilean Sea Bass  The rib-eye was absolutely delicious. It wasn't just large. It was large, tender, well-seasoned, and well-grilled.  The sea bass just melted like butter in your mouth. It was so good!  The sides were good, too. The roasted seasonal vegetables were fresh and seasoned with rosemary. The garlic mashed potatoes were smooth and satisfying.  My friends shared a dessert, the bittersweet chocolate lava cake with pistachio ice cream and mint sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Fy4t2XHIRKwMk_ocCZze0Q?select=bzRDV05eD7MojFn3rnRsWQ). They loved it.  Service was sporadic, but it seemed intended so that we could enjoy our experience, not just dine and dash.  Overall, we had a great dinner experience, and I'd love to come back another time.

Entrees are served with family-style portions of delightfully garlicy mashed potatoes and nicely flavorful roasted vegetables. The meal also came with a tray of specialty salts to try on our bread and our entrees - a really nice touch that brings the meal up a notch. When you order a steak, you're given a choice of one of their signature sauces. They range from traditional to more interesting options.  The quality of our meal was excellent. The steaks were perfectly cooked, the sides were fantastic, and to top it all off, the waiter gave us each a complimentary glass of champagne to celebrate our occasion.

The result? ENVY Steakhouse.  Star 1: How was the service and atmosphere?  While by Vegas standards this may be standard (comparable to some of the restaurants in the popular hotels), ENVY is without a doubt very, very nice. The atmosphere is elegant, and our server was absolutely brilliant. Not only did he know everything about the menu, but he was brilliantly helpful pointing us in the direction of the evening's festivities. To top it all off, our orders were all perfect (party of six) and service was prompt. Star Granted.  Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  This is always tricky with nicer restaurants since you're obviously paying for the experience, but even taking that into consideration, I can't quite justify the $36 that I paid for ENVY's Shellfish Stew:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=vIZ9bM2Z2MSTY0U4ZGDbNQ&userid=OKX-V5j_qfuOebeHeWGrHg  When it comes down to it, I'm looking at about six shrimp, half of a potato, five clams and at most two crab legs. $36? Sorry. No Star Granted.  Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  While lacking in the portion department, the quality of ENVY's food really is quite good. My Shellfish Stew was tasty, and the filet mignon that one of my friends got was nothing short of one of the best cuts of meat I've ever had. Dual Stars Granted.  Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

The discount was a nice draw to get me here, but I was impressed and would go back.  BREADBASKET: Okay, bread is pretty basic but they also give you this killer kalamata olive tapenade. ESPRESSO RUBBED SKIRT STEAK: Espresso flavor was bold, this dish was better than expected. FRIED CALAMARI: Large portion, two dipping sauces, preferred the spicy ketchup. BF really enjoyed this app. CAESAR SALAD: served with large anchovies, and dressed just right. Better than the usual version you find at steak places. SIGNATURE SEA BASS: I'm more of a trout kind of girl, but the promise of a truffle crust lured me in. The fish was well executed, moist, and flaky, and the portion was generous. BF also enjoyed this. FLANK STEAK: Menu lists this as a 12 ounce portion, but what we received was huge. Even with both of us eating at it, we had nearly a third to take home. Cut was recommended by our waiter. LOBSTER MAC AND CHEESE: Not too cheesy, not to heavy on the seafood sweetness, good complement to the other dishes without being ridiculously rich.  Entrée meats are served with a trio of salts to season yourself. That and the live jazz drifting from the lobby were nice little extra touches that added to the experience. Black and red décor scheme with luxe accents made this place feel like more of a splurge than it really was.  Unfortunately I cannot remember our servers name, but he was pretty great.

Yah that last part, I'm sure, was enough to get you alcoholics on board.   There understandably wasn't as big a spread as those at the hotel buffets on the strip, but the food that they did have was pretty decent quality. Pretty damn decent I'd say.  The traditional breakfast foods. The eggs were very well done however the sausage was a bit tasteless.  The omlettes they were making to order seemed to be a big hit (decent wait for them).   The seafood was probably the worst part of the buffet. That's not to say it was bad. It just wasn't too great. They had oysters (great), crab legs (mediocre at best), and shrimp (slightly above-average).   The desserts I didn't have but my friend ate every single dessert she got - she made me take a picture of how clean her dessert plate was.   The best part of everything was the unlimited alcohol in the form of wine and champagne/mimosas.    The whole meal was accompanied by an old dude playing old American beats on a grand piano with something like 30 60+ year-olds clapping along and continuously toasting.

I say this with having been to many excellent steakhouses around the country, but locally steakhouses that charge the same amount but are far better include: The Striphouse, Andiamo and Morton's to name a few.  I'm not trying to be hurtful in my review, but if you're going to charge these prices I expect a couple things great, flavorful food and outstanding customer service.  Neither of these were displayed.  If this had been one of my very first steakhouses I had ever been to I probably would have thought it to be ok, but when when you're in the vacation destination of the world...step it up or charge a reasonable amount for what you get.  You have competition and they are currently killing you.   My husband and I ordered the Tomahawk steak for 2 ($95) and we ordered it rare (we're from the midwest and like our beef with the most flavor) along with the asparagus and lobster mac n cheese.   What I didn't like: How little seasoning or flavor there was to the Tomahawk.  The tomahawk was served with asparagus (which is not noted on the menu) this would have been wonderful if the server knew what dishes came with what for the evening and then we would have tried another option. The bernaise sauce was fair, it almost tasted sour.  The service was average for an Applebee's.  We were there on a Wednesday night - it was not busy.  We waited, for everything...them to take our order, for drink refills, the check.  From the time we sat down until our food arrived at our table was 50 minutes - unacceptable. Things I liked: They didn't charge you $5 for sauces for your steak like some other places do.  All of their sides were only $8 I just feel like people should know that for the same amount of money they can have much tastier steaks and extremely better service at other steakhouses in the area for the same price or less.", "Date": "2014-12-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Derrick", "ReviewID": "IOiEtgiNobp6uQ9yL57zCQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Excellent!

I was looking for a nicer place to eat with my wife, going someplace I had not been to in Vegas; we went to ENVY based on the overall reviews and the current reviews it is off the strip next to LV convention center.  We had reservation at 7:30 pm on a Saturday night and it was not too busy which was nice for conversation. Our choices for dinner was based on our favorites and what has been reviewed.   We started with the Frtto Misto, and it was very overcooked and pretty hard, based on other plates that came out of the kitchen this was probably a mistake. I ordered the Sea Bass and my wife ordered the Filet. My wife likes it with some pink in the middle I had her order it medium (we can always send it back if need be) and it came out great and she really enjoyed it. I have had Sea Bass before and it is one of my favorite, ENVY's version has panko breadcrumbs which gives it a nice crunch but I would of been fine without it. But the bass was over cooked a bit, so the cutting through like butter affect you can get with Sea Bass was not there. It was edible, but disappointing, I did try the lobster mac and cheese, i have never had that before so I have no point of reference if it was good or bad. It was interesting but if that what it normally tastes like I would probably pass in general.  Another down side was service, it was ok but it was not busy. One of my pet peeves is waiting for a drink. I can completely understand in a packed restaurant, this happened a couple of times in a non-busy day, Our server was nice and personable, the food did come out hot.

We ordered: Lamb chop-M NY steak-MR 3 Rib eye steak-MR Filet mignon-MR Ahi tuna special Spinach, truffle fries, and mushrooms  It took over 45 minutes to get our food and we were the only ones in the restaurant. When our steaks were served it was either undercooked or overcooked. We were short on time so didn't want to make it a big deal but did let our server know. Only an apology but didn't offer to take it back?! Come on, each steak was $50+.  My ahi tuna special was nothing special at all! It was bland and didn't even taste fresh!  Spinach and mushrooms were fine. You really can't mess up on that, can you? The truffle fries was the best thing we had! SAD!   We appreciate the slices of lemon cake and cheesecake you sent to the birthday folks but that doesn't justify the poorly served foods.

Then our server, Krisztian, thanked me for being a return customer (guess he checked my open table account). It has been a while since the last time I was here so we relied heavily on Krisztian's knowledge and suggestions.    We decided on ENVY's signature Chilean sea bass and the bone in filet (ordered medium,  per Krisztian's recommendation). The sea bass came with two separate sides: a heaping side of mashed potatoes and brussels sprouts.  The sea bass was buttery and tender. The steak was cooked just right and was juicy. The portion was enough for two people. We were more than satisfied with the flavors of every dish and our stomachs were happily full.  We asked for our check but instead, we were surprised with a slice of moist red velvet cake, topped with berries,  as a thank you for being a return customer.

The truffle fries are easily large enough to share and worth every penny.  The Seared Ahi Tuna appetizer was better than expected for a steakhouse, and if anything missed, it was our dessert, the Asian Apple Pie, which was a bit awkward to eat and didn't wow me at all.

We had the signature 19 oz bone in ribeye done  medium-plus  between medium and medium well - because my boyfriend likes it rarer than I do.  It was definitely right on the money, but you could really taste the effect of the dry aging on the more rare parts, it was fantastic.   We also had the beef cheeks that had been slow cooked for several hours.  The beef cheeks were ridiculously tender, had a pretty thick balsamic vinegar sauce, and tasted better when in the same bite as the truffle mashed potatoes they were served with.

Our plans were to enjoy an excellent dinner and then head over to the Mirage to watch Cirque's LOVE show.    I had originally made the reservation for 9, but ended up calling two more times to change the party number.  Every time I called, the hostess didn't have a problem with it.  On the last phone call, I even told her that we were celebrating multiple birthdays, and she said it was no problem, and to see tell her the birthday people when I got there.  I even asked if a reservation at 6:30 would be enough time for our 9:30 showing, and was told we had plenty of time for dinner.   The reservation was made for 6:30 PM on Saturday evening, and our entire of party of 13 showed up by 6:40 PM.  We weren't seated until 7:00, but we didn't mind since we were taking pictures and chit-chatting amongst ourselves in the waiting area.  During this time, the hostess was kind enough to point out our waiter to me so that I could let him know who the three birthdays were.  After we were seated, the waiter introduced himself, the menus, and the drink menu.  I slipped him a piece of paper with a diagram of our table, and indicated where the three people were seated.  He looked at it for a second, realized what it was, give me a smile and nod, and tucked it away.    Everyone in our party knew pretty quickly what we were going to order, so when asked for our drinks, we went ahead and put in our orders as well.  At around 7:30 PM though, we noticed a large crowd of people filing into a curtained off section.  We assumed it was a group affiliated with a convention of some sort, and guesstimated about 70 or so people to be there.  They were loud and having a good time, with lots of cheering and applause.  Our party had fun with it at first, cheering and clapping along.  But after the fifth time of a rousing chorus of cheers and claps, it did start to get old.  Nonetheless, the appetizers came (for those that ordered them), and we all got distracted by taking pictures and tasting the yummy concoctions.  The Maryland Jumbo Lump Crab Cake were truly jumbo shrimp (Yummy!), and the tomato soups and onion soups were cleaned to the last drop.  We noticed the time around 8:15 though, and we were wondering why we hadn't gotten our food yet.  Yes, we were a big party, but it had been a good 45 minutes since we had ordered.  We asked our waiter about it, and he said it should be done soon, and he'd check up on it.  8:30 came around, and still no sign of our food.  (We noticed our waiter was going in and out of the kitchen a good number of times - he was looking pretty concerned himself.)  Slowly, the conversation at the table turned to the fact that our food was still not here yet, and that we had to leave around 9 to get back to the Strip.  Finally at 8:40, our food came out and our waiter apologized for the wait, explaining that the kitchen had gotten backlogged due to the other large party.  Everyone at the table was a bit miffed - the restaurant knew well in advance that there were two large parties coming!  Between the 13 of us, we had gotten every cut of steak on the menu, the sea bass, and the veal chops.  We also ordered sides of mashed potatoes, truffle fries, mac and cheese, grilled asparagus, and creamed corn.  We all enjoyed what we order (and impressed with the size of the bone-in ribeye), and the sides were delicious.  (The mac and cheese, truffle fries, and creamed corn were devoured!)    Having said that we enjoyed the food, it was as much as you can enjoy scarfing down food within 20 minutes... We were very disappointed that we couldn't enjoy the food in a leisurely manner, but we all commented on how good the food was.  HOWEVER... not a single plate came with the sides that were included (mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables.)  That was another big oversight of the kitchen that we weren't thrilled with.    As we rushed to settle the bill, the waiter came by to ask us what to do about the birthday people.  I was really sad to tell him that we unfortunately didn't have time - we had to get going to make the show. But in waiting for the taxis to arrive, our waiter surprised us and was able to get three desserts packaged in to go boxes!   In the taxi ride back to the strip, we commented on the quality of the food, and that it really was very unfortunate that we weren't able to have a proper experience at ENVY.  We all agree that while there was a definite lack of foresight from management  to be unable to juggle two large parties, we would definitely have to go back again to give ENVY a second chance with the amazing food that we had.", "Date": "2010-02-03", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Anna", "ReviewID": "sJQFlBAVHOjvr14ZesJzQQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Brunch for $30 a person in Vegas can either be a heavenly steal or a wasted money nightmare in which you find yourself squeezed in between overweight,  starved  tourists wanting to maximize quantity for their buck.  Envy was luckily the former. We were here for brunch on Halloween and enjoyed the atmosphere of regulars being dressed up and mingling in large groups of friends and family.   Brunch here includes unlimited champagne or mimosas - never a good idea when a Russian and a German come in, we will destroy your bubbly supply! Our server caught on soon that we take unlimited to heart and she rapidly refilled our flutes every few minutes. Empty plates were also removed swiftly each time we ventured out to the buffet again. If you don't care for champagne all that much, just go wild at the build-your-own bloody mary bar!  The selection of food was great. It wasn't a mass-appeal kind of buffet, but rather a well-rounded selection of top notch items. The omelet station had any ingredient you could possibly want from jalapenos to applewood smoked bacon. My favorite was the large plate tower of chilled crab legs and shrimp. I was missing my tartar sauce however, I don't care for cocktail sauce.  Envy's carved prime rib is possibly the best one I have ever had. Too bad I targeted the lunch-type food last, I couldn't have more than a slice. I'll save some more space for it next time I'm here.  One thing that gets me to completely ignore calories, carbs and sugar overdoses at buffets are the desserts. Most buffets have those cute little shot glass desserts and I generally take about 10 different kinds until I need to be rolled out of the restaurant. Envy had a smaller than usual dessert selection, but it did not disappoint! The bread pudding topped with raspberries had me zone out until the last crumb was devoured.

Overall the food was pretty good & the portions generous, but what really made this place worth it was the service, the atmosphere & just the experience of it! Our server daunte was awesome, he bent over backwards for us to accommodate our various requests. As what other yelpers wrote, they brought us a complimentary champagne toast and a happy anniversary dessert , the manager also personally came over and delivered a hand written happy anniversary card to us and her & the chef personally greeted us happy anniversary...the added personal touch was just the cherry on top! The staff here at envy really do know how to make you feel special. I did hint though that we were celebrating our anniversary (wink, wink) so if you are wanting to celebrate a special event, this place is top on my list, nice place, great food, reasonable princess, awesome service, what more could you ask for? I know there are some negative comments, but this is my advice to you, YOU are responsible for making YOUR experience positive or negative, it is all about attitude, do not let the pessimists sway your decisions, am glad I didn't.", "Date": "2012-03-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Real", "ReviewID": "9vb2YWWi0PgY_Vw-PdciyQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Best experience I have been too made Valentine's Day extra special.

I am all torn up inside about this restaurant.  Well, it's not that dramatic but I do think food quality ranges from nearly excellent to meh.    Breakfast is served here from 6:30-noon.  Coffee was pretty good and so was that complimentary smoothie thing.  Steak and eggs were awesome for $21.  The steak was so good and tender I thought I should come back for dinner...and I did.   For dinner I ordered the 17 ounce bone in ribeye medium rare.  The edges were flavorful and tender but as I got closer to the bone it was chewy like too much gristle.  Only the edges were good the rest was yucks.  Also the dinner steak is finished in some demi-glaze sauce that does nothing but ruin the texture.  Just finish it with clarified butter I say!  My dinner cost three times as much as my breakfast but it was unfortunately NOT 3 times as good.    One thing that is consistent is the good attentive service.  The staff is really nice and thoughtful.

Honestly, this is a steakhouse trying to be a Mastro's...which I can understand, but it still has some ways to go. Overall, we were all just  okay  with our meals, though one of my girls had to send her order back. Let me go over what we had:  Salmon: A bit on the dry side for me, but I can make a killer salmon dish so I may just be picky. The sweet pea puree was for the most part, tasteless with the exception of a grassy (mint-y?) random herb that I picked up randomly from the puree. The peas were nice and fresh though.The pork belly bits under the salmon were overly salty, and it was a bit too much zing on the taste buds to complement the salmon, which was seasoned just right. The puree did help with the dryness, but it shouldn't have been necessary.   Lamb rack: This dish was actually okay, and made just right for the bf. Quality-wise, we've had better for the price, but it was decent.   Bone in: My two friends who ordered steaks were like  ...that's it?  because presentation-wise, it really was just a slab of meat on a plate. Sure, it's what they ordered, but there was no wow factor at all compared to Ruth Chris or even Houston's. The steaks were definitely edible, but once again, not very melt-in-your-mouth or orgasmic flavor explosion. They were just steaks. Steaks that I could probably make better at home, but eh, we were away so we'll make do.  French onion soup: My friend expected crunchier croutons, but they were actualy incorporated into the soup and made into soggy bread bits along with her measly looking cheese on top. Once again, no wow factor, and even when she got it I could tell she already looked disappointed. However, it was actually way too salty for her and she ended up getting a stomach ache and was sick the rest of the night, so we returned the order.  Truffle fries: Giant, clingy mass of cheese and oil. It didn't look classy for the restaurant at all, and it just looked like a heart attack mess waiting to happen. Granted, the truffle taste was strong and it was tasty, but the mixture of sodium and heavy, heavy grease just made it too hard to eat. We barely scarfed any of it down for fear of just feeling sick from all the fat.  Service was professional and courteous, and they did take the french onion soup off the check and gave us a side of mashed potatoes as the fries were taking a long time to come in, which was nice. Overall though, I don't think I'd pay what I did to be back.", "Date": "2015-04-26", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "A", "ReviewID": "_-TUU6YyasID6vtsJ8tpoQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "The caesar salad was surprisingly very tasty.

To my surprise when we got there they had the personalized menu greeting him happy birthday.   Our server was very pleasant and gave us some great suggestions on the wine. We got a nice bottle of cabernet. We ordered the calamari and rock shrimp for appetizer. We got the 40 oz Tomahawk ribeye and garlic mash potatoes.   The appetizer was ok, more salty than I would like and the shrimp tasted weird. The steak was delicious, it had that nice grill taste and a demiglaze that was not too overwhelming for the steak. It was a very big portion that we had left overs. The garlic mash potatoes were also very good.   As a bonus they brought us out a toffee dessert thing for his birthday.   The service here is amazing. Starting with personalized menu, the dessert, and then they even gave him a card to wish a happy birthday.  It's off the strip located at the Renaissance.

SOLD!   Our reservation was for 9:30 pm and arrived on time to a near empty restaurant.  Once we walked into the lobby of the Renaissance my fiance (wow that's weird to say) says to me,  is this place open?   I was nervous that we were the only ones there but there were a few other tables.  Phew!    I took the pleasure in purchasing via Restaurant.com a $75 gift certificate for $9. Ah, yeah...$9!!!  What a deal!  The catch was we had to spend $150 (includes alcohol!)  to have the GC apply.  No problem!    Food: *Surf & Turf - a GIANT 19 oz. bone in Rib Eye with scallops.   Very very tender & juicy rib eye cooked medium rare (woot woot!) served with three succulent scallops all cooked to perfection.    *Bourbon Creamed Corn. OMG.  Serious goodness here!  The best creamed corn I have ever tasted.  Ever!  (better than Lawry's....shhhh you didn't hear me say that!)  *Bacon and Gruyere Mac & Cheese. One word....WOW!  Drink: *Bottle of Red S. Australian wine.  Perfect.  The only complaint we had was that we knew we would fill up fast.  We both slapped our tummies and psyched them into a few extra bites.    Food = great.   Decor = beautiful and comfortable  Service =  unpretentious  TIPs:   1. If you cab it here, make sure to get his card so you can call him to pick you up.  There's not much activity here so set up your ride beforehand.    2. Check out Restaurant.com's site and sign up for their emails.

They wanted to take me to a Japanese restaurant for dinner but the Las Vegas strip was close and jammed.  Upscale restaurants required reservation or have at least 1-2 hours wait time.  Since this steakhouse is within the hotel I'm staying, I suggested we try this place instead.  We had no reservation but the gentleman host ushered us right in. I did informed him I was a guest in their hotel so I don't know if this is why we were able to get a table without reservation or was it just not busy? We were dressed for the occasion that evening.  Everyone was absolutely at their best.  Service was tops. Food was amazing.  Our 2nd visit here was unplanned.  We were unprepared;  was dressed in Jeans, t-shirts/polo shirt, tennis shoes and a hat (long night) but we were still accommodated very well.  The lady host ushered us in without issues.  No sniding looks or attitude, she was actually very friendly.  Servers was just as friendly.  Food was again amazing (most part).    PROS: - Mac and triple cheese absolutely delicious. - Pan seared sea bass was amazing - I enjoyed the bold bursting flavor of the truffled crust.   - Roasted butternut squash soup was my toddler's fav. here. - Very friendly, attentive, well converse and lively servers.   - 3 kinds of seasoned salts (loved the Australian flavor best) - Upscale with warm traditional decor - Elegant food presentation, as expected.     CONS: - Filet Mignon was just a bit above average.  Yes, flavor was there; prepared and cooked well but it did not really impress me.  Maybe I was just expecting more.  I was hoping for something exciting, a bolder flavor or something different than other upscale steak house out there.    - VERY LIMITED choices in the menu.  They did not have a lot of beef steak choices or variety in there menu that weekend I visited.  There's only 2 types of beef steaks  (inbone rib eye and filet mignon) But they do have 3 types seafood in the menu (Seabass, tiger shrimp and salmon).  What's up with that?  I was informed by the server that they do have New York steak even if it was not in the menu but I don't care much for New York steak.  I wanted porterhouse, TBone or other great cuts.  There's no exotic meats like venison's or bison's cuts here either.  There's also no house special cut or house seasoned steak like some upscale steakhouses.  I guess I expected more considering the price range...   I did ask the server why their menu was so limited, he informed me that they actually have more but just not in the menu at that time. He informed me that this is to make room for New years special - The 3-5 courses meal special.  It's was written on the right hand side of the menu.  Maybe they need to have a 2-3 pages menu instead?  I'm guessing this will change after the holiday.  - Very simple and ordinary dessert menu. Although, I did enjoy their creme brulee, the cheesecake and the bittersweet lava cake was mediocre at best.  Again, if I'm  paying this much, I have higher expectations.    BOTTOM LINE:  A high 3's or 4 stars overall.  This restaurant is a great experience.  No regrets on my part.  Will I come back here again?  Yes but there is soooooo many interesting, competitive and amazing restaurants in Las Vegas that I want to TRY first.  In the meantime, this steakhouse is a one-timer (or two) in my book, FOR NOW anyways.", "Date": "2012-02-21", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Kyle", "ReviewID": "vLOif1-ZnR_kCFX8euLsDg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "This place was absolutly awesome.
