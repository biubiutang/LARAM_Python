Parking was a pain not to mention everyone was driving wayyy too fast. Before entering I already saw a huge line but I went in anyways!   I saw on their menu that they have a 2 for 6.99 deal going on. So I got the broccoli cheddar, Caesar salad, and baguette. As for a drink I just got a cup of water since its free and it doesn't taste like sink water lol.  Wondering why I only gave three stars? Not because of the line and not because of the parking lot. I knocked off two stars all because of their CRAPPY Caesar Salad! The lettuce was BROWN! & the good colored lettuce is that part that taste like water. Not to mention was barely any dressing so I was basically chewing water =\ oh oh and I cannot forget the croutons..wow that thing was STALE.    The soup on the other hand was SO GOOD. I wish I had gone with my initial thought which was to get a bread bowl. The cherry on top was the baguette though! I just love dipping bread into soup and eating it!

The staff...I am not exaggerating when I say I have rarely been in here and not encountered at least one employee who seems uninterested and/or miserable.   I often will stand at the front ordering counter for long periods even after people, who I see working the front counter later,  clearly see me, making eye contact but do not even address me.

The restaurant is gorgeous, very peaceful, lots of seating,  and clean, but I was kind of underwhelmed. While my ham & swiss sandwich was fine, it was definitely not worth $6.80.  Maybe $4.00 at best. I'm sure that I was paying for the overhead, not for the food.  I know it is a step up from fast food, but I felt like I could have easily made this in my kitchen.

I don't like how they don't serve their soup first thing in the morning. You have to wait til 9 or 10. I've gotten a couple of bagels that were burnt (not extremely but burnt enough). Sometimes their bread is also tough. However, most times their food is good.   Service is okay. A lot of the workers here aren't very... Welcoming. Some don't know how to smile.

Starbucks style.  Negatives: Didn't LOVE this location (Experienced way better locations), particular location was too busy, dirty, no effort in food preparation.   I find the Panera Bead Chain to be AWESOME. Great place to casually meet up with friends for a light lunch. Great place to meet up with someone you just met. Unfortunately I didn't have a great experience with this location. The lady who brought me my lunch also was sweeping the floors. Dishes were stacked high at the trash cans. Lines to order were 7 people deep, food took a while to get to me considering I only ordered a half a sandwich and some soup. Crazy how busy this location was for a Tuesday afternoon.  Price/Food: $10-15 Lunch. Food is always really light and refreshing at Panera Bread. Its basic safe ground for your picky eaters. In my opinion the food is a little bit pricey for the quantity, type of food, and preparation effort you are getting. I paid $12 for a half a sandwich, a bowl of french onion soup, and a soda. Was not so impressed with this particular location. Spoon was not very clean and had water spots, sandwich was very tiny and falling apart (3 big bites for a guy), and soup was just warm. I asked for the soup croutons on the side and they gave me about 4 croutons in a soup container. They didn't even bother to cut my bread in half. They just ripped a chunk off the loaf. I do however like how Panera Bread uses real cuts of turkey, and not the thin sliced pressed stuff.  Service/Ambiance: I like how the cashiers are separate from food preparation area. As busy as this location was, the cashier took the time to answer my questions and offer and explain to me about their rewards card. The customer service was spot on and everyone was friendly, but the food took forever to come out. This location cannot keep up with the amount of people that are coming through. Tables were dirty, floors had trash, trash cans were over flowing. Parking lot was packed. But on a positive note; there is a burger place next door, and a Panda express next door to that, with tables all outside, for those times when each person is in the mood for something different.", "Date": "2014-04-24", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Rithy", "ReviewID": "CGqpB78X7NM9omx3lf411Q", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Panera, thank you so much for the amazing dinner I just had with my bestfriend.

It was the end of the day but they were still very gracious about us being there. Shawn or Sean brought my food over and the guy literally had to walk back and forth 3 times to get me the things I needed and he gave me an apple. I just had a really pleasant visit after a long day from work and I really appreciated the customer care that they provided.  A little nice gesture goes a long way. Thank you.

Laugh if you must, but good iced tea is important to this Texan. It can make or break my day.    If I'm out and about and needing something to drink it's good to know there's someplace out there offering top notch, gourmet restaurant style iced tea for an affordable price.  At Panera you can get a large cup to go for a couple bucks. They've got mango (my favorite), regular unsweetened, and a tropical hibiscus, if your into that.  When they've got it in stock, there's nothing better around, and they keep the flavor pretty consistent.  I say  when  they've got it in stock because sometimes they run out and I don't realize this til after I've paid. I've made a habit out of checking the tea urns to see if their full before ordering.  Most of the time I get lucky though!  I'm not sure I can recommend the food. I haven't tried much.  I had a soufflé not too long ago, and it made a really decent breakfast for the price. Every time I've visited after, however, they've been sold out of these, so get here early if you're interested. Everything else I've had has just been so-so.  They do an excellent job at making you want every pastry and treat they offer. The display case is set up really nice and it's hard to pass up their sweets, or not order some form of bread selection from the wall.  I had a bagel the other day that had an okay taste, but was hard to chew. I'm not sure if it was way over toasted, or just really old. Either way, I don't think I'll order a bagel anytime soon.  The M&M cookie I tried had a burnt butter taste, and I didn't enjoy their cheese Danish either.  Definitely come here sometime because it's a really nice store and a decent place to hang out with family or co-workers and talk. There's free wifi, which is never a thing to pass up.

And this is my favorite Panera location in town.   The staff is always very friendly and helpful, and I even when I go during the lunch rush there is rarely a long wait. The eating area is kept clean, the only thing that could make this panera better is the parking area can get a little crazy at times.   I don't particularly care for the  soup schedule  (soups that are available one day aren't necessarily available the following day), but it is very rare that Panera doesn't have a soup that appeals to me every time I go in. And I really love that the employees will let you sample the soups if you are having a hard time deciding which to get!  Nine times out of ten, I go with the 'Pick 2', which allows you to select soup and half a sandwich, or soup and salad, or 2 soups, or a sandwich and salad... you get the idea. I've never been disappointed with what I ordered in terms of flavor or portion size.   I typically get my food to go from Panera, but every so often I eat in and this is a pretty cozy spot to do so.

Will probably continue to go to the boca park location from now on.", "Date": "2013-10-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Minnie", "ReviewID": "kkVIKZQK_UqfZpnRivQwMQ", "Overall": "3", "Content": "First of all, I'd like to start off with the fact that I love Panera Bread. Soups, salads, breads, and pastas are my ultimate comfort food and this location is conveniently less than five minutes away, so it does sadden me quite a bit to be giving them a three-star rating. For that, I will start with the good stuff:  The food is fresh, filling, and of great taste. The ingredients always deliver quality! The atmosphere includes cozy tungsten lighting and several booths amongst the (kind of) crowded tables and chairs; however, I am knocking off points for this location's service. The time of day definitely matters. I've been here enough to know that sometimes there's a bit of a wait for even the simplest of orders. There was even a circumstance in which someone in my party was told they were out of one of his orders and this would have been completely fine if he was told immediately, but he was told after a twenty-minute wait which meant he had to wait even longer. We were forced to eat ahead of him to avoid dining on cold soup. *tear*  Other than that, Panera's a pretty decent spot to have a healthy meal! I would have given them a four-star rating if it weren't for the service... I do love all of their soups and the Iced Green Tea is a must for those who like a refreshingly sweet beverage! The  You Pick 2  is also perfect for numerous combinations!", "Date": "2013-09-30", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Peter", "ReviewID": "7FlfGJa2KiFqDKKUM3gcvA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "When you get 5 Starr help.

Last couple times I've gone here have been nothing but crappy. First time they don't have the soup I want so okay whatever I leave. Second time they have the soup I want, but ran out of bread bowls so I left. Third time (which was today) they finally have the soup and bread bowl combination I've been dying for, and then they forget my side.

We ordered two soups, bread, Mac n cheese, and two cookies. (The restaurant was out of bread bowls, which was a real letdown.) What was completely ridiculous was how we ended up with a bunch of random soups, no bread and no cookies. It was as if the people at Panera weren't even trying to get our order right. What a disappointment. We certainly won't be going back to Panera again.", "Date": "2014-09-27", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Alexander", "ReviewID": "IdXXIsmiHlMNh8rFKSsOgQ", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Panera Bread is just OK to me. I really don't understand the hype behind it which is why I generally don't eat here to often. Last night I was craving a good salad and sand which. Was being pretty lazy and Panera Bread was really the only thing open around my area. So I stopped in and waited for about 5 minutes until I had to walk up to the counter on the other side and ask if anybody was taking orders. Not very attentive to your customers I see.. The girl who took my order was somewhat helpful with my questions on certain items on the menu. I would say overall my experience could've been better and also I would say that the meal was pretty basic. $18 later I almost feel like I should've drove a little further for something different.", "Date": "2015-11-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "dXp5Fkrjdh2aaNVvqr1XGg", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Some of my co-workers rave about Panera Bread incessantly.  They eat here several times a week and swear Panera is the best thing since sliced bread.   I finally joined them for lunch yesterday and my unbiased opinion is... meh.   Nothing was terrible but I just don't see what the fuss is about.   First, the prices are higher than I would expect for soup, salad and sammies.   I had a flatbread chicken sandwich that was decent, but small for the price.  The salad was good, but my mind wasn't blown.   I guess for around $11 I expected more.    For the price, I think Café Zupas offers better food and portions.
