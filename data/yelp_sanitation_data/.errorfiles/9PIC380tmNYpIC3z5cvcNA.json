The sauce that you pour on top was a bit strange. IT's okay. The crepe cake itself was nothing to get excited about.

From an aesthetic perspective, this place does have cute vibes. It has mismatched tables and chairs which you find at a lot of coffee shops nowadays. Also the place is nice and clean with big windows.   The desserts I've had so far have been quite good. My personal favorite, the banoffee, is especially yummy. The crepe cake I loved when I first ordered it since I had never had anything like it, but at subsequent visits it's become less and less appealing to me personally. It tastes mostly like layered whip cream. The drinks are okay. My mango iced tea was delicious, but my coffee was extremely bitter even with cream and sugar.  One event that did ruin this place for me was when I checked their hours online and saw they would be open til 12 am. My boyfriend and I arrived there at 11 pm where we were greated by a sign on the front door that said  New hours! Open til 1 am!  So obviously, we were like  great!  and proceeded to attempt to place an order. The two male employees there made eye contact with us when we walked in, then proceeded to ignore us for a good two minutes while we waited to place our order. Finally, one of them acknowledged us and said,  We're closing soon. The kitchen is closed.  I was flabbergasted and thoroughly annoyed, not just that their hours were all over the place, but more so that they let us stand there for two minutes before telling us we wouldn't be served.  Honestly that experience has led me to go elsewhere to fulfill my sweet tooth cravings. Definitely overhyped.", "Date": "2016-09-20", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Kit", "ReviewID": "ezDs78scqReaBfEJYhPVzg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Matcha Cake w/ green tea sauce was soooo good!

It's a good place to have a drink or dessert while hanging out with friends or just studying alone. I love how cute the atmosphere and decor is. We are all obsessed with the green tea crepe! We get it every single time we go. I also had their honey toast, and I like how they put light honey on it, then have extra honey on the side so it's not overly sweet if you don't want it to be. I wish there were more choices with the drinks because sometimes I just want a regular milk tea, but they still have a good selection of other flavors. I honestly feel like some of their teas and fraps could taste better, but I mainly come here for their desserts. I'm still a fan and will continue to come back.

Food and drinks can be described as  is okay    it's hard to mess up anything with sugar and high calories but the part that turned me off about this place was when the man ringing us up asked  if we wanted ice cream with the cake we said sure so they added a very very small scoop of low quality ice cream to our plate. He then told me the total I don't remember the exact amount maybe close to 20 with 2 drinks and 1 green tea cake to share.  I gladly handed my card... Well I guess the guy (the owner I think )didn't ring up the ice cream side so he came over to our table to demand our payment of 1 or 2 bucks more because he forgot to ring up the ice cream side!! I have no problem with the amount or paying but as we're eating he interrupted us and made me get up and leave my table to go up to the counter to pay again all over 2bucks max... Really?? it was his mistake! You're that cheap !? was it really worth rudely interrupting my date and I's conversation and making us get up from our seats demanding me to pay you 2 bucks more when it was your fault to begin with, he didn't even apologize !?

A place where you can sit with your mason jar full of iced coffee with a straw (instead of standing awkwardly in the corner somewhere of a crowded Starbucks) and stare into the mountains (seriously, there's a view).   Ordered the 24oz iced coffee on a weekday afternoon. The one barista working was busy and it took some time for him to get to me but he had a smile on his face the entire time which seemed to just melt any ounce of impatience I had away. I typically down my tall coffees from Starbucks within seconds, so I was pretty happy knowing I still had coffee left after 3 hours of sitting on my bum.

It's definitely a nice place to hang out with friends or do some work since they offer free WiFi. I didn't try any of their beverages, but I indulged in two of their well-known treats.  Red Velvet Crepe Cake ($6.50): Definitely pretty with the contrasting red and white layers and as a crepe cake, decent, however, there was zero flavor suggesting  Red Velvet.  Obviously, the draw of this is the fact that it is red velvet and it's unfortunately a sham. It's randomly served with a strawberry preserve. Hard pass.  Honey Toast with Strawberries, Condensed Milk, Vanilla Ice Cream ($7.00): You can order Honey Toast as is ($4), but I don't think it would be very tasty by itself. It definitely needs toppings. I was concerned at first since the toast isn't sliced into pieces and not what I'm used to, but the elements were all there. Lightly toasted fluffy, chewy bread; drizzled honey, and I really enjoyed the combination of my toppings. There are a lot of toppings to choose. Condensed Milk is highly recommended.", "Date": "2016-07-10", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Julie", "ReviewID": "bXjcgcKuO9b1XaEcKT7lkg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Ended up trying it the same day my friend posted an IG about this place. Great little cafe to chill with a few friends. Definitely do not recommend a big group as seating is limited.   Presentation is really nice and I was pleased with the service. The guy informed me of some specials and that's when I remembered they had crepes.   Crepes - two flavor: vanilla and green tea. I did get the green tea and one of my friends got the vanilla but I preferred the vanilla in the end. Green tea is a hit or miss for me sometimes depending on what it is.   There's a lot of drink choices that I had to take more than a few minutes to decide. Ended up with mango fruit smoothie but probably would not get that again.

Cute, quiet tea/coffee shop. Adorable desserts in the display case. It was late, and quiet in there with only one other table occupied. I ordered a cup of tea and a honey toast with sweetened condensed milk, strawberry, banana and vanilla ice cream (as per the recommendation of the gentleman who took my order).

Two popular desserts: - 6.50 for crepe cake (Vanilla, matcha, or red velvet)  - 4.00 for honey toast base, toppings range from .50 to 1.26 - big variety of coffee and hot tea available   Small staff is very nice. IS SWEET has a small, family-owner vibe to it.   This place barely missed the mark, but the honey toast was not cooked completely through after coming out of the freezer and still had that undone/overly chewy bread thing going on at some parts instead of being crisp and caramelized.

The good thing about this café right now is that if you but a cake or toast and a drink you get 10% discount which isn't much, but it's pretty good!

I've liked the matcha and sesame milk teas, but the latte wasn't really anything out of the ordinary. Because the matcha is powder based, it is a bit grainy as you drink it, and same with the sesame too with a bit more sweetness. Their green tea crepe cake was okay. If you've ever had Lady M's crepe cake, you'll think this one doesn't quite come close. The flavor isn't too bad, but more so the texture is a bit off. The crepe part of the cake has a hint of almost a playdoh texture...and just the green color of it isn't so much a matcha green, but a pine green food coloring.

Also, the crepe is softer in consistency so it's easily sliced and has more melts-in-your-mouth texture when you bite. The service is quick and the cashier was respectful and friendly. The food presentation is excellent. Two things  why I'm giving it a 4, those are 1) the unnatural green color shade of the green tea which makes me think if they really used the natural matcha green tea powder. 2) I noticed a tiny white hair strand in in my ice cream scoop.

Yes, this shop is kind of hidden.. But the flags they have out front that advertise this business helps a lot.   My first visit here I showed up at around 20 minutes after they had opened. I was expecting to try their green tea crepe cake but the only choices they had that were ready was the coffee cake, and the melted cheesecake. Not quite sure if it's a limited choice every morning.. But I ended up getting the coffee cake. As far as the drinks, there are so many choices to choose from! Coffee, tea, and smoothies! I decided to go with the iced white mocha.   The icing (which was actually butter cream) on coffee cake was pretty hard to eat at first because it  came straight from the fridge. It didn't really taste that good at first.  I'm no pastry chef or a baker or anything... So I didn't know I had to wait till the cake wasn't so cold so the butter cream would soften up (the lady who took my order had explained that after I took a few bites from the cake). And man.. It tasted waaay better. Was not disappointed with the cake after that!   The white mocha. I usually try to avoid ordering a white mocha because a lot of times it comes out too sweet. But! It just sounded delicious at the time so I got it! :D This drink was well balanced and had just the right amount of sweet. I enjoyed it very much!   Most of their tables seat up to like 3 people.

The Green Tea Crepe Cake was very delicate and the green tea cremé that they give you lets you take control over your own sweetness, which I thought was classy. The cake itself is done very well and is not overly sweet. They pride themselves in their plate presentation here so don't expect each Green Tea Crepe Cake to come out looking the same!

Considering my two companions are not hardcore sweet fanatics but very hard to please, we all left blown away.   It is hard to find the location cause it's tucked away in the corner of a plaza. But I liked that it was not too crowded with restaurants and parking was not tight either.  The first visit we my bff and I ordered four things:  Lychee tea and mango tea: (so I wanted a tea with lemon and the only one on the menu like that was the Thai tea with lemon but I'm not a big fan of Thai tea.  I asked the guy at the register and he recommended the mango tea to me) Both were sooo refreshing! She agreed the lychee drink was probably one of the best she's gotten. I got the mango and it wasn't exactly thick like filipino mango juice, not too tart and sweet. Both drinks didnt have that artificial syrupy sugary aftertaste some places that use syrup have. There were also small pulps  of fresh lychee and mango pieces in the bottom of our drinks! Both served ice cold too.  2/4 items ordered approved so far. Now moving onto dessert.  Green tea Mille crepe cake: This was my first time ordering a crepe cake. I've had crepes before and I was expecting it to be a little heavy cause they are multiple layers of the crepe making up the crepe. Tasted the green tea sauce first which i think to be an anglaise. The green tea was creamy just like how i like it to be. Sometimes some places use green tea that have that jasmine taste but not in this case which i was relieved. The cake itself was melt in your mouth smooth and delicious. Perfectly well balanced, and again, had the right amount of sweetness. The matcha was subtle and not overpowering and the whipped creme wasn't super sweet either. Love love love. The sauce goes well with the cake and the accompanying fruits too.  3/4 items check! We held our breath for the final taste test to seal the deal--  Cheesecake:  (So i asked the guy if the tiramisu was made with ladyfingers and marscapone cheese like it should be and he said yes. There's only one other place in vegas we've gotten tiramisu that was made right and wanted to try this one made at an Asian cafe for authenticity. Most places will try to use cream cheese or cake is why. So we ordered tiramisu with her drink cause we couldn't decide between the cheesecake and tiramisu. What arrived at our table was the cheesecake lol but we were so happy with our drinks we didn't catch on the mistake at first) Anyways! the bite of cheesecake was legit I tell you. She agreed it tasted like real NY style cheesecake. Nice and firm, not overtly sugar laden and was creamy but not too too heavy.   4/4 items check!  Halfway through the cheesecake we finally wondered what happened to the tiramisu. Realized he gave us the cheesecake instead. We were kind of full at this point but we were still interested in tasting it. We went for the final stretch of approval. Would we get an authentic tasting tiramisu from an Asian cafe?? So we got it lol  Tiramisu: And omg the first bite sealed the deal. The ladyfingers  in the bottom was soaked in the right amount of coffee liquor. Marscapone cheese was set correctly. Overall, I didn't think it possible but yep, the tiramisu certainly passed! It was a whopping 5/5!! ---- Second visit with the bf late at night we got the passion fruit tea, had him try the green tea crepe cake and a honey toast with just vanilla.   He said the passion tea was amazing. I thought it was a little on the sweeter side but he said it was perfect. The honey toast he loved. He noted that it wasnt doused with honey like other places. The whipped creme was lightly sweetened and mellowed out the sweetness of the honey and ice cream. The crepe cake he complimented that it was no cake like he ever tried before and was astonished it was just layers of paper thin crepe and lightly sweetened creme.  Overall, yes it was another 3/3 approval from the both of us. Props for consistency!!  Service was great and the lady behind the counter was very friendly and answered our questions. She even let us know where they purchased all their cute serving utensils and dishware which are so cute I wish I could take them home lol. I will purchase them for  sure now that i know where to find them :p  Plus free wifi! Pw is posted near the register, I think it was  sweetcoffee  if memory serves correctly.

I was hoping for a savory something to eat, but obviously with a name like IS SWEET, I shouldn't have been so optimistic. I took the cashier's advice and went with the Honey Toast over a waffle and an Iced Americano.   The iced Americano was very good. Most places don't have the proper gear to provide a solid espresso drink, but IS SWEET pulls it off nicely. No funky or burnt aftertaste, pure caffeinated bliss.  The Honey Toast here might as well be the Incredible Hulk of breakfast breads. Think thick like Texas Toast and sweet like Hawaiian bread. Then cover that in Nutella and a vanilla pudding with side of whipped cream. Yowza, food can get you sexually charged. Not only did I eat the entire thing, I pretty much inhaled it with about three bites. I'm not a sugar lover so; you can imagine how good this dish is.   The bottom of the Honey Toast was crispy from being lightly fried, but the middle of the bread was so airy and soft, that the drizzle on top slowly weighed it down and actually had the bread dipping in the center.

Layers of crepe sandwiching sweet cream, together with the ice cream, and matcha sauce all created an orchestra of flavor! It was amazing. It was also served with berries to help break some of the green tea flavor. But wow was it good.

(There were also no empty tables at the time when he told us to move)  Now, I've been to my fair share of cafes of all kinds and NEVER NEVER NEVER have I been told I need to give up my seat to make room for a bigger party (aka more $$$) Yes, a cafe is a business and business is business, but how is this the way to treat your customers?  Sorry to the bigger party, but could they not have gotten their drinks to go? Or sat separately?  To be fair, he came over one more time when we were packing up and offered to put some tables together for us. I was already in a sour mood and wanted to get out of there already. Didn't even finish my slushie. :(  We confronted the waiter about it afterwards and there was back and forth arguing that I would rather not get into.   Bottom line, my experience was a big no no in my book. I am very glad that others have had positive experiences here. I really was enjoying myself up until we were told to move or leave.

I mean, any more 'flavor' and I'd be having me some diabetes. My favorite is the green tea. Also, even though the ice cream is an extra charge, my expert opinion is for you to get it. It just makes it better.   Drinks are not really the forte of IS SWEET. I don't like the boba or the coffee. But I did order the mango smoothie and loved it! It had the 3 things that a proper smoothie -should- have: It was fresh, it was made of real mango (not artificial, thank godd!!), and it gave me a brain freeze.

To the far right of the counter are the desserts consisting of NY cheesecakes, tiramisu, coffee cake and creme brulee...which I found oddly placed at the end hidden by a few tables and chairs.  Usually when you have pastries, you would want it to be one of the first things your consumer sees and not the last.   On this particular visit, our order consisted of a vanilla crepe cake, tiramisu, creme brulee, thai lemon tea, kiwi tea and a mango tea. The cake was pretty good, as well as the tiramisu.  The creme brulee fell short on the texture as it was close to being runny and grainy.  The tea however was the best part of the entire visit. The thai lemon iced tea was great and I could literally order gallons of this for summer.   We arrived around 930-945pm and they had already sold out of the green tea crepe cake.

The place is very decorative, they a red brick wall with some frames and also some shelving work with some nice designs hanging.  They have your standard table but they also have a mini table which felt like I was having tea and a playhouse.   On to the food. We ordered a taro flavored frappe and it tasted ok. Nothing really special about it so we give that one 3/5. However, We also ordered a honey toast with ice cream and bananas and that was so delicious! The bread was perfectly baked, ice cream was firm and creamy, and the bananas were flavorful. They also added some whip cream on the side which made the presentation appealing. We give this one a 5/5.   The only thing they could work on is possibly speeding up the foos making process, maybe have some more workers during night shift so that one person is not making all the food! It took a while for our honey toast to be ready!

Verdict: It was good... but my friend's honey toast was way better! You can add toppings and ice cream for extra. (Be warned that honey toast and waffle preparation could take 15 minutes, as a sign explicitly states) I couldn't even finish the crepe cake because it was so sweet and the consistency got tiring near the end. I also had their lychee iced tea served in the ever-present mason jar, but it's not something I'd come back for. However, the man who rung me up did tell me he can remake any drink if I didn't like it, but I just stuck with it.   The sparse decor is something you'd find in your crafty, yet slightly schizophrenic aunt's kitchen.

Their interior is Instagram-worthy and has lots of personality. They even have a small patio seating outside, unfortunately you only get a view of parking and apartment complex next door but is still nice to enjoy the fresh air.   A worker here told me their crepes are most popular dessert. They have the option of matcha, vanilla and red velvet. I have tried matcha and vanilla and have to say their matcha is my favorite. Crepe has multiple layers and looks beautiful. Texture is super creamy and velvety. Vanilla crepe came with a chocolate ice cream on the side and even with the same creamy texture, it didn't taste like vanilla.  As far as drinks goes, my most favorite is their iced chocolate. It's basically a hot chocolate poured over ice. It was so good my friend had finished her's in 5 min LOL  Lychee green tea is good if you want something refreshing, but make sure to ask for less sweet.   On one visit, a worker told me I can mix the flavors and that his favorite drink here is the strawberry lychee green tea. I asked for less sweet and it still came out really sweet. I enjoyed the small lychee pulp inside.   Service can be a little faster. They are friendly so I won't complain too much. I often see dirty dishes piling on tables which is not a good sign for me.

Once there, we noticed the sign that said no outside food or drink. I proceeded to order 3 honey toasts topped with ice cream. There were 6 of us and a small table outside with 2 chairs.  I went up to the counter, asked permission to bring our drinks in so we can eat our food at the table that sat 6. The guy said sure no problem. Now mind you, they DO NOT serve boba. After a few minutes the Asian guy came out and told us we had to leave our drinks out side or eat our food outside. Now, had there been seating for all of us, that would not have been a problem. I think what got me upset was the way he spoke to us, he was condescending - not rude but almost insulting. I told him to cancel my order and got my money back?

The presentation was gorgeous in a clear plastic glass with chocolate syrup artistically drizzled down the slides and topped with a generous dollop of whipped cream.  The drink was not too sweet but rich and decadent.  I was in chocolatey heaven.  I highly recommend this drink!   The chocolate mousse cake is shaped like an adorable little bear's head and It was so pretty I was hesitant to eat it.  Cracking the milk chocolate exterior revealed and rich and satisfying chocolate mousse atop a moist and chocolately disk of cake. It was absolutely delightful.    The strawberry cake was one of the best things I've ever eaten.  It was absolutely gorgeous with it's piped decorations, pocky sticks, and tiny chocolate hello kitty head.  The pink cake was layered with the most delicious cream filling and fresh strawberries.  It's like the best strawberry shortcake ever invented.  I wish I could eat one of these every day.

Believe the hype.  DESSERT We ordered the green tea crepe cake and the creme brulee to share. Both were so delicious. I especially enjoyed the green tea crepe cake because it was very light and not sweet, which I prefer.   DRINK The espresso machine was broken at the time so no coffee :(. But we ordered a pot of rose green tea to share and it was pretty standard. Good taste, not overpowering with floral scent but maybe too mild. Their lychee drink was refreshing, albeit a little sweet for me.  PRICE POINT I would say this place is a little pricey for the amount you get, especially for the tea. The teas are pretty expensive when they don't taste as such. The desserts obviously had a lot of care put into them so I wouldn't mind splurging every once in a while. It also helped that we went during the grand opening so our order was 30% off.  AMBIENCE & LOCATION The decor is very cutesy and comfortable, so you'll probably be seeing a lot of aerial photos on instagram. The place is small so it can't fit a lot of people, though there is a work table that fits 6. Everything about this place is adorable and it seems like your neighborhood cafe you would find somewhere more pedestrian-friendly than Vegas. Nice little patio outside and ample parking. Location is great -- not too difficult to find but just enough privacy.   SERVICE The owners are friendly and are quick to answer any questions.

Open late and offering free WiFi, the staff exceedingly pleasant if not particularly pressed for pace, those visiting IS SWEET are likely to be tempted by several cute confections in addition to honey toast and waffles made-to-order, the quoted preparation time of fifteen minutes proving a low-ball estimate as a lone barrista and man in the kitchen struggled with orders despite only a half-dozen total guests.  Levied a tab of $25.57 for four desserts and tap water before adding a tip, a tasting of IS SWEET began with a small slice of British favorite Banoffie Pie, the flavor of fruit largely overwhelming the toffee amidst the creamy base as drizzles of chocolate and caramel further compromised the experience, a block of honey toast proving far better crafted with a base price of $4.00 boosted by a $1.00 dollop of Vanilla pudding plus $1.25 for ice cream without which the toasted bread would seem to be a waste.  Taking two more treats for home, the Nutella Mousse apparently carrying a premium entirely as a result of the artistry involved, suffice it to say that at a cost of $6 the light dessert was most certainly not worth a buck-fifty a bite, the far better taste and value found in a 'coffee cake' that defied convention, the hefty notes of cinnamon smoothed by creamy frosting while honey glazed nuts added  texture and finesse traditionally reserved to fine-dining and plated sweets.  ***Unfortunately a bit too precious for its own good, even the honey toast which seems like a good deal turning out to be a bit pricey when accounting for portion after adding ice cream, IS SWEET is perhaps best visited with a group intent on sharing and sampling, though smallish portions may even make that a stretch.", "Date": "2015-12-08", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jewelyn", "ReviewID": "IZj7R1QcESxFKJj9BTq13A", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Cute dessert spot in Chinatown.

After reviewing the menu and having the owners give us some helpful tips, my fiancé and I decided on the matcha (green tea) frappe and the honeydew frappe. We also scored with the 30% yelp check-in offer. The frappé is slightly thicker than a slushy but smoother and lighter than a smoothie. First sips we were fans! Great, strong honeydew and matcha flavor. They had the perfect balance; not too icy or watered down and not obnoxiously sweet. They were perfect! They actually really reminded us of ice cream we would use to buy from the Asian market - very yummy and refreshing. I can definitely see us returning soon and many times when the desert summer heat hits.  Note: I'm comparing the matcha frappe here to the Madhouse Coffee's  matcha green tea smoothie  and also the  matcha ice blended  from The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf - their frappe version here stands up to those top competitors! A lovely and much cheaper version indeed.  We also tried the creme brûlée and it was torched with just the right amount of sugar, again not overly sweet, just right! They topped it with perfectly ripened berries and we savored every bite. I loved the creamy, custardy consistency - not to mention the serving size was decadent and perfect for two.  We saw other mini desserts and cakes that they make in-house; yup, tiramisu was spotted amongst a fruit cream cake, coffee buttercream cake, green tea crepe-like cake, and a few others. (The only dessert not prepared in-house was their New York Cheesecake.)  The prices are great! $4.55 for a large size (24 oz.)

I would say the only thing I dislike about the place, is the location. It was really hard for me to find on the GPS and it was hidden way back behind the complex, I also don't believe that you could see the sign very well either, other than that downfall.. it is really a hidden gem. This place is right next to a new Pho restaurant that just opened up! If that helps anyone!   When I walked in with my friend, it was a cute little shop. It felt cozy and welcoming. The different tables and chairs made me at home. The people there are friendly and give you when you walk in and if you have any questions about the menu, they will gladly answer it! After looking this place up and reading some other yelp reviews, I decided on the honey toast and the crepe cake. I honestly couldn't decide between the two, so I got both! Haha. We ordered the food and decided to sit outside. They have two tables in the corner overlooking some apartment complexes, the view was okay. Nothing special, we just enjoyed the weather!   They brought the desserts outside to us and they were presented so sweetly! They looked so appealing on the plate, you didn't want to touch the work of art! The crepe cake came with some raspberry sauce and orange slices, I like the fact that you can pour as little or as much raspberry sauce on your crepe cake. It wasn't too sweet and the texture was almost melt in your mouth. It was good! My friend ordered the green tea crepe, and he enjoyed it just as much as well. The honey toast came out a little later than the crepe cakes, but that was okay because when it came out it was warm and smelled heavenly. It was worth the wait. I love how sweet it was, it was the perfect combination of toast and honey. I added strawberries to mine, so the strawberries balanced the sweetness of the honey. I didn't add any ice cream because I thought it would be a little too much. So getting the honey toast with the strawberries was perfect for me! Writing this is making my mouth water!

We get our hello kitty cake and creme brulee relatively quickly and our drinks took a little longer than expected. They do not offer boba on the menu which was surprising to me.

Because I am a matcha fanatic, I decided to get the matcha crepe cake with green tea ice cream and an iced green tea latte. My boyfriend got honey toast with condensed milk, strawberries and strawberry ice cream and an iced taro tea latte. The drinks took a few minutes. My green tea latte was amazing, but the taro tea was a little powdery, but still good. Not too sweet. The crepe cake came out next. It was beautiful, and my boyfriend and I spent quite a few minutes taking pictures of it and a video of me pouring on the matcha sauce over it. The cake itself was delicious! It was sweet enough to satisfy my sweet tooth, but wasn't an overload of sweetness. The green tea ice cream they used was my favorite part about it though...I wonder what brand of ice cream it was? Whatever it was, it was one of the best green tea ice creams I've ever had. Just as we were finishing my crepe cake, my boyfriends honey toast came out. It was beautiful as well, and the guy working also gave us a side cup of condensed milk in case we wanted extra. It was amazing. The toast was perfectly warm and crispy on the edges.

What I love the most about this place is the atmosphere of this establishment and the decor matches up with the display of the desserts (both super cute!).  The second time we went, we got the honey toast with matcha ice cream and whipped cream on top with peanut butter. It wasn't all that, still preferred the banoffee cake the most! This time I tried their lychee iced tea and it was super delicious & refreshing!  The last time we went, we took one of our friends with us and she was super impressed with how the cafe looked and was surprised the items on the menu tasted delicious. We got a coffee crumble cake (we were curious, but after taking a bite out of it... it wasn't delicious at all... we ended up throwing it away..), coconut cream cake, and the tiramisu (SO BOMBS!). For drinks, we ordered the Sesame Milk Tea, Pistachio Latte and  Lychee Iced Tea.

YES.  IS SWEET is in the back of an already unknown plaza on Spring Mountain. The restaurant is small and filled with mismatched couches and tables. You can either say it has an antique feel to it or say it looks worn down. Your choice.  The crepe cakes are not on the main board menu (small board off to the side - $4.50). The matcha crepe cake (or mirufiiyu in Japan) has the true bitter matcha taste. None of that over sweetened stuff from Starbucks they call matcha! The honey toast has a cheap initial price of $4.50 but it adds up once you start adding your toppings. Strawberry icecream and bananas are my favorite combo. Nutella is too strong of a flavor and kills the buttery taste of the toast. Leave the nutella for something else!  The ice coffee was decent. Everything is served in a mason jar.

Wow, those 2 drinks were pretty filling, but I figured I'm not in Chinatown that often, better go for the signature honey toast. I make honey toast at home myself, but it's actually just a piece of toasted bread with country crock and honey on top. So imagine that, gourmeted and freshened up. Yum. The  toast  is very thick and kinda airy - more like a waffle than bread, I would say. They offer a huge selection of toppings, so we went with the cashier's recommendation of nutella, vanilla ice cream, and fruit (blueberries). It was good, but sooo sweet and over the top, after we just had a couple sweet drinks. If I were to go again, I might just get a plain honey toast or sample one of the other kinds of desserts they had in the display case.

It's retarded how much I've been here. It's always my go to spot after dinner or just to take someone for some coffee and desserts. I've been on a few dates here too, and brought family just to enjoy. Hell, last night I bumped into a friend there who mentioned that she only went to IS SWEET because I recommended it and always take great Snapchats. lmao.   I just need to remember to always check in on yelp. I tend to forget because I go straight to the dessert and stare insanely at them.   I've tried most, if not, all of their desserts. The tiramisu, the Hello Kitty strawberry cake, crème brule, bannofie pie, cheesecake, cute little bear face nutella mouse, the chocolate cake, and of course, their crepe cakes. I've also tried their waffle and their honey toast.   Drink wise, I've had their caramel frappe, taro milk tea, mocha latte, and a couple others.   I have not been disappointed!  It's a very comfortable ambience. Rustic, yet trendy. The music is always mellow or some sort of acoustic covers of top charted songs. It has plenty of seats, but it does get busy. A lot of people like the place and the brick wall look is where people always try to sit at. Great background for your picture taking needs! The lighting is somewhat dimmed, but still a lot of lighting at night. During the day, the sunlight hugs the place nicely.    The presentation of the desserts and drinks are adorable to where you HAVE to take a pictures! So bring your camera's or have juice on your phone to take a ton of pics. Its funny, even though I've taken a bunch of pics of the desserts I've had, if I get the same dessert again, I still take pics! lol.  Anyway, when Game (co-owner) is working and see's me, he already knows what I want.  HEY!! Tiramisu?  HAHAHAH! Love him! Every time I see someone walk in, I see him always smiling and welcoming anyone and everyone. Princess too! There's always great attitude in there!

It's in the plaza right before the jade/ramen area.  You'll pass by a few law firms and an acupuncture clinic before you find it nestled as the very last building.   Until 04/30th there is a promotion going on for buy one get one 50% or 30% with a yelp or facebook check in.  Setting: Very cute and they did a good job at going for the coffee shop fad that is going on now. The music playing is your typical bon iver type radio station that isn't on too loud like it is at serenade or cafe darak. There are plenty of places to sit which accommodate mostly couples but there is a large that fits six.  Another highlight of this place is the amount of outlets available. This store definitely took the effort to install outlets to help techies like me stay charged.  Service: The female manager was very kind and delivered a convincing story to her coffee shop. Basically,  We don't serve drinks that we don't like,  which makes total sense.  Why conform when you should create a product you yourself would want to buy?  Drink: I got the hazelnut frappe which could have been blended better but it was still good.  Overall: A great place nestled far enough from the roads of spring mountain while on spring mountain.

This place is probably the best dessert cafe in Vegas that's cute, decently priced, and extremely delicious. When my boyfriend and I first found this cafe, I kid you not, we came here every single day for a whole week. We've tried all of the teas and most desserts. Gam, the barista, knows our names. He is super kind and friendly, as well as the other employees! Though we don't come everyday, you can still catch is here at least once a week.   Location and decoration: This cafe is quite hidden and is easily missed, but the great part is there's plenty of parking. It's in the very corner of the Plaza, and the entrance is next to the covered parking spots. The inside of the cafe is adorable. Vintage, mismatched furniture and dreamy music gives off that indie, coffee shop vibe where you come to read a book on a rainy day. I just love it in here. Plus, they have free WiFi so you can do homework.  My personal favorite drink is either the black sesame milk tea or the Thai lemon tea. Must try!! For desserts, I would recommend the matcha mille crepe, creme brûlée, or create your own waffle. The desserts aren't overly sweet, just the perfect amount of sweetness!

However, the third time's the charm.  I met up with a couple of gal pals who've never been and we shared several items on the menu:  honey toast, matcha crepe cake, taro latte, matcha latte, and a caramel iced latte.  The honey toast that we ordered had mango, strawberry, kiwi, and a scoop of strawberry ice cream and it was the BOMB!  Seriously.  I've had honey toast at a few other places around town and this version is probably in my top two, it was that good.  I also liked the taro latte the best of the three drinks.  The matcha crepe cake is one item that is Instagrammed very often from this spot and there's no doubt that it's lovely to see.  However, the taste doesn't match its looks.  It's not terrible, but it's just ok to me. I know that matcha is not normally too sweet to begin with, but this cake needed a bit more flavor for my taste.  It could also be that the excellence of the honey toast overshadowed the crepe cake, so give it a whirl if you are a matcha lover.

I lured my parents to check it out too by saying.. we have to walk this pho out and walked right into IS SWEET ;)   Hiding at the corner, this place is at the very end of the business complex. Mind you, do Not park under the covered parking structure. Or you'll get your car towed! I feel the businesses around this area has picked up exceedingly well from having Viet Noodle Bar open at this location. It works in both favors.. eat some delicious Vietnamese cuisine and then walk a few stores down.. Bam. You got yourself a place for after dinner non-alcoholic drinks and at the same time.. satisfy your sweet tooth ;) The best of both worlds for foodie lovers!!!  I, somewhat lost interest in trying this place, since a coworker told me it was just O-K. Damn I should've just went and tried it myself before dismissing it as the atmosphere is oh so cozy and nice! It was so wonderful. I was admiring the festive decoration they've done for Halloween ;) That's the spirit! I like that about local businesses that are open to do those things that make it fun and welcoming to the guests. It made me smile looking around.. those hanging skulls, bats upside down, skeletons on the windows, spider webs, and mummified skeleton got me in the mood to spook someone.. maybe with my silly laugh that my brother says is something else :P Hehe, keke, haha, hoho.. wait that's for Christmas!  The kind lady that helped me was patient and kind with answering all my questions on what's good here. I looked up and Thai Lemon Tea caught my eyes. My mom was eyeing the creme brulee, so we got those to try. You know when you drink or eat something and that flavor hits you on the first sip or bite and you have this animated cartoon look where your eyes become hearts popping out?! Yeah... my Mom and I had that moment. That Thai Lemon Tea got me. Grabbed my heart and ran kind of feeling. Remarkably refreshing. The hints of sweetness from the Thai Tea followed with sourness of the acidity from the lemon. It's like your favorite candy.. This would be for all the Sour Patch Kids Lovers.. but as a drink! I can seriously become an addict of this one. I slurped this up in F1 racing speed and I was instantly yearning for more. I'm even thinking about it right now as I write this review! Someone save me!!! Heroes! Batman, Superman, Voltron, Optimus Prime!!!??! Help me.. I need this driiiiiink! *with my hands reaching the sky.....Is anyone there?!  Creme Brulee.. one word.. LOVE. Strikingly gratifying. That custard-like creme that just melts on your tongue. Oh... . I'm lost for words. Give me a moment.... ....... ........................... ......... . Not overpoweringly sweet nor lacking of it. It's just a masterpiece. You can't go wrong with this dessert. No way, no how. There's some magic in this. I swear I took one bite and I was in happy land paradise. The sun was shining and a rainbow of color lit my palate. Let me tell you how good this dessert was... I can close my eyes and sleep with a smile :) Get some.  I'm going to stop by after work more often to this place when I just need that dessert fix I can't get from anywhere else. And to be open seven days of week til the strike of midnight?! I heart this place to the moon and back and back again I go!!!

It's open fairly late, which was a major selling point for us.   One friend had been here already, and suggested the honey toast...since I was a honey toast virgin, I trusted her recommendation and she did not steer me wrong. I asked the guy took our order how he liked his honey toast, and he suggested vanilla ice cream, strawberries, banana, and condensed milk...okay, why not?   My friends ordered different flavors of crepe cake--the matcha, the vanilla, and the red velvet. We created a nice little tasting table for ourselves.   I was very happy with the honey toast - the fruit was the perfect addition, with little bursts of tart strawberry. I wasn't as big of fan of the crepe cakes as I thought I would be, the vanilla was my favorite though. My honey toast was the clear winner, as the four of us demolished it.

I came in about 545 on a Tuesday and it was literally just me and my friend. Love when that happens! My friend had arrived before I did and she handed me a menu to stare at. I stared, but i wasn't really staring a. Has that happen to you? Just me? Impossible. I continued to stare at this menu and pretended like i was thoroughly reading, i mean i wanted to  read  it but the brain wasnt processing. Lol.   So I get up to order with no idea as to what was I going to have. At the register was a nice cashier who offered me what they are most popular for after me asking...she says the crepe cakes and suggested the matcha crepe cake. Looked at her and told her, okay yep...that's what I'll have then. Thennn...I notice the big ole board behind with drinks they have to offer. Again, my eyes were looking but home girls weren't processing  My eyes noticed the words latte, and Thai tea. Boring me and the lazy me said, let me get the Thai tea.   I finally had an awakening from whatever cloud my head was in (probably from all the slow downs on the 15 just trying to get here) and notice Thai lemon tea. If you don't know, love me some iced tea. Told the cashier okay just joking, let me get that Thai lemon tea. I am sooo glad I did!   My matcha crepe cake was deliciously moist and IS SWEET. It comes with a matcha green tea syrup that you jizz all over and makes it even more fantasticly  deelish with a piece of blueberry and strawberry to match. The Thai lemon tea literally tastes like Thai tea but minus the creamer with a lemon as a garnish. It was good. Like so good I went into tea time days later damn near asking if they can make such a thing for me.  We spent 4 hours chatting and chatting and discovered that once the sun dims down, the place really picks up of folks grouping together and chatting over dessert. And the traffic didn't seem to die down and it was nearly 10 at night...on a Tuesday!  Honestly, I didn't finish my crepe cake completely because the buggah IS SWEET after awhile. If you have a sweet tooth or tis one of those days when the glucose needs some refilling...this is a cute spot to check out. I wouldn't see myself coming here as a regular just because I can only handle so much sweetness in a day let alone a week. However, I certainly would stop in when I'm in the vicinity for the Thai lemon tea or if a friend wanted to meet up. Which something tells me I'll end up here a few more times in a month than I can admit. Lol.  Definitely a better choice than your typical let's meet at Starbucks kind of date.  I sampled my friends honey brick toast and that was yummmmy! Perfectly toasted I must add. They have all kinds of toppings and some ice cream selections to add to your toast.  So if you are on spring mountain after eating at some pho, ramen, bbq, crawfish, etc...joint and is looking for something sweet. This may just be what you are seeking.   Definitely recommend!

Is Sweet is a hidden shop that is in the same plaza as Viet Noodle Bar, but you'll probably not see it because it's all the way at the end where no one really wanders. If you're lucky enough to find this gem, congratulations.   My first visit here was interesting since me and my friends weren't too sure as to what we were getting into. The menu was simple as they heavily specialize in coffee and tea. If you want desserts along with that, they have a rather small section of crepe cakes, honey toasts, cheesecakes and more. I believe that their inventory of desserts heavily depends on the supply.   We tried the honey toast and red velvet crepe cake along with a dark chocolate frap. The honey toast was up to par. I'm not sure you can get any better than that. They don't normally put a lot of honey on top of the toast, but feel free to douse it yourself. The salt from the butter compliments the sweetness of honey and ice cream all together that you're getting all these distinguishing flavors that work harmoniously together. It's pretty damn amazing.   Red velvet crepe cake was less than impressive. Nothing about this particular plate tasted close to red velvet that I almost thought it was an insult to label it that. Just because it's colored red doesn't make it a red velvet anything. It almost tasted like a sponge cake with subtle hints of sweetness to it. Honestly, I'm not a fan. The texture and flavor were just not there.   The drink was up to par. It tasted like chocolate with the right balance of ingredients to them. Still, there was nothing special about it that would make me want to return for that particular drink. I was going to order milk tea here, but I was told that they don't have boba which is a shame because I can't imagine drinking milk tea without boba. That was just very puzzling.  Service was nothing special. Their rep was patient enough to put up with my indecisiveness but was slow when it came to making our order. The second time I stopped by here was wayyyyy too long, and I definitely did not appreciate that because that was a quick stop for dessert.   I would love to have given this place a four star, but there are some things that they need to work on such as bringing more desserts into the menu, and adding boba.

Well, seating in the cafe is quite fashionable, but not to my liking regarding comfortability. I find the seats to be all oddly spaced out, but no big deal. The point of being there is for the dessert. Now, onto customer service. The cashiers are always usually nice and smile as you decide on your order, and never fail to giggle if you express your excitement towards satisfying your sweet tooth. Overall, I love this place!", "Date": "2016-10-18", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jennifer", "ReviewID": "xdhDExxlJ_7A1dy-THIojA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I like the place! Great decor and chill. Their desserts are amazing but slightly pricey for just a slice of cake in my book. But besides that, it's very delicious and I definitely recommend coming here.", "Date": "2016-06-05", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Eric", "ReviewID": "-fkUmPUSELAjSi4YTleWpQ", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Man this place sucked.  Lets start with their location.  It's in the corner of this small plaza where you can't see anything.  Second thing is price. This place is a joke for the price it is charging for their drinks and cakes.  Last thing food. We wanted to try another desert spot in Vegas after Sweet Raku. We came here to try their layered cake and strawberry cake. They didn't have the strawberry cake because they don't have enough business to sell everything on the menu. The gent taking my order said some days we have some days we don't. The cake had no flavor, it was a just ehh. Also ordered a kiwi slush and a mango smoothie. Basically had a sip of the mango smoothie and left it because it tasted like crap. The milk didn't even blend with the mango concentrate and ice. Nasty. Won't return.", "Date": "2016-11-22", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Iting", "ReviewID": "-NZ-UntzQmlEMElZSYcO6w", "Overall": "5", "Content": "very nice dining environment and friendly services.

Honey toast are yummy with the vanilla ice cream and fresh strawberries. The cake are homemade and serve with cute decorations. They beverage are nice but a bit too sweet, I will need to tell them to lower on the sweetness.

My life long dream has been to try honey toast and the wonderful Stefany  made my dream come true on that sad sad day .    I was not disappointed folks.  I am in love with Honey toast . It's warm and soft with Ice cream . Full of beautiful unhealthy calories but it was exactly what I needed after losing my dear old friend .   We also tried the green tea crepe cake . It was different . It's light and it wasn't as sweet as I had hoped .   The decor is cute and everyone working there was very nice :)", "Date": "2016-11-02", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
