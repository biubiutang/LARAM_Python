The customer service on the other hand is horrendous. They're ALWAYS out of menu items and I had to repeat my order THREE DAMN TIMES to the guy that took it.

I would come in from school and he'd be at the table eating, reading his new paper, and there in the chair next to him, our family cat, waiting patiently for a nibble.    So today while out and about town, my husband had a great idea, let's try Church's. The Louisiana chicken place by the house had closed for some time now, so it made sense to try it again.  Crunchy, juicy, hot out of the fryer, this chicken is delicious. I had a side of fried okra and enjoyed my meal.  I haven't had Church's in such a long time, I had forgotten how it tasted.", "Date": "2012-03-22", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Beau", "ReviewID": "3X17_36s5Vnm8SDtwKavSg", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Stopped here a few days ago for lunch.  I was a car behind the one ordering at the speaker in the drive-thru with 2 more ahead of them. 5 minutes later the front car finally pulls out and I go up to order. I couldn't understand the employee and she could not understand me so I had to pretty much wait till I got to the window to order which is when she told me what I wanted would take about 10 minutes to come out. I noticed the car that was at the front of the line still sitting off to the side waiting so I decided against it. I can't comment on the good, but the drive thru service was painfully slow/non-existent. They also don't have much of a value meal menu and some of their meal prices are pretty high. I wouldn't recommend stopping by.", "Date": "2011-09-13", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Nikki", "ReviewID": "UqR588IqOkr-37g2cueixw", "Overall": "1", "Content": "This, food was fresh however we order spicy and I called to tell them of the mistake and Ale the manager would care less of his mistake.

Obviously their food is good that is the ONLY reason I go back. It is obvious their concern for customer service is not there, no sense of apology for the inconvenience or anything.  I hope their upper management can help with their issue.

We love Church's, wish they had more here in the Valley.  I love the spicy, we get the huge wings only ( oh, there not called huge wings)  I have know idea, where they get chicken with wings like these.  I usually can't even eat both of them in the 2 piece meal. Yes, they will charge you a little more for 2 wings or all wings, WHAT EVER!

We thought we would try a new highly advertised Smokehouse Chicken. Went to drive through and ordered two orders and some mashed potatoes.  Tiffany said it would be 16 minutes since they only had one on hand. This was at 5:30 dinner time. So I said OK, I'll wait.  When the bag was given to me, I took off.  When I got home, I found that the potatoes weren't there so I called and notified the store. She said that they knew they messed up and took my name and asked me to come back. Today, only three days later, I returned. I was greeted by Luis Corona. I explained the situation. With a crappy attitude, he said  what's your claim number .    I didn't get one , I said.   Did you call? , he asked  Yes, and she took my name  He made me wait while he waited on two customers and tried to call the girl who fouled up the order. All this for $3.69.  I told him that he was making this harder than he had to. After a stare down that lasted 15 seconds, he opened the register and gave me four bucks with a comment of  There, I couldn't get through to her to confirm your story. I told him that  I felt so blessed by his generosity  and left never to return.", "Date": "2016-07-09", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Damon", "ReviewID": "N3QIpoXtvh-s5wDMNsvaqA", "Overall": "1", "Content": "This place is poorly run and understaffed. 15 minutes minimum for them fill a simple order for a 3 piece. Completely inept and rude employees. The definition of  fast food  is nowhere near what this restaurant represents. Kitchen and lobby consistently filthy with condiments under stocked in the lobby as well. Seriously it should not be this difficult to order and receive food. Wish there was more than in the area, because although I enjoy  the chicken, this particular restaurant and staff leave a lot to be desired.

Look at this pic! Definitely NOT just smashed. That's a perfect circle... A BITE MARK! We ordered through the drive-thru.. Went home and found this. The manager wanted me to drive all the way back to get the $1.79 or whatever the less than $2 for this corn was - which you know in Vegas, nothing is just 2 minutes away! He didn't offer anything but that! Says you don't have to come back right now but whenever you can so I can give you the $1 something. Wtf?! I said why would I drive back just for that? And he says well that's all he can do. He can't return the payment to the card we used.. He can't refund everything. Doesn't offer something to cover how they grossed us out and inconvenienced us! How about not giving me nasty used food! And refund my whole purchase! Ridiculous! Doesn't care about the customer! Isn't even embarrassed they served that! No integrity! I even wrote to corporate and NO REPLY!

Both had pretty good food, and I really like that I could get fried okra at Church's, but I still have to only give it two stars based on the experience.   Church's was dirty, the building looked ancient, and it seemed like nothing was upgraded since it opened. There were flies, the door was messed up, and although I didn't notice my husband pointed out that the air conditioning was flawed. That was not the worst problem though. Now before anyone calls me a racist, I have no problem with people who can claim that English is their second language. I do have a problem with someone who can barely speak English, and the English they do speak is impossible to understand. She seemed like a perfectly nice person, but she should be working as a food preparer instead of taking orders.   I feel the lack of customer service and the ambiance really took away from the experience, and it was not surprising that while Popeye's was doing a rather large lunch business, Church's was empty except for one other customer.", "Date": "2013-09-09", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Nelson", "ReviewID": "9qqQYQIrXpsPIB7TOgz-KQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(328/365)  Finger Lickin' Fried Chicken   Yes, its a chain, but hey, I'm a Fan....Don't Judge! On our way to church, we wanted something fast and quick, so we thought Church's would do the trick. We step inside and there's a wait time like you couldn't imagine!  People were ordering by the 50 and 70 pieces, and we were only looking to try this for the first time! People were waiting for their order inside and in the drive thru too! as we stood in line, we could see the ladies dredging chicken in the seasoned flour trying to keep up with the demand. When it came time for us to order. We were told that it was gonna be about a 15-20 minutes for a fresh batch. Nooooooooo!!!!  We were pressed for time and thank goodness while we were contemplating our decision a worker pulls out a hot tray of biscuits and glazes them with honey, and about 30 seconds later, a fresh batch of fried chicken arrives!  Legs and thighs okay?  the lady asks... Perfect!  we reply, so we both get a two piece meal with some sweet tea and we were set...Crunchy, Juicy, and more finger lickin' good than the colonel's secret recipe, we enjoyed every single bite huffing and puffing from all of that hot, steamy, juicy goodness! The biscuits are some of the softest and tastiest you'll ever sink your teeth into, but the mashed potatoes are instant, so nothing special about those...  Prices are very reasonable, and the taste will definitely bring me back the next time a craving hits!  ALOHA!!!
