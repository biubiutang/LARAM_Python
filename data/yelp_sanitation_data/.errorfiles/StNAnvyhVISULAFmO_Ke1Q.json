The burgers were to.die.for! Big fat yummy, tender, juicy, seasoned ground beef, just like dad used to bbq. Today, I got a tough, tasteless, cardboard replica of a Sams club or Costco bulk frozen patty. Since when does 100% ground beef have 90 degree hard edges? The bun was soaked in grease, and it was essentially a crunchy chewy greasy blob of gunk. The saving grace were the fries and beautifully blended Coke. (Note: your $7.99 burger only comes as a burger - no fries, salad or even a pickle. Your fries are gonna set you back another three bucks on any dog, sandwich or entree.) I'm so sad. When I was craving an old fashioned thick, juicy, tasty burger on a toasted warm bun, I'd run to Great Links.

Always, was curious and a friend, said it was good. So what the hell. First and foremost, the menu is extensive. Every type of hot dog, made every way possible, with every topping you could ever imagine. Not only that, but they had burgers as well and sandwiches. They had you're mushroom burger, patty melts, and some creative burgers with ingredients I have never seen mixed together. Very original. I had the Pastrami Melt. Good old pastrami, grilled onions, mustard and swill on grilled rye. It was dead on, geat sandwich, very filling. For 5.99$ I was very satisfied. I had some of the italian fries. Those were good, I wish they put a little bit more of the garlic butter, and a little less parmesan cheese. That might just be me though, whenever butter is part of the equation, you better use a lot of it, or not at all. Go big or go home. I had a bite of the patty melt, my friend had. very delicious.

This place was definitely a compromise with a great reward!   They will substitute any menu item that has meat in it with the vegetarian option of it (veggie chicken patty, burger patty, bacon, and chili)...they can also substitute turkey too.  The food the rest of the family had was enjoyed just as much...will definitely be back! Staff was great and place was clean.  The only thing I would recommend is that if your at a table where there is veggie and non-veggie orders being placed - order the veggie item first as there was a gap of about 10 minutes between the food coming out. (they do indicate on their menu that veggie items take a few minutes longer).", "Date": "2014-08-10", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jason", "ReviewID": "52gJGyXJA4gNngvkj1ufQQ", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Perhaps my trip this restaurant was just a stray from the norm, or perhaps the people that review this place have never been to a quality burger and dog type place.   I gave this restaurant a fair shot and was excited based on Yelp reviews. Yelp rarely fails me but this was one of those times where it fell short of expectations.   Is there a good-ole-boy system at this place? All I heard the owner talking about was their award winning burgers to whom I supposed are the regulars. My wife, daughter and I were the only people under the age of 50 there, so perhaps that explains why their food was so bland and flavorless.   I ordered the pastrami, which was cooked really well. However, there was little taste. I have tried pastrami from dozens of restaurants and this was bottom-of-the-barrell in terms of taste.   My wife ordered grilled cheese, which is impossible to screw up unless you're 4 years old or completely inept. It was solid, but she ordered it with bacon and bacon saves everything. The bread was alright, but seemed store-bought.   My daughter ordered chicken nuggets and she said they were disgusting. I looked at them and they appeared to be the type you buy from a frozen food section.   We shared fries, which apparently do not come with any sort of salt or seasoning.   To be fair, the waitresses there were super friendly and on top of their game. I hope the owner realizes this and recognizes them accordingly.   What I found off-putting on a personal level was that the owner came out and greeted every single table, asked about their experience and bragged about their food.... except for our table. He also missed a kid run into the restaurant, grab two soda cups, fill them and leave without paying. All because he was too busy bragging about his food to the NASCAR crowd that was infesting this place.   One of the cooks also took the time to venture into the diner and talk about the burger competition they had previously won. he oddly went out of his way to state that  I don't think they'll want us back next year. Not that we're cheating but...  and I didn't catch the end.   Overall, I was pretty disappointed with this place considering the positive reviews on yelp. I will eventually give this place another chance to redeem itself and, if it isn't able to, I'll suspect that they are asking friends and family to circumvent the yelp reviews.   Either that or they rarely get anyone who isn't an AARP member and can actually handle salt and seasoning.", "Date": "2013-07-09", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Carol", "ReviewID": "IGH3nBZ0MOaen-t48pDyGQ", "Overall": "3", "Content": "As a kid growing up in home were mom didn't work, we rarely ate hot dogs. She always cook for us. When we did picnic's at the lake, or camping which we did a lot in the summer months, we'd eat hot dogs roasted over an open flame. Chili cheese dogs came later, and I didn't get to experience gourmet dogs until my adult years.   Today we tried Great Links, and I was surprised at the different variations of hot dogs. If you want new experience try this place. I had the  Chicago dog with fried zucchini sticks. My husband ordered the chili cheese fries with the New York hot dog.   The bun became soggy with the liquid from the relish? And when I went to pick mine up, it kinda fell apart in my hand, and with each bite, the toppings fell off and the hot dog came through the bottom of the bun. We watched the guy make them, so we know they were not sitting for a while, but still yet, who likes a soggy bun?   The flavors of the peppers, pickle, tomato, onions, and green relish worked well together, the hot dog itself had a little snap to it, so I assume it was close to the real thing, however, I would try a different dog next time. As for the sides, the zucchini sticks were plentiful and had good crisp to them, but the chili on the fries did seem canned.   For a hot dog, this place was just okay. I'd try it again, just because of the variety on the menu.

So maybe my experience was based off good expectations. However, I ordered the southern hot dog and my wife got the Chicago dog. I also got home-style fries and she got the mozzarella sticks.   The hot dogs were alright and tasted pretty good, nothing amazing and I found them comparable to Sonic's hot dogs.  The mozzarella sticks probably came straight from the freezer from Costco or the like and were nothing original.  The home-style french fries were disgusting. I think they let the potatoes set out too-long, because the fries tasted bad, were very soggy, and lacked any taste other than oil. I do not know how it is possible to have a burned soggy fry.  The service was horrible. The owner was there when we went and it was not busy at all, but we had to wait 15 minutes to order even though our waitress was sitting directly in-front of us watching Sponge-bob Square-pants. We were clearly ready to order for at least five minutes before because we decided to fold our menus up to make it even more obvious that we were ready to go. When we left, we went through a similar situation, not sure if we should just walk up to the cash register at the front or wait for somebody to come to our table.

I ordered the ball park dog, which has mustard, ketchup, relish and onions.. sounds good-hmm, and beer battered onion rings with a diet pop.  My husband ordered a kielbasa sausage, Italian fries and a diet pop.  Lets start off with the chopped onion on my hotdog!  the onion was chopped in quite large pieces and there were WAY TOO MANY PEICES ON ONE HOTDOG!! It tasted like they used the relish that has the cloves in it, so I didn't care for the relish on there, and they put soooo much mustard on it and barely any ketchup at all.. all in all, I was very disappointed with my hotdog.  The onion rings were quite tasty, light and crispy, just the way I like them.  My husbands purchase, well it came on a bun with the sausage cut into four small pieces, he took one out and it is the way they cooked it! so it kept falling apart on him, they didn't drain the sauerkraut that was put onto it so the bun got very soggy.. I don't know if anyone else likes sauerkraut juice dripping from your bun, but he sure didn't.  His Italian fries came with some kind of Italian seasoning and parm. cheese and olive oil. They put so much olive oil on his fries that when he was done eating them, there had to be at least a half a cup of oil in the bottom of his dish, they put way too much oil on them... he was very disappointed with both the sausage and the fries that he ordered... when we first got there he asked them to turn the tv down, we were really close to it, and they turned it down one... they have two tvs in there and my husband and I were the only customers in there at the time he asked them to turn it down, so that just wasn't right of them... when we first walked in and the waitress came and took our order I noticed she had gloves on, I was thinking that was good.. If I had realized that they don't change their gloves in between orders.. (they didn't that day while we were there) we would have asked them to change them. The guy that was working was walking around running his hands along the counters and knocking on the counters and touching it seemed everything then he didn't change his gloves when other people came in there... she didn't either.

But for Great Links, I'll make the exception.  When I was 17, I was having the time of my life running around Philly and Brooklyn.  I was on an extended vacation (months) visiting my relatives and was bouncing between the two cities. It was my first east coast experience, and it was incredible. What I remember the most was not the sights and the sounds, but it was the food. OMG the food...how I miss it.  Great Links is able to bring me a little slice of what I remember and loved most about Brooklyn and Philly. Another reviewer said it best: The moment you step inside the doors, you don't feel like you're in Vegas anymore. Suddenly you're in a casual, intimate little retro diner where you can place your order at the front, or grab a barstool at the counter and watch the cooks prepare your food. Heck, you're so close you could even chat with them - but I try not to, because they're busy cooking 20 things at once. For the east coast, these types of joints litter every street corner. For Vegas, it's not so common. It makes it all the more special.  Everyone there is really nice. The cooks/grillmasters are awesome and very talented - I can't seem to cook more than one thing at a time without burning it all on MY stove, so how they manage to do it so well is beyond me. They chat to the customers when they can, and make sure that you're doing ok. The servers are also friendly and attentive. I've even met the owner, and he's a very personable guy. And he works hard too, because I've watched him bus tables when it gets really busy. I've never seen a owner do dirty work at any other restaurant, so he has my respect.  The menu is extensive and delicious.The portions are huge and extremely affordable. They have more than hot dogs for those not in the mood, as well as salads for those of you that are a little more health-conscious (I am not one of those people). They have a breakfast menu that I'd like to try someday - if I can ever convince myself to wake up before noon on my days off.  In addition to the food, they have the usual soft drinks, milk shakes, malt beverages, bottled beer, and even some beer on tap. Never have tried a milkshake, because I usually get filled up on my entree, but they look good, and I am tempted.  During lunch rush hour, expect to wait a little bit longer for your food. This is not a slam against the restaurant - everything is prepared fresh, and it gets seriously busy. I don't mind waiting the extra few minutes for good food. I believe you can call ahead and place a to-go order - so if you're short on time and not dining in, this might be a better way to go.  I can't say enough good things. I am a happy customer, and I'm pretty picky about where I spend my money. I appreciate a place that serves good food and brings back happy memories of a long-time-ago.", "Date": "2011-07-02", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Krystal", "ReviewID": "_MkzZbyYD2xtJJV-eMLeTQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I really, really, really wanted a hotdog, after googling a few local places, my hunny brought me here. The selection was awesome and since everything is a la carte, you aren't locked into a combo meal you don't really want. We shared a small shoestring fry and each got two dogs, a plain and a specialty.   The hotdogs themselves are great, they pop in your mouth, are juicy and full of flavor. I chose the deluxe chili dog which is basically a standard chili dog plus bacon, onion, jalapeños and a literal fistful of shredded cheese. I'm super picky about chili, can't stand it if it's soupy or greasy or overly spicy for no reason. I wasn't disappointed, everything about it was delicous. My hunny picked the Las Vegas chili dog, and I can honestly say, it was basically a flavor explosion on a bun.   My order was misread and delivered wrong at first, but the cook not only insisted on fixing it, did so in record time. The server was nothing but helpful, the overall service was great.  If the order had come out correctly the first time, this would be a solid five star review, as it is, I'd honestly say it's more of a 4.5 than a 4. If want a hotdog but wanna have it be better than pretty much anything you could make at home for a reasonable price, this is your place.

Then I saw the bratwurst and my mind was made up. Same for my husband. In fact, we decided to order two of the #3 (brat, drink, and fries). I ordered my brat with K-up, mustard, cheese, and onions (Yum!); the fries the crinklely ones and my husband ordered his with the spicy mustard only; the fries traditional.  We were not disappointed with our food at all. In fact, we both wanted another despite already been stuffed. A couple for the road maybe? As others have mentioned in their reviews, these dogs do have a  snap  to them when you take that first bite. It's the way a dog or a brat should be. All dogs and fries are made fresh when ordered, which you can tell. The refills on your drinks are free and automatically served in those take-out cups so you can fill up before heading out the door.

Not only do they make amazing assed hot dogs, they also have something called a pastrami cheeseburger (I CAN HAS?). Their menu is extensive and goes anywhere from a plain hot dog to full on Chicago dogs and Caesar salads.  For such a small place they had quite the selection of beers (by the bottle), too.      I went with the Chicago dog and was excited to see they use the bright green relish. I have never been to Chicago, but I feel even the most extreme purist would delight in this party in your mouth. The wiener (hehe) was crisp with every bite and the toppings were fresh! The service felt familiar and could be confused with anywhere but Vegas. I haven't even gotten to the best part... The Cottage fries. Made fresh with each order, they are fried to perfection and lightly seasoned with sea salt. No ketchup needed. I will go back just for these.

The reason I'm giving it 3 stars because I cook behind the counter never changed his gloves and was wiping his face with sweat the whole time. Luckily the meal tasted good.

Tonight my daughter and I came back for a fun dinner on a girls night... They were very busy and only a few tables inside empty (they also have outdoor seating and a nice diner style bar)  Ashley was our server and their were two cooks, I thought when we walked in we may be waiting a while. Boy was I wrong. We had our drinks in no time, placed our order and enjoyed the Razorback game on one TV and The Cubbies on the other.  Our food was hot and fresh. As soon as our food came out of the fryer it was at our table and oh it was Wonderful!! Fried mushrooms in their beer batter was just the way to start. You must try the cottage fries which are really homemade chips!!  Being from the Chicago land area, I know a good Chicago dog and this was over the top. My daughter had the fish and chips and absolutely loved it!  Ashley had her hands full with all her tables, but you would have never known. She made it look like a breeze and we never felt neglected! She has a great personality and seems like she really enjoys her job! Both the cooks were nice and doing an amazing job getting food out dast, fresh and yummy!! One of the cooks even brought my daughter over a cookie when we were getting ready to leave, which really made her night. On our way out ashley told her to have a good week at school!

We ordered the Chicago and the Las Vegas hot dog with the natural Italian fries on the side. The fries came out first and unfortunately they were just ok. Too much parmesan cheese, too salty and too fatty and they got soggy very quick. The hot dogs were ok, almost too much of everything in my opinion.   Then, as soon as we walked out of this place, I ended up having an upset stomach that lasted all day. But this also could be due to me eating generally organic and healthy and perhaps my body doesn't like fatty food anymore. My husband was ok and he ate the same as I did, so I don't think the meat was bad.

There are very few places that you can go to here in Las Vegas where you actually feel like you're not in Las Vegas. And Great Links has the formula to make you feel like you're one of their own! The first time I had a Great Links signature hot dog, I tried the  Mob Boss  (pictured). I can't even come up with the words to describe how full of flavor (and calories) it is! Their hot dogs are tasty, the marinate sauce wasn't special, but was still good, the peppers are grilled, and the best part is the mozzarella sticks in it! YUM!  One of the treats that Great Links offers is their fresh raspberry iced tea! SO BOMB! it's taDAfor! The staff is really friendly and welcoming and the environment is really chill. If you go there, you'll see that this place has definitely made an impression on Yelp because of all the stickers all over the place. The time I came here was for a Laker game and the flat screens they have up sufficed for the entertainment and the cook (I forgot his name :x) is a HUGE Laker fan also! He made the dinner interesting with all the cheering and comments to the tv screen.  The setup of Great Links isn't like any other place here in Las Vegas and I'd have to say, aside from the great customer service, it would be the coolest part of this great Vegas spot! There aren't a lot of places set up this way so it makes it even more special! Their menu includes vegetarian dishes, beer brats cooked and marinated on the spot, a ton of different variances of their hot dog recipes! They also have sausages for the hot & spicy lovers out there. Their Italian fries are a basket OD garlic-y goodness! I highly recommend extra crisy shoestring fries! Perfect addition to any hot dog combination! I also tried their Vegas fries! This isn't for the light-hearted French fry lover; or even the heavy hearted (HIGH IN CALORIES, but good!) but if a friend orders them, grab a fork and grab a bite! Definitely worth a try!  I will have to come back to try the rest of their colorful palette of hot dogs and fries! Their great customer service bumps them up a star also!

We tried the Italian tater tots on our server's recommendation.  We were going to do fries, but her told us the tater tots would stand up better to all of the sauce, so we went with it.  Oh my goodness, those things were tasty!  The garlic goodness was great and the Parmesan on top sent it over the moon.

I saw it recently while driving around and thought  gee, I gotta get me some of that.   So come Saturday I was really craving a hot dog and off I went to be wrapped up in the menu like a hot dog in a bun.  It is a big menu for such a small place.  There are many different varieties of hot dogs as one might expect from a place called Great Links Hot Dogs.  But there is so much more.  There are also many types of sausage sandwiches to choose from as well.  Did I forget to mention they are famous for their burgers.  Yeah, they have won the Burger Wars burger competition two years running.  Then there are the many diffferent fried potato variations and combinations too.  Onion rings, jalapeno poppers, fried mushrooms.  The menu goes on and on.  I was so fascinated in all the offerings they have that I forgot all about my hot dog craving and went with a sausage sandwich instead.  It was a toss up between the Roasted Garlic and Mozzarela or the Spinach and Asiago Cheese.  The Spinach and Asiago is topped with mustard, mayo, tomato, pickles, relish and sport peppers not unlike a Chicago style hot dog.  It sounded damn good as a Chicago style dog is my favorite.  In the end it was the Roasted Garlic and Mushroom sausage that won my stomach and my heart.  A perfectly grilled chicken sausage stuffed with cheese and mushrooms then topped with grilled onion, bell peppers and mushrooms with the addition on marinara on top of that.  I also got an order of the stuffed jalapenos.  There were six in a basket and were served piping hot fresh out of the fryer.  The crisp coating was not oily despite being fried for about 4 minutes.  The molten cream cheese inside was nearly too much for my mouth to handle but the cooling richness of the ranch dip helped everything slide down.

The cheese is nice and melted. But I've also tried their Mob Boss Dog which has mozzarella sticks, peppers, onions, marinara, mushrooms and parmesan cheese.  It's a great hotdog when I'm not feeling so plain.  The main reason I like this place is their Italian fries. One of my favorite fries in Vegas. Each fry is loaded with Parmesan and Italian spices.

I was excited to see they offer veggie options and that is what I ordered: vegetarian chili and vegetarian hot dog plus a side salad. Most other items are fried, covered in cheese and sauces. I see this place as somewhere to stop by to watch the game, have a beer and eat some fried foods.  The open kitchen with the bar next to it is very inviting to chat with the employees. There aren't very many seats other than that so maybe getting items to go is another option. The restaurant could use a deep cleaning on the floors and such- it felt a bit grimy to me.  Also, I saw an employee serve himself a fountain drink and drink it in the kitchen. Later the same employee scratched his head/neck while behind the counter next to the stove.

I couldn't eat anything there because of how disgusted I was with some serious hygiene concerns:  1. Started off with a dirty chair - crumbs and drips of liquid- no big deal, I understand. I asked the waitress wipe it down which she happily did, yet for the fact she only wiped down half if the chair..... Oh well I am hungry, I will sit in the still wet chair with unknown liquid....  2. Saw the cook with his gloves on wipe his nose with his gloves. Like a strong finger length swipe of the nostril.  He didn't change his gloves after that. His gloves were also clearly moistened so you can tell that his hands were sweating under the gloves which makes me wonder, how long have those gloves been on?   3. Next a different cook comes out into the dining room with gloves on again- gets himself a drink of water. I can clearly can see water drips through them. He then takes a napkin to his nose and wipes- does not change gloves. Then this guy tries to take our order, same gloves - pointing at the menu what are the featured items, giving me a closer view of the gloves to confirm, yes your hands are sweating bullets under these gloves which appear to have been on for at least 3 hours...  This guy was really nice and the food sounded awesome but the more and more I had to witness this weird Glove phenomenon.... I couldn't even order. Who wears gloves in the dining room of a restaurant????  My husband got his food to go, but I am pregnant and after viewing everyone w gloves on and wiping noses, getting personal drinks, taking orders, even flipping through a magazine, and then apparently not changing gloves - too much for me to risk a food borne illness or any other germ.  Really sucks the menu looked great too. Everyone was nice, it was just so awkward and the most disturbing thing is that these folks seemed to act like it was no big deal to not change gloves, which makes me wonder goes on behind the scenes in terms of cleanliness.

She then proceeded to take an order at one table, ring up another table, and check on one more table before returning to take our order.  Okay, this was fine. Sort of. What ruined the visit for me was how she chewed her gum, open-mouth and all, while took our order. She didn't look at us, and didn't say anything when she presented us with our receipt to sign. No enthusiasm or care for anything, especially our business. That makes me angry.   We both got the 'Chicago Dog'. Since the dogs are made with Boar's Head meat, they did have pretty good flavor.

After delving off menu a few times, I think it's the most solid they have to offer.   My  favorites out of the hot dog is the Las Vegas chili dog or chicago dogs. I also often get the sausages, mostly hot links. Hot dogs are Boars head so they have natural casings or you can get other types without the snap, even a white hot dog/veal one. Sides wise their fried green beans with wasabi mayo is really good. To drink get Sprechers root beer off the tap! Also their raspberry ice tea isn't that regular Lipton soda fountain stuff, it's brewed so that is good too.   Stick with that and I think you'll have a good dinner here. Cheap, good American type food.  Seeing as they won some  best of  burgers,  thought their burgers would be fantastic, but it isn't any different from any old greasy spoon. Also fish type stuff, is pre battered so not anything you can't do at home with some Gordon's. I feel like some stuff is offered, just to offer it. I thought the turkey burgers, grilled chicken sandwiches and tuna melt were decent though.   My one thing about this place is that do not come at peak hours. I don't know if the owner is too cheap to hire another person but they really need more than one waitress, there's never been two waitresses I've ever seen. We went recently where it hit max capacity in this small place and she was in the weeds the whole time. It was hard to flag her down for some extra sauce, I had to wait a long time by the cash register, I just got up to serve ourselves some drinks (good thing I did not get raspberry tea that was behind the register). She already is running around like mad even when it's not a full house so they really need two people at least during the rush. It's not fair to the poor gal or to customers. I know it's not her fault, but some people were upset...and it sucks if she gets crapped on for something she cannot control at all. I'm going to stick with going only in the odd hours.

When I walked in I was planning on ordering take out, and stepped straight to the counter where the menu was.  There were two guys (cooks) there in the open kitchen behind the bar, and there was zero greeting, so I decided whatever and seated myself as the sign says.  A young lady comes out and greets me and takes my drink order.  I order a root beer (which I was not aware that it was the non-refill type), the root beer was quite good and the highlight of the meal, so I will give it that.  I look over the menu a little more and decide on the chili dog and chili cheese fries, which I figured I couldn't go wrong with.  This is where my disappointment began, now I was pretty hungry not having eaten for several hours because of traveling so again I was looking forward to this...the fries were over cooked, and the chili had little to no taste, even after adding salt and pepper.  I ate most of them because I was hungry and they cost me good money.  Next was the chili dog which I was already worried about because of the fries, the dog comes out and it is pretty plain, just chili on top and nothing too large for $4+ and so I take a bit and yep I was right nothing special, same no taste chili and the hotdog is just average (Costco has better hotdogs), the cheap bun falls apart half way through for no reason (it wasn't the chili) and so that make it even worse.  Truthfully I wanted to just get up and leave as my server (who was a nice girl) had disappeared, and the two cooks wouldn't have even noticed or cared.  But I finished most of my meal and paid and left.  I wont be going back as there is nothing to go back for, tasteless food, average service, below average atmosphere.

I really think that service is the key to great reviews and even if the food or product isn't good most would at least consider a second chance in order for one's to redeem themselves just because of great service. But in my case that service never really came. I went to the place after work one night. After seeing it the day prior while on that side of town, I was excited to see something outside the typical here and there fast food. Plus it never hurts to see so many good reviews on yelp.  I drove out of my way that night and made it to the restaurant about 8:15. I admit I was apprehensive being out late and not familiar with the place and its operating hrs but after seeing a small group of what appeared to be customers because the waitress was serving them drinks and clearly reading the sign outside for a minute or so I proceeded in. I was happy to see a employee come hastily over to what I thought was  greet me but instead of that he rudely said that they closed at 8 and that I needed to go. I was shocked and embarrassed. He walked away never said sorry or please come again just walked away. I then left but not after reading the sign again which clearly stated 9 p.m. I also considered that the doors were still open. I sat in the parking lot and watched for a few minutes and also noted that no-one came to lock the doors which is standard procedure for most places when closing and not wanting any other patrons to make same mistakes but nothing happened.  I watched as the waitress continued to serve the group inside. 5 minutes passed and another tray of food came out to the group. I drove away quite upset vowing never to even attempt to come again. I suggest to anyone interested not to come after 8 or you just might be wasting your time because they clearly don't want to serve anyone according to the sign in the window.

What other places was this up against? Come on!  The restaurant interior is typical strip mall fare, with the griddle and deep fryers right in the open. The menu features hot dogs, sausages, burgers, sandwiches, fish...you name it. The key words to this menu are: frozen, premade, generic, and Boar's Head. Think generic pre-packed sausages and dogs, frozen patties, frozen fries... Sitting at the counter by the griddle I witnessed them pulling their sausages out of Boar's Head packages, frozen patties thrown right on the griddle, generic frozen crinkle cut fries dumped right out of their plain grocery store bags into a measuring bowl and into the fryer. While sitting near the griddle the only 'fresh' items I noticed were the pre-cut veggies they were pulling out of the fridge to throw on the griddle.  My frozen burger patty was dropped right on the grill to be overcooked with everything else on there. The meat was very generic, not that flavorful, and definitely not the winner of any 'best of' contest I can think of. There was a huge piece of tough, thick lettuce on the burger, a small amount of mushrooms I could barely taste, well-melted swiss cheese and a couple of thin tomato slices. The bun was grilled well, but extremely plain and non-existent. Nothing about this burger stood out, other than the fact I could find it in any backyard bbq or at an overpriced crappy food stand at any sports event.  The thin, overcooked generic fries were exactly that. I can't stress how ridiculously typical this meal was; I would give it a fairly negative review just on all that, but combine it with the 'best burger' claim and it infuriates me. To top it off my meal came to $13.26, which is equal to or more than plenty of other fantastic burgers I've eaten all around town that are definitely worthy of some best burger claims in many categories. I can't recommend paying to eat anything here because you could purchase pretty much the same ingredients at any grocery store and do what they do in your backyard.

I went with the Pastrami burger which was slightly over cooked with grilled onions, spicy mustard and melted provo with pastrami piled on top of a 1/3 LB meat patty.  Good combo, I do like a little heavier mustard on mine which I added. Besides the burger having a char to it this definitely satisfied my burger craving I had today.    To accompany my burger I went with the Italian Fries topped with Italian seasoning and grated parmesan cheese. These were tasty fries.  The parmesan began melting which made them even better half way through the meal.    Overall visit was solid, I will be back to try one of there monster dogs.

She brought me a sample. It's made with a sage sausage, it's a lot like the country gravy I make for biscuits and gravy.  I ended up ordering a patty melt. Cheese, grilled onions, burger on grilled dark rye. It was good, not great, but good. The burger patty was lacking, it appeared to be a frozen formed patty, dry after cooking. The preparation, of the sandwich, was great, with a fresh burger patty, that was still juicy, it would have been a great sandwich.  The server, I didn't get the name, an attractive young lady at lunch time on 6/19/2014. She was friendly, helpful, attentive, everything a person in customer service should be.   I've read all the reviews, they allude to the burgers winning awards, so my burger may have been an aberration.

Funny thing is, I saw the Great Links sign and I actual went in this place for a hot dog, got lost in the menu and ended up ordering a burger.

Ok, no more man bashing! I like men, might even review them as a a group, However, decided not to resist the joke. So, no offense right? Plus, I'm about to tell you all about a great place. so forgive me, this one time. Ok, locally owned, which I LOVE. Family has fought hard to keep the place going and has had some incredible challenges, including the wife's battle with cancer.  However, they remain committed to good food, good service, and good attitudes. I know they won a burger competition put on by Fox 5. Not much staff turnover which tells me a lot. They had a coupon in last year's Entertainment Book.  I haven't checked the new one.  Haven't seen them on Groupon or Living Social. I need to check Restaurants.com, Prices are fair without a coupon though and they have meal deals. Before I forget, they offer some very interesting vegetarian options. I would order one to try it, but who am I kidding? I'm there for the dogs. Sometimes, I'm there for the clams. Sometimes, for the rueben, but never for the veggies. Wait, do breaded and fried mushrooms count? Incredibly large menu, which I'm sure they do to please customers but must be hard to maintain. They even do breakfast. My favorite is the Atlanta dog. Not to be a diva, but I special order mine and they always remember.  I like the dog in the natural casing.  They do the dog a little longer for me. They also take the cole slaw out of the fridge before they start the dog cause I don't want cold slaw to cool off the hot dog. Ok, feel free to groan. I swear I didn't mean the pun. I try to be a woman of integrity, so I'm going to leave it.  I also like the red onion sauce - that might be the NY dog. Shame that I was born in NY and I'm not sure which is my dog.  Doesn't matter cause the dogs are described on the menu. :Plus you can order whatever you would like. I'm not much of a fry girl, but you need to order them here.  They offer different kinds and great toppings.  They have beer, which I haven't had yet.  Well, I've had beer, just not at Great Links. They have ice cream and shakes, both of which I have had and enjoyed. Great local place with quality junk food.

If you go here expect a line because great food joints have lines and Great Links usually has a line, if there is a line just wait till a seat opens up, it is worth the wait.  First the staff, these guys and gals are AWESOME .............. this place is like Cheers and even if they don't know your name they will make you feel at home.  Now the food, where to start ................. EVERYTHING IS AWESOME!!!!!!!  They offer two styles of hot dogs, the natural casing or as they would tell you, the casing that  snaps , and the skinless casing. Both are 100% beef, I am a skinless guy myself but I have had both and I would not turn down either.   There are twenty nine, yep, 29 different hot dogs & sausage items on the menu and they are all mouth watering, remember when you were a boy, how freaking awesome is summertime delicious!!!!!  the Las Vegas Chili Dog is the bomb, the Philly Griller Dog is delectable, the Mob Boss Dog is exquisite, and the Louisiana Hot Link is Extraordinary.  I love their old school crinkle cut fries, the burgers are tasty, juicy goodness and don't even get me going about the atmosphere of the place .................. it is one of those places where you feel at home the first time you walk in the door.

The peppers and onions had a great flavor and there was a fair amount of cheese sauce. I also had some  Italian Fries  priced at $4.29 and had my choice of shoestring or crinkle-cut. I chose the shoestring and it was tossed in a garlic butter sauce and topped with parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning. These were good! I asked for a side of ranch to dip them in and the ranch was good. Our server was nice and checked on us often.

Easily located using the technological divining rod that is the yelp app, the team rolled in after the 11:00 hour.  Parking was a breeze as was the seating despite the potential for tight quarters during a rush.  The menu boasts over 152 hot dog and sausage combinations.  Again, according to the menu, their hot dogs are custom made by Boar's Head.  Your gonna get 7 1/2 inches of natural cased beef and pork.  I set my sights on the Deluxe Chili Cheese Dog w/ chili on the side.  The contents included cheddar cheese, bacon, onions and jalapeños.  What really got the party started was the portion of the menu containing the specialty fries!  Once again, the menu states there are over forty different combinations to customize your order.  We decided to order three off the menu with only a few minor tweeks at the recommendation of our on point and truly wonderful server, Michelle.  They included the following:  Italian Fries- With Italian seasoning, parmesan cheese and a tasty garlic butter sauce on top of recommended crinkle cuts fries.  Next up was the Buffalo Cheesy Fries- Recommended tater tots tossed in a mild buffalo sauce, and topped with melted cheese. Grill Master Fries- Recommended shoestring fries smothered in cheese, grilled onions, and thousand island dressing.  As the baskets of addictive potato masterpieces came out to the table, and they allicited multiple OMG responses.  Their beauty was only matched by their taste as they dropped on my tie and on my lap of which I did not care... I was in a high starch and fat high.  Once I came to, my boss was kind enough to offer their water so I could spot clean.  My dog was good but nothing compared to fries which could have easily been meal onto it's self.  All this goodness was washed down with a 22 ounces glass of Death Vally Root Beer.  They also serve beer.

Buffalo cheesy fries - slightly tangy sauce with melted cheese. They weren't salty or spicy but were good. Guacamole jalapeño burger - I devoured this. The guacamole was creamy.

The mustard had just the right kick. The pastrami complimented the burger in such the right way.  Kraut dog - oh snap... Literally! It was so good. Just enough spicy mustard and kraut.

We live in Henderson, so it took a lot to convince my roommate to drive the 30 miles one way -- I had to offer to pay LOL so off we went. I ordered NY Street Dog, waffle fries & BBQ Western Burger w/bacon. I have to admit when the food got to the table, in the cute little bar style baskets -- I turned to my roommate and said  disgusting . It was so gross, to me (and I'm from the west coast) but it was all Chicago style -- like a mess. It wasn't the type of food you can just pick up and eat, the bun - from both the hot dog and the burger were just saturated, wet, soggy, mushy like dough like gross - which is where my  disgusting  game from. So the hotdog was some type of pressed meat type of hot-dog, like a cheap hot dog and it was not grilled. It was not a good, high quality hot dog at all. What I didn't like was it was all pink - inside and out I don't know I like my hotdogs grilled with like grill marks on the outside. This dog sat down in the soggy bun covered with sour croute and mustard. I bit off the one end and pushed the hotdog over to my roommate. He cut his burger in half and gave me half - same thing, and I wanted to take a picture but I felt silly - it was a big piece of mush. Seriously like ¾ of it had been dipped in BBQ sauce........... It seems like the BBQ burger had some kind chili on it or something but it was all over saturated with BBQ/Chili sauce. I took a bite, the burger itself seemed like a good burger - and I did like the actual meat of the burger itself but as the BBQ sauce got all over my hands and fingers it was a mess, yucky - I set the rest of the burger in its basket and pushed it away. I went to the bathroom to wash my hands. Oh ya and they were out of waffle fries - so we opted for the  natural  fries, which ya, were very greasy. We ate all of the fries, because we were hungry and both of us not too happy with the meals - the little sauces that came with the fries was good  some kind of Cajun sauce and what seemed to be tarter.

The hot dog tasted good, them seem to have a good product, only problem was, the restaurant was hotter than my dog. The Louisiana link was good. Spicy! No complains there. The cheese fries, I would suggest not getting. They where soggy. It almost seemed like cheap frozen fries from the grocery store, microwaved and drowned with cheese.

They never refilled our drinks. They also forgot one of the items of my order, and brought it out once we were done and we reminded her. Don't order the clam chowder, it wasn't good, barely any clam and you could tell it was heated in the microwave. The Italian beef/ sausage combo is okay. The sausage was much better than the actual Italian beef part. Overall, not a good experience. Won't be coming back.

After all the times we have eaten here, we still haven't even scratched the surface of their menu! Everything I have tried has been absolutely amazing! So far my favorites are the NASCAR specials (I really wish they would still serve last year's special though) and their Italian fries. The prices are extremely resonable, we usually order 2 dogs (or burgers/sandwiches), 2 orders of fries, 2 soft drinks and a kids meal (includes drink and cookies for dessert) and I don't think we have ever paid more than $25.   The quality of their food is top-notch and the food is always served piping hot and fast. The thing that really makes this place worth visiting is the service. I always see the owner there which is a true sign of pride in ownership and Michelle is one of the hardest working people I have ever met. The place is always packed with people and yet the staff manages to keep everyone happy and they do it with a smile on their face even though you know thay have got to be exhausted!   They also keep the place very clean both in the dinning area, grill area and the restrooms. One of my biggest pet peeves is a dirty bathroom... I have been know to actually walk out of a place because of the condition of the bathroom (I'm kind of a germ-a-phobe when it comes to public toilets), I can honestly say that Great Links has one of the cleanest bathrooms I have ever seen in a restaurant.  I've heard through the grape vine that the owners are having some financial trouble recently and despite the success of Great Links may be forced to close their doors. I truley hope this does not happen. I tell everyone I know about this place in hopes that the increase in business will help keep this place going even though it means they will be even busier and I will probably have to wait more, it is definitely worth the wait!", "Date": "2012-07-16", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Liz", "ReviewID": "hQT_JDM8yDD_ggOfQTYw6Q", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I found this place on Yelp when I was looking for a good place for our group of 7 to eat lunch.

Let's face it, Chili dogs, burgers and fries just go together with a night of drinking and poker.  I wasn't about to offer Sweet Tomatoes express as a suggestion for our pre-game snack.  Right when I walked in I noticed a big board on the counter detailing their win as the Best Burger in Las Vegas.  I remember seeing some stuff about this contest on Fox 5 and John Curtas was one of the guest judges, so I figured it had some clout behind it.  I asked the waitress about it because I wanted to order the EXACT burger that won, and she was actually very upfront about how the contest was set up, and that it did have exclusions (I don't believe my current favorite Bachi was able to be represented due to cost, same with Burger Bar)   Hmmmm, doubt already started setting in.   Turns out the burger that won that contest was the Jalapeno Guacamole burger, which turned out to be the one that I was most interested in anyhow, bonus!  Cayenne Mayo, Tomato, Grilled onions and jalapenos, pepperjack cheese, and an onion ring filled with guac.  Yeah, sign me up!     My friend and I decided to share a side, and while I pushed for one of the actual french fry concoctions, he asked if I wanted to share the Frito Pie.  Uh, I guess.  When the food arrived (after a few beers, naturally), the burger looked impressive.  I'm all about saving the best for last though so I tackled the Frito Pie first.  Eh, tasted just like Frito Pie.  I guess I shouldn't knock it since it tasted exactly what a Frito Pie should taste like, but I was hoping for a bit of ingenuity or something that might set it apart.  After cursing my friend for twisting my arm into ordering that and not one of their fry options, I bit into the burger.  I got exactly what I expected and wanted out of it:  greasy, flavorful, and messy.  I felt like a star of a Carl's Jr commercial, except not nearly as hot.  I had also ordered the 1/2 lb version instead of 1/3, and that wasnt necessary even though I ate the entire thing.  So all in all, the burger was very tasty, even though I still prefer places like Bachi, Fuku, and maybe even In N Out.  I wouldn't recommend the Frito Pie and would imagine their fries are probably pretty damn tasty (shakes fist at friend).

I really have no excuse. It's close to home, has great Yelp reviews, and even has veggie dogs on the menu. Come to find out not only do they have offer veggie hot dogs, they have a full blown vegetarian faux meat menu that includes veggie chili, brats, cheese steak, bacon, and chicken nuggets! Veggie items are priced the same as their meaty counterparts. I squealed in excitement and vowed to be a regular customer if the food was good. Ladies and gents, I was not disappointed.   DELUXE CHILI CHEESE DOG ($5.49): Covered in vegetarian chili, cheddar cheese, and jalapeno slices (sans onions). A few slices of veggie bacon were tucked in the veggie hot dog. Tasted awesome, and I'm so glad to have an eatery that really caters to the vegetarian community. I only wish the cheese was more melt-y. 4/5  LAS VEGAS CHILI DOG ($5.49): This dog comes with white chili and is an upgraded version to the traditional dog. Cayenne sour cream and pepper jack cheese were some of the unexpected ingredients. Husband liked it! 4/5  ITALIAN FRIES ($4.29): Loaded with parmesan cheese. Not what I'm used to but we were happy with these fries. 4/5  ZUCCHINI STYX ($4.99): These were just okay. Probably won't order them again. The zucchini was too squishy. 2/5  VIBE: Small, casual hot dog joint. 4/5  SERVICE: Upon walking in, we thought we were supposed to order at the counter but we were instructed to sit down at a table. Our waitress was super nice and checked in on us often. As we left the guys working behind the counter waved and bid us a friendly farewell. 4/5  GOOD TO KNOW: They have a BOGO coupon in the Entertainment Book, up to $6.

To top it off, this gem of a server had the same blue rubber gloves on that he used to handle food with during the order. The same ones he had on during check out for other people and the same ones he brought soda with. Not the cleanest. Other patrons expressed the same annoyance to this guy's demeanor. Who knows why he was such a jerk.  Food was ho hum, especially since we felt so unwelcomed and rushed at 6pm on a Monday night. Not as we had anticipated at all. Horrible experience.

I tried another bite when common sense set in and my only thought was,  your body is trying to tell you something, don't eat it .

We were scouring around town to find a great place for hot dogs and so far fell short... until Great Links.  The first time we ate here, we were literally overwhelmed by the selection here. I mean in addition to hot dogs, you have burgers, sammys, a selection various fried items smothered with a different toppings and salads. And for you vegetarians out there, they have a mighty fine selection of veggie kielbasa, bratwurst, italian sausage, hamburgers. I've never heard of veggie kielbasa, but I thought that was a pretty brilliant thing.  Personally, being of the meat eating persuasion, I ordered myself a grilled chicken salad. Yeah boring I know. But honestly, my company was instituting this whole exercise/eat right initiative and I felt obligated to participate. (I have since fallen off the bandwagon.) Really at a place like this, I wasn't really expecting much because it is a burger/hot dog joint after all. I was surprised though. Although it's romaine, it's clearly freshly chopped (note, none of that early brownish tinge you get when it's been cut a long time ago) with other veggies.They have a very simple oil and vinegar dressing that hit the spot. Plus, the chicken was plentiful and moist. For less than $7, it's far superior to many grilled chicken salad in the same price range.  The hubs couldn't help but try their artisan root beer. For us soda drinkers, it's got that real root beer-ish, herbacious flavouring (in an absolutely good way) that brought us back to the good ol' days. A must try!  Not being on a company diet, the hubs has had the rueben, their KC Masterpiece Nascar special featuring Boarshead sausage, their italian sausage and side orders of their fried zucchini, regular shoestring fries and freshly cut french fries. Their reuben was pretty great while the KC Masterpiece Nascar special was a little overwhelming with all the cheese, BBQ sauce on it - it kind of detracted from the flavours of the sausage. Regardless, their plainer renditions fare better - the casings got a nice snap to it.  The sides were a hit or miss. The fried zucchini's batter was a little too heavy and fell apart when you picked it up. Their fresh cut fries don't have quite the crispiness that I look for in a french fry. I prefer their shoestring fries which were much crispier and lighter -- FYI - their shoesting is more the size of your standard McDonald's french fries.

And, the options were enough for a couple visits or infrequent visits. For a weekend visit to Vegas, my bro and I visited twice.  With that said, vegetarian options doesn't mean healthy. Nor do they or we profess to be healthy. The meals are  stick to your ribs  good tasty meals. This is a place where the carnivores and vegetarian friends can meet, share a table and watch the game. Beer, brats, and (foot/basket/base)balls.  I can't speak for my bro meals; I had the Mob Boss (grilled peppers, onions, marinara, and two mozzarella sticks) and a simple veg chili dog. Both were very tasty, wolfed them down on each occasion. Then we also shared the Grilled Master fries (similar to In-n-Out fries, animal style), buffalo cheesy fries (I liked this, could use a little more buffalo sauce), and zucchini (crispy breaded outside with well-done juicy inside) .
