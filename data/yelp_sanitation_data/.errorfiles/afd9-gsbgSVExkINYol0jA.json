We decided to make it a whole late-night meal so we ordered some tacos.  We only tried the al pastor and the carne asada and both were the best I've had anywhere.  We live in Southern California so we have tried countless little taco stands, searching for a hands-down favorite.  Well we found it!  Unfortunately for us it's this little truck in Vegas!!  I can't wait till our next Vegas trip, we'll be stopping for these tacos more than once!", "Date": "2015-01-03", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Annette", "ReviewID": "KaYpCEqDUgBFaFppLLfqPA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Best Taco's I've ever had!!!!! Made fresh Tortillas I ordered 4 tacos and they were soooooo DELICIOUS I went back for 2 more....you won't be disappointed! I'm from Sac Cali. and I'll definitely come back to this truck everytime I come to Vegas!", "Date": "2015-03-07", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Nelson", "ReviewID": "T18nsG-WN57onQ6JpSyFWQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(111/365)  New Kid on the Taco Block   Jessica R. sent me a compliment: Gone? we were there just yesterday! (Referring to Karina's #2 who used to occupy that spot) All the while I thought Karina's had returned directly across Luv-It Frozen Custard, we checked it out but sadly that wasn't the case.  Different name, different people(A guy and two women) serving up your usual spread-Tacos, Tortas, Burritos(with rice!) and something called Caramelo($2) which was basically a taco with melted cheese, so we decided to have one with Tripa(intestine) extra crispy, and that was bomb! Apparently the guy that runs this spot used to work for Karina's so that was a good sign. Oh, FRESH TORTILLAS made on the spot too!  The ladies had also mentioned that they were also serving Chiles Rellenos($7) and Coctel de Camaron($12)(this was during Lent) which sounded good to pass up, so we got them both. Rellenos were delicious and the Coctel was good, but no one does it like Los Tacos. I finished with a couple more Tacos de Tripa(no cheese this time) and at the end of our meal, we were fans. Service was great overall, and they made you feel as if you were eating in their home. Gotta love that!  Pretty decent amount of traffic, great people, and tasty looking burritos as well, we will surely return.  ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  4  *Don't know if they're still serving the Rellenos and Coctel, but they do have solid tacos! Try 'em out!  **CASH ONLY FOLKS!**", "Date": "2014-04-26", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Sylvia", "ReviewID": "xfX38tQwC-f9PP_jtKND_A", "Overall": "3", "Content": "This taco stand is A-OK.   This stand sits in the same parking lot as Luv-it Frozen Custard and the infamous OG club.  I love their tacos de tripa and I would suggest getting these extra crispy.   The only odd thing is I have seen them come straight out of a frozen bag into the fryer.  The taste is still great, just odd to me as I have never seen it done this way.  This may however be a good thing as they can tend to be a little on the gamey side if not cleaned thoroughly, so coming from a pre-package source may ensure quality.     Their burritos are also tasty and will cost you $5.50 or an extra $2.00 if choosing lengua or tripa and best of all their tortillas are freshly made.    Not a bad stop for a quick bite and the service is pleasant most of the time.  This taco stand is A-OK.   This stand sits in the same parking lot as Luv-it Frozen Custard and the infamous OG club.

They use to have this spicy sauce that will make you fart fire!! Sooo delish! I usually get the pastor tacos. A must try place if you are by downtown. They only take cash so get some doe before you head over there. The owners are super nice. Oh and they make their tortillas from scratch!", "Date": "2014-08-09", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
