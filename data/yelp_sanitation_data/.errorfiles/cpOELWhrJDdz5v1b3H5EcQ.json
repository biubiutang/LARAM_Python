We've been to all the ice cream and yogurt places on Eastern, and Layers was closed, so we wanted to try Dairy Queen.  Walking in, you get hit in the face with the smell of burnt grease. It's really foul smelling. The place was freaking packed. Literally, half of Henderson was in there ordering ice cream. The freezer case was nearly empty and it looked dirty.   I was sick of driving around and once inside, my sister spotted a weekday 2-for-1 deal going on. Mondays were bogo free banana splits, so we got that and my brother wanted a chocolate dipped cone, so I got him one of those as well. Our total came out to a little over $7. Not bad.   One thing, you better specify what sauces you want or else you'll just get the regular chocolate, pineapple and strawberry. There's something about pineapple sauce that makes me leery, so I asked them to make it marshmallow sauce instead.   The ice cream was okay. Nothing spectacular. My sister complained that the banana tasted old. I couldn't notice any difference and my brother didn't like the chocolate shell, so he made our youngest sister eat the shell off the cone. Whatever.   The weekday specials are a good deal, but it's best to not eat in the restaurant until they can get that horrid smell out and spruce up a bit.", "Date": "2011-08-16", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Shannon", "ReviewID": "xTeMPVK8kjH7dURZ1zdGIA", "Overall": "3", "Content": "This is a basic Dairy Queen - not the grillin' variety.

You know, ice cream, treats, a nice nostalgic feeling of the past for kids.  What happened to this place?  I haven't a clue.  1.  Ambiance - Been here several times now, and always the same, bland, not exciting.  2.  Service - Hmmm, perhaps they should turn this one to a self service facility, this would definitely improve the service. A guy was there waiting for his kids sundae. The servers assisted and prepared orders for two other customers that came in after. The guy goes to the server to remind them, they said it was almost ready. Then I put my order in, the guy starts to make mine and I remind him about the guy's kid from three orders ago. So, they start to make it and it takes like 10 seconds. Poor kid.  3.  Service Part 2 - they make my order and the shakes are like slightly thicker than milk. I said no whip and guess what, whip. I ordered one dipped cone and guess what, i got two. I guess you can say that this ying yang approach is balanced???  4.  Air Con - What the heck happened here? No air, no fans, hot and stuffy?  Hmmm, what would a normal store do? Offer free dipped cones!  5.  Service Part 3 - to use the toilets, you have to get a key from the cashier. Guess what, they cannot find the key.  I wonder what the dealio is since this place is usually empty anyway, no need to manager the bathroom.  This is not a bad place, the cones and stuff are decent, but the service and customer care is not in existence.", "Date": "2011-04-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Mary", "ReviewID": "Lp394_Wo4tTbVZ2kATHnxw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Pretty good hamburgers.

I was so excited to come to Dairy Queen after 9 months of fighting pregnancy cravings my family gave into me asking. Boy was this a poor decision. There was 5 of us....3 ordered Blizzards, 1 Peanut Buster Parfait and 1 Large Vanilla cone...all simple orders. Right after we ordered I noticed the girl (ended up being the manager) replacing the ice cream in the front machine because it had ran out. Instead of letting the ice cream set up for a second she immediately starts making our ice cream. First thing she makes is my fathers large cone. Came out as one lump instead of the 2 large lumps and swirl a top. I asked my dad if the ice cream was too soft because it looked horrible and he said yeah but it was still good. Next was my mothers Peanut Buster Parfait which was completely melted. She was unhappy and I told her to complain. She insisted not to. My husbands and brothers Blizzards come out and they just start devouring their melted messes not caring. It wasn't until my Blizzard came out that enough was enough. I could literally drink it as a shake! So I go up front and show them that and they remake it no problem. I believe her name was Marie who remade it. Well as I am grabbing the new one my mother decides to complain about the service. Marie walks off as my mother is talking to her. I had walked away at this point but came back when I noticed the girl who originally took our order (the manager) talking to my mom. My mom shows her Peanut Buster Parfait and the girl insists it was correct. That is when I finally say I managed a DQ for 2 years in Vegas and this is absolutely not correct. Right after I say this she says I am attacking her? I am 9 months pregnant and cannot have my blood pressure rising so at this point I decide to throw my  shake  away and leave. I am absolutely horrified by the service of this location and plan on calling corporate on Monday. I have worked in customer service my whole life and honestly if they didn't have two different lies about why the ice cream was runny I would have been willing to just take a refund and just accept it was a bad night for them and their machines. Instead I know alot about the back end of how DQ works and am now going to make 100% sure corporate understands how the owner is letting their manager treat customers!
