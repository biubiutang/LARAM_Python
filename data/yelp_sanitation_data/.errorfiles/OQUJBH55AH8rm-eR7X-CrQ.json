I was here on Tuesday, August 30th, 2016. It was a hot day and I decided it would be lovely to stop by and have an ice cream to cool down. I saw Amornio and the concept of the gelato put into cones like flower petals seemed like a cool concept.  I waited in line for a while and as I was the very next person in line, the sales agent completely blew me off and went directly to the couple after me. She didn't even bother making eye contact with me. Not sure what she thought I was doing in line. I felt embarrassed and left the establishment.

That pretty much sums up how I feel. It's that good!! This new location is at the Premium Outlets North in the new section of the mall. Is it worth braving the horrid parking and sometimes rude tourists? YES IT IS!!!   You tell the cashier what size you want and pay. She gives you a ticket to hand to one of the gelato masters and they create your tasty treat. You can sample all the flavors before you commit to putting them into your cup or cone. They don't have any weird flavor combinations, just pure and simple flavors. Everything I've tasted so far has been so flavorful, rich and smooth. Nothing artificial here. My favorites so far has definitely been pistachio and coffee. They have fruity sorbets for the non-dairy customers. They also have waffles, crepes, macarons, espresso and shakes. Can't wait to try those!!  Is it on the pricey side? Yes, just a bit. Great thing is that you can get as many flavors you want for the size you ordered. Plus, they shape your gelato into a pretty flower if you order a cone. The employees are so friendly even through all the chaos of customers.

I got a small cup and got half vanilla and half dark chocolate (71% cacao) and even got to try a flavor (just ask!).  The gelato was NOT overly sweet like most gelato in jars I've bought in markets.  The vanilla gelato actually tasted like real vanilla (it has vanilla bean specs) and the same goes for the dark chocolate - just right amount of sweetness and the taste of quality chocolate.  Of course, you cannot match the quality of gelato made right then and there, as this store imports their gelato from their place in Europe, but the quality of gelato served at this place is a step up (if not several more) from the gelato I've bought before.

Trying to pronounce L'Inimitabile is L'intimidating; do it anyway. It's a tongue twister that rewards your taste buds.  You don't come to Amorino expecting good customer service. The gelato is made in a factory far, far away and all the products are shipped in from Europe, so there is no passion like you hope for in a true gelateria where everything is created fresh. The workers seem rushed and tend to be short with the customers. Don't expect to feel welcomed to sample multiple gelato flavors to complete the order that you've already paid for up front. You come here because you've likely been shopping in the mall for a few hours, and you're in the mood for an incredible dessert or authentic European espresso. That's what Amorino delivers, no more, no less.  There's no photo proof because my battery was dead, but I enjoyed a crepe with Amarena cherry gelato, passion fruit sorbetto, salted butter caramel sauce, and fresh whipped cream. The pre-made crepe was reheated on an authentic crepe griddle. There's no sexy French crepe-spinning theatrics here. The gelato has a perfect texture and very clean flavor worth craving, but the salted butter caramel sauce actually stood out the most. They should sell that by the jar if they don't already. My daughter ate her bite-sized raspberry gelato macaron really fast and didn't give me a taste, so I'm ordering my own next time.  I really wish Amorino would just package their very high quality gelato and distribute it to be sold at Whole Foods or Trader Joe's.

We showed up at about 3:30 PM on Aug. 25th and there was only one other person in front of us so we quickly walked over to the cashier and told her that we each wanted a small cone.  I decided on the hazelnut, which was one of my favorite flavor from their Livermore location so I didn't really need to do a taste test.  My niece, however, has never had their gelato before so she asked to sample 3 different flavors.  I don't recall which ones, but she said she liked the  yogurt  flavor best.  While we were waiting for our cones, about 4 or 5 more people decided to come in so the girl who was helping us seemed a bit irritated with us, for whatever reason.  There were 3 girls working so it shouldn't have been a problem trying to help everyone.  Being that this is Vegas, I would expect that they would do a better job at providing service to us tourists since we are the ones who spend the majority of the money keeping this place in business.

Great spot to go to after a day of shopping, or whenever you are jonezing for some serious  gelato or sorbet.   Simple, straightforward, and done right is what their gelato and sorbet flavors are. You won't find any  cool names  or  outside the box  ingredients like bacon or ghost chili ...If you are a purist, go here. Amorino is about quality, not quantity. Baked items (I saw a type of fruit cake and biscotti ) are also available, as well as granitas, and even some high end  aged balsamic vinegar too.  As you step inside, peruse the menu to decide your size and whether you want a cup, cone or other creation like their tasty waffles or crepes. Pay the cashier first, so that your hands are free, then head over to the ladies and sample any of their signature flavors before ultimately deciding what you want.   Chocoholics will love the four choices they have(3 gelato-Amorino, Ecuadorian 70%, and Inimitable AKA Chocolate -Mint,  and 1 sorbet ) Vanilla fans have either the Madagascar or more floral Tahitian Vanilla Bean Gelato to decide on, cookie butter fans will love Amorino's Speculoos gelato, if you're a nut lover, their pistachio and hazelnut are awesome, if you don't do dairy, their sorbet selections are all great, especially my favorite, the Alfonso Mango. Another flavor I always gotta have is the Amarena Cherry Gelato, which no one else in Vegas has, and their flavor of the month, Agrumi Sicilia (Mixed Sicilian Citrus) will please citrus lovers for sure.  Amorino's granitas(think Slush Puppies) are also worth trying and are only available at this location. We tried the Strawberry and the Tangerine (my favorite) which was very refreshing on a pretty warm day. Flavors will change every once in a while   With the summer heat  just around the corner, Amorino will definitely make a killing here!

We'll see if this is actually a carbon copy shortly...  The second of its chain to open in Vegas, the Amorino boutique at the Las Vegas North Premium Outlets is between Vilebrequin (whatever that is) and Pandora. It's most readily accessed from parking garage B (the northernmost one), which I learned the hard way when parking at garage A. While I've heard it promoted/hyped as a brick-and-mortar alternative to the kiosk that is the Town Square location, this is actually almost the same deal except for the two seats inside of their window. Therefore, expect to have to use outdoor seating in the middle of the corridor. Aside from the sorbet drinks, which I have yet to try, the menu is the same as the Town Square location, and prices appear to match.  After I stated my express interest in gelato to the employee, she asked me to pay up front. Afterward, I could feel free to sample and order as many flavors as I wanted. I chose the second-largest cup, which ended up being $10.50 after tax for about 10 oz worth of dessert. The flavors were mostly familiar, although the te verde alla menta (green tea w/ mint) and the seasonal cantaloupe seemed new to me. Samples that tasted fine but that I later refrained from ordering include the green tea w/ mint (tasted mostly minty, not tea-y enough), mango (one of their best flavors, just didn't feel like it), two chocolate flavors (a little too milky), Amarena cherry, pistachio, and agrumi (a blend of citrus flavors).  I ended up with six flavors. That cantaloupe was very true to a sweet, ripe cantaloupe, and it was refreshing as a sorbet recipe/texture. I also had the passion fruit sorbetto, which may well be my favorite in Vegas currently. They don't have seeds like Messina does, but the flavor isn't as saccharine sweet, which is a good thing for a tart fruit. The chocolate sorbetto had the purest chocolate flavor for me and was smooth despite lacking milk. The speculoos (basically, cookie butter) was delicious and had a bit of the crunchy biscuit to complement the smooth gelato. The hazelnut, one of my already established favorites, was rich and had a few actual hazelnuts mixed into it. Finally, the tiramisu was pretty nice but got a little lost due to its positioning and my forgetfulness. Perhaps I had one flavor too many...  There is no debating that if you want a traditional gelato with perfect texture and rich flavors, you have to visit an Amorino. However, simply having the highest-quality product isn't enough for me. Here are the drawbacks of this place that I've already mentioned:  - The lack of indoor seating still plagues this Amorino shop for those who aren't fortunate. It's an important issue not just because it sucks to be outdoors in the Las Vegas heat, but also because the gelato will melt more quickly. - Almost all of the great gelato and ice cream shops that I've visited allow you to sample their frozen products freely. This shop forces you into shelling over money before giving you the same unfettered access to samples. This may not be a problem if you already know that you'll buy gelato, but it places too much weight on the first-time visitor. It's just not a very customer-friendly practice, no matter how apologetic the employees might be (they were more  matter of fact  today, but not negative). - Speaking of which, the pricing also can't be ignored. Yes, the product probably does merit the premium, but few people are just made of money. Starting at $5.50 for a tiny cup and escalating rapidly, the pricing scale just doesn't suit most frequent gelato eaters.  Finally, there is a lack of variety here that just doesn't suit the particular type of gelato junkie that I am. Maybe it'd take longer to happen here, but I can tire easily of the same flavors, as I've realized recently with another local spot. In fact, my gelato fatigue kicked in after visiting them just once a month, not even weekly. Anyway, other places are more inventive than Amorino and churn out new flavors out weekly, and knowing that I'll have something new to try in addition to or even in place of my old favorites is what suits me.  Despite all of the negatives that I've just rattled off, Amorino has a wonderful and seemingly consistent product that largely overcomes those significant issues, so  I'm a fan  is a great description of how I feel. But although  As good as it gets!  might work for the product in a vacuum, I'm not fully sold when considering this store itself and the overall business model.", "Date": "2015-09-23", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Veronica", "ReviewID": "ijfysG1k1EoHIz2fUUqicg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "The gelato was so good.

It looks cute and elegant, but it seems like a pain to eat as the gelato is easily melting down the sides.", "Date": "2016-05-20", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Cindy", "ReviewID": "CTQ-fH7GjGN8xEiTEWLw2A", "Overall": "3", "Content": "The line was very long when we came here and it moves pretty slow as people are trying to make their perfect rose gelato cone.

Every time I'm at the Las Vegas Premium Outlets North, I have to stop by this place.  Their granitas (frozen drinks) are to die for. The tangerine granitas and strawberry granitas are my favorites, I usually have them mix both flavors for me;) If you haven't tried, I dare you to!!!  Their gelato is what brings so many customers through their doors. The uniquely craft roses out of their gelatos. You can pick your size and get up to three flavors on your gelato rose. Their gelatos flavors are out of this world! My favorite is the banana and the coffee flavors, yes, I sounds like a weird combination, but it tastes better than it sounds. The coffee gelato has actual coffee beans in it so it can be a little strong for those who don't handle coffee well. The lime basil, though sour, is super refreshing.

No indoor seating but there are a few tables outside.  How the process works: Pay 1st and get a receipt. Move a little down and give an employee the receipt. If you got gelato, tell them how many flavors you want. If you got a drink, move to the very last counter to pick up your order. Enjoy!  Note: You only get the flower shape when you get a cone.

When we were in Barcelona a few days later on Las Rambles, we finally got to try them. Very creamy and lots of flavors to try.  Our order: 2 Medium Cone #1 Banana & Tea #2 Pistachio, Tiramisu, Speculoos  Even tho we love banana, we didn't like the flavor they much. The Tiramisu had bit for the dessert in it but didn't really taste any rum. Pistachio wasn't as strong as I would've liked so it was more mute compared to the other flavors. Speculoos was good, just would've liked more chunks of the cookies. Still yummy gelato to enjoy on a warm day in Vegas while shopping. Pricy but it's not like you'll get this everyday.

They provided a few seating  chairs right in front, very cute. The picture menu was very useful to me for my first visit. The store was well-decorated and very clean. Nice menu pictures with their selection on the side. I couldn't make up my mind, everything looked so amazing, they were so many  flavors to choose from. I ended up getting some of my favorite flavors, Pistachio, Hazelnut and coffee. They went well together.  The best part that I love about this Gelato shop is that you can choose as many flavors as you want for your single cone or cup. One more thing that  very unique about this store is that they will make their gelato into a single flower shape for all the cones, it's very fun and pretty. I saw a lot of customers tried to create their own colorful flower, what a genius idea!   I had my small cone for only $5.99, amazingly delicious, I finished it in a couple minutes, no kidding.

The selection of flavors was decent, but the service, as others have noted, wasn't very friendly.

The mall itself was pretty busy... This gelato place not so much. Gotta Love no lines!   The service... The girls at the counter were all very nice. They knew which items were vegan and which items weren't... Big plus in my book. They offered us samples and never got annoyed when we wanted to try something different. They were excited about their product and made us excited about it too!   The ambiance... It was a long store... Not very wide. Not very many tables inside, but their were a few. Unfortunately, most were occupied with patrons or people trying to figure out the menu. They have both tall and short tables located outside so we opted for a tall one. It was pretty warm and our gelato melted rather quickly :(. The inside has a very rustic Italian charm. Dim lighting and appetizing menu boards get the mood going.  The product... It was not the best gelato I've had... Well to be honest, I really only was able to have to the sorbet... I opted for the organic dark chocolate sorbet and the banana sorbet. The chocolate was delicious! I would definitely order it again. The banana was underwhelming with a weird after taste, but it was still okay. I think it needed more banana. I chose the classic size... It looked like the first size up from what appeared to be a kids cup. It wasn't very big... The plus side to this place is that they allow as many flavors in one cup as you want for no extra charge. The down side... The price... Perhaps I should of asked considering prices were not posted any where (minus one star). I am in no way cheap, but it was definitely Disney land pricing in an outlet mall. Two classics rang in at 9.25 each... 18.50 for two small sorbets was just a tad bit steep in my book for average product.
