The loud music is expected & understood since this place has a club open until people choose to leave. The last 4 times I've been there have been horrible. TV was broken & the repair guy works early hours even though this place is a late night hours spot. Many times I booked the hotel with champagne & nothing was in the room. I'd call down to be told it would be right up & it would be a few hours. Once they even forgot. Same thing happened for a hair dryer that's suppose to be in the room. I recently started staying at the Rumor, a sister property, & I like it better but there is no club to take advantage of. The best Artisan ever did was take some small charge off of my room for not having a tv. I told these nightmare issues to employees at the Rumor & many of them have heard these complaints from customers & have said some of their clientele used to stay at the Artisan but no longer. They'd rather just take a cab or Uber to the club. The extra expense is worth it trust me. I don't know if I'll ever stay there again. I've managed to avoid it for about 1 1/2 years now. It's sad I used to brag about my experience there.

I was introduced to this place by a local friend of mine on one of my visits a few years ago and I fell in love. Today it's one of my absolute favorite places to visit when I go to Vegas. From the outside it's quite funny because it's very industrial looking and it's on a street filled with nothing but strip clubs. But once you get inside it is entering a different world. The decor alone is what is so attractive about this place. It's unique without being pretentious. There's always a great place to lounge and socialize. I love the location-- just off the strip.   Though what sucks is they only have valet parking. And another tip is if you're visiting better do your research and make sure no special events are going on. Last time I went there were a lot of people there and I was hit on a couple times but I politely declined.... when I met my local friend for lunch the next day he told me there was a swingers party there.

I rarely give 5 stars however in this case I wish I could give it 10 stars   My bf surprised me with a 2 night stay here because he knew how bad I wanted to try this place out.   Let me tell you I was in HEAVEN! This place is like no other a hidden jewel, It's boutique and definitely unique!   So we stayed 2 nights and he got this package that included the room and breakfast and lunch and also unlimited drinks at their lounge.   Let me start by saying when you walk in its dark and you see art EVERYWHERE. ITS GORGEOUS. The staff is super friendly, and will answer any questions you have.   The rooms are amazing very unique dark colors lots of art kinda goth a little small but I didn't need it to be any bigger it was just the 2 of us.   Their lounge is awesome great drinks and an amazing DJ super friendly bartenders and again very dark and artsie.This is where we spent most of our time and even met a few cool locals here.   Their restaurant is delicious for breakfast I ordered the french toast which was breaded in cornflakes and cinnamon mmm mmm good! For dinner I had a Caesar salad and I believe chicken Marsala very tender chicken and the service was very good.   Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to go into there beautiful pool because it was winter but its absolutely gorgeous and ill have to try it out next time.

I was a bit nervous after reading the reviews but we decided to trust our instincts and I'm glad we did!  This hotel is an amazing experience! Fine art work, mirrors, books and vintage furniture decorate the entire hotel. The young lady who checked us in was pregnant and very very helpful!  The elevator had a cool red light and played real dope music. We stayed in room 507... Each room had art painted by a different artist so we will be returning to see other pieces soon! The bed was unbelievably comfortable and we didn't get bitten by any thing like the other reviews said. The shower head had great pressure and we even had free valet!  My only criticism is that we needed a spoon and even though there is a kitchen the bar tender refused to give us one. The gentleman behind the desk literally washed off a fork that he had and gave it to me. Great problem solving but not so great bar service...

Gone are the cozy little areas to sit, unless you want bottle service. They've also removed all the tables around the bar and even the bar stools. The bartender explained to us that since they are known as an after-hours place, they don't want people sitting at the bar, because people can't get up to it to get a drink. I might have agreed with that decision,  were we not literally the only people in the bar.    On a Saturday night at 11pm there were more employees than customers and more confusion than good times to be had. We already had drinks in our hand and were sent outside to get a stamp; great job, team. The bartender had a terrible attitude...until it was time to tip her. Also, our drinks were served in plastic solo cups; how tacky is that? You charge $15 a drink and you can't afford something a little nicer? We went out the patio, where we were told we had to buy a hookah to sit at a table. A hookah? The patio was also nearly empty, so it just made us feel unwelcome and that there were far too many rules to follow for us to enjoy ourselves.    What I love about this place; the decor. It's a beautiful place, there is no denying that. I like that it's been cleaned up, because it felt like it was circling the drain the last time I stayed in a room there. I also love that there isn't any gaming. That's the end of my list, currently.   We had one drink and left.

Misti Y described it best by comparing it to the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland.  Or maybe it wasn't the best analogy, but that reference sold me.

The Artisan is a small, luxurious boutique hotel with 64 rooms. Each room is elegantly appointed by its own master artist. The lobby is dimly lit with candles, art and mirrors all over the walls and ceilings. The colors are very deep, dark and rich with lots of comfy over sized chairs, velvet curtains, a baby grand piano and fountains.   The art spans from all different eras: Baroque, Renaissance, Rubens, Gothic, Modern, and Post Modern to name a few.  There's a small restaurant in the back which looks very romantic. It is dimly lit with lots of candles, velvet and leopard print. They serve a fantastic Sunday brunch for about $20.   The lounge is absolutely breathtaking and chic. There's a D.J. on Fri. and Sat. from about 10-1 PM.

I had a good time and checked out the outside area as well which was cool.

I really dug it and it appealed to my inner artist.  However, my friend thinks the bartender has it out for her and did NOT recommend we order the mai tais as they're  sour.  I ordered a French martini which she was curious to what it was made of. When I named off the ingredients, the bartender sort of blanched and said,  we have only a drop of Chambord left. I was going to sub some raspberry syrup in.  Okay, that's fine but I wonder if he was going to tell us if I hadn't known the drink?  In any case, they were good enough to have two rounds of them. I loved that the bar has hooks for purses. Supposedly the place is very much hopping on Friday and Saturday nights and they tend to have a live DJ. My friend also said a lot of the performers for various shows hang out at the bar here. But we came on a Sunday night and it was fairly dead.

WTF happened to this place?  Every time I come here now, there are a bunch of ghetto ass people with even some sagging their pants down to the knees.  A bunch of annoying punks as well in the parking lot, drunk as hell talking sh*t.  Did someone pass out a flyer of this place in the ghetto and skanky side of vegas?  If i wanted drunk girls that all dressed in tight short, easy access dresses, I would have gone to Tao, XS and all these other nightclubs in the strip, but apparently they come here in the high numbers now also.  I am not feeling the type of people it attracts at all and I'm sure they would feel the same about the trendy and hippy crowd in downtown vegas.

Its free for locals and open 24 hours on friday and saturdays. The crowd is whatever, and the back patio is a nice place to throw down on a conversation.  For my money its the best place for random run ins, example, a couple weeks ago my Mclovin looking friend starts laying random  I just broke up with my girlfriend so I really dont give a f**k  style convo into a brunette about 3 leagues above him. She bites and they talk for a while and when the number exchange came, she said,  you can find me on twitter, its @jennyhendrix .

But beware when walking in because it is really really dark after coming in from outdoors.  Not knowing the layout of the lobby many obstacles may get in your way as yours eyes are adjusting.  We check into a small clean room in a gothic kind of decor pretty cool.  Sadly 2 of the 4 rooms we had, the air-conditioning broke.  The staff worked hard on it and it worked well enough to not want to repack and move rooms.  As mentioned in previous posts there are speakers located all around the hotel with Techno music blasting.  I did not mind this much because we were here for a party not a spa day...

Wow was I mistaken.  We arrived Friday afternoon and were impressed with the decor and the design of this hotel. It is really unique and for those into this sort of look (turn of the century Parisian art gallery with a little bit of a hipster brothel thrown in for fun), it's gorgeous. The staff seemed friendly enough and the front bar was cute and seemed a nice place to grab a drink before we headed out for the night.   When we returned at around 1130, we were greeted by two no-necked stereotypical huge doormen in suits who asked for our ID's even though we were guests of the hotel. As we walked to the elevator to go up to our room we noticed that the bar had gotten louder and the music was that annoying no melody thumping bad techno. But whatever, not my scene, but I'm okay with whatever they want to do.   Until we arrived back in our room on the 3rd floor and realized that the bass from the bar downstairs was SO LOUD it was rattling our beds and making it impossible to sleep. The hotel had pre-warned us that things get loud and offered us earplugs. They didn't help. About 4 am, after no sleep, I finally called the front desk to try to get us moved UP to a higher floor number where maybe the noise level would be lessened. BRIAN answered the phone and offered NO HELP. He was rude and unapologetic, not to mention simply uninterested. After taking a rather strong sleeping pill at 4 am and still using the earplugs, I finally was able to get some sleep.   The next morning, we asked again about moving up to a higher floor to try to avoid the thumping. Though the morning staff was a bit more apologetic, they still seemed really uninterested and it took us pestering the front desk clerk all day to get them to move us to the 4th floor.  While waiting for the room switch, we decided to go have a lounge by the pool. The pool is just like the club all over again. A guy who looked like a reject from Jersey Shore DJ'ed all afternoon and kept the music SO Loud we couldn't talk, and there were several groups of Jersey Shore wannabes being louder and raucous and obviously drunk. Our pool experience was ruined as well.  Finally getting into our now on the 4th floor room late in the afternoon, I was just happy to get the hell out of there and go out to meet some friends in town, but again, when we returned around midnight, the noise level was again SO LOUD that the bass was thumping through the floor - even 2 floors above the club. Though at least this time, it was muffled enough that with the earplugs allowed me to get some sleep - even though I could still hear it a bit.   This place is ridiculous. It is trying way too hard to be cool. It is low class no matter what the decor looks like. The food in the restaurant is just OK, not spectacular. The cast of Jersey Shore would love it. I did not.

And let me say this...  If we hadn't have already booked rooms elsewhere for the other three nights we were there I wouldn't have left the Artisan.  The best things about the place are:  Every single member of the staff that I dealt with was very, very courteous, friendly, and helpful. I'm talking from the Valet, to the Doorman, to the Front Desk, everyone was fantastic.  This place is BEAUTIFUL. The paintings, the furniture, the design of the place... it took my breath away. It's an incredible mix of Gothic and impressionist renaissance art and design. From the statues that I wanted to take home, to the ornate black fountain in the lobby, to the wall to ceiling (yes literally, on the ceiling) art that ranged from Monet, to Dali, to Picasso, to Degas, to Van Gogh, to the wrought iron doors and wooden carvings, my inner goth girl was in heaven. Even the chapel made me wish I was getting married again just so I could use it. I have so many pictures I took of this place that it's unreal. It's really a sight to behold.  The rooms are all themed to a certain artist. We happened to get Room 219 which is a Salvador Dali room. It was gorgeous and super clean. Paintings everywhere, mirrors, a black ceiling fan, ice cold air conditioning, and wall to wall black tile bathroom were awesome. It even had an ornate wooden desk to be able to sit at, as well as a plush black velvet chair you could sink into.   Also, I was on the second floor while they had the pounding music at the bar underneath and I barely heard a thing. I don't know if people are just being too sensitive or what, but I slept like a baby. Btw, the beds are super comfy and the linens are plush and bright white.   Seriously, I've been to MANY hotels, including the ones I stayed at the rest of my trip and NONE of them will top my experience at the Artisan. I can't recommend it enough.

Maybe it was due to the fact that I had driven directly from the UK Consulate that evening and had become accustomed to graceful, dignified service, but this is where the experience fell apart for me.  Once I got to the room, it was beautiful and cozily appointed, but I had to call the concierge desk to ask how to stop the message light from blinking.  Again, more attitude.  Sorry.

We were impressed with the dim lighting and eclectic decor. It was decorated for Halloween which only added to the ambiance of the hotel. It is like entering an art museum. There are paintings lining the walls and tiny guilded mirrors randomly placed covering the ceilings. The club is mostly after hours and the music is great and is loud and gets the energy going. The hallways are covered in interesting art work and paintings. It is a very sexy hotel and although we didn't notice very much or were approached or made to feel uncomfortable by anyone we were told by other visitors that it is a notorious swinger's hotel. The hotel motto is  Everything you can imagine is real  and they were right. It's a very laid back hotel and the staff treats you like old friends and you will get to know everyone in just a few short days.  They go above and beyond to meet any needs or demands. They will have you sign a release saying you will be able to hear the music in your room until 8am. It is true that you can hear the bass but it IS vegas and if u party hard enough its hardly noticeable! We liked being able to just stay at the hotel to party at night. It gets busy after 3 and full of locals. The floors weren't very noisy in the hallways of the hotel,  in fact we rarely saw anyone else. The view from our room was air conditioners on the roof but we weren't staying for the view. My only real complaint was that their restaurant doesnt open until 5pm and no breakfast or brunch is offered. They will give you tons of close by options if you ask. Hash House was the best recommendation for breakfast. Michael is the manager and loves his job and it shows in the pride he takes to make sure you are satisfied with your stay. There were perks with our reservation like a complementary bottle of champagne. It is a valet only hotel and the valet guys are friendly, funny and laid back. Ryan at Valet made our visit so much more fun and was so helpful with assisting us in getting around. We would hang out at the bar during slow hours just to talk to the bartenders.

Hard. Okay...here goes. I'm not a kid, I'm a grown-up and as such have stayed in some pretty amazing hotels. In fact, it's been a very long time since I've stayed in anything even remotely close to what I'd call a  flea-bag  hotel. But I was coming in for the catering convention and really wanted to avoid the hustle and bustle of crazy casino hotels and love the boutique experience. Mandarin was over $400 and thought that the Artisan looked super funky and fun and it seemed close to the strip (on my computer screen at least!), so why not! So here's the straight dope on the Artisan -- it's located miles from anything in a TERRIBLE part of town. Surrounded by strip clubs and industrial strip malls it'll cost you a nice cab ride to get anywhere (and there is nothing to eat here during the week!) so factor that into your final cost savings. But primarily, I did not feel safe at all. Now on to the hotel itself. Drive up is cute with nice first appearance, although I wasn't greeted by anyone, which was my first clue that something was amiss. The lobby is dark and interesting. Very quiet and cool with floor to ceiling (literally!) art -- but the emphasis here is on quantity, not quality - just a bunch of junk really. Still I appreciated what they were putting forth and thought it was kitsch and fun. Front desk was nice enough, but could have been warmer. They told me that they couldn't let me pay the additional fee for early check-in because they were sold out the night before. Now...I was checking in on a Tuesday, which meant they were sold out on a Monday. A hem.....when I tell you there was not a SOUL in this hotel I kid you not. I saw one couple only the entire time I was there, so I suspect what they were saying was that they bring their staff in to clean up after the weekend on Monday and Tuesday and just take their time???? It was strange. I took the elevator to my room and the hallway just had the strangest, scariest fung shui - can't explain it. It was like blood was gonna start dripping from the walls any minute. Moving on to the room......This is where the magic really dies. Room color is all wrong and they carried the  we found a bunch of junk and stuck it on the walls  motif to the max in my room. Lampshade was busted! Popcorn ceilings! Cheap, ugly ceiling fan that was about a second from flying off into the abyss! Terrible mattress and pillows! I won't even get into the pool area - suffice it to say the pictures were snapped on the day it was opened.   So, what's the upside? The hotel is fun and funky. I suppose if you're a 20-something and here for the club which is from what I heard definitely happening on the weekends, this is the perfect choice for stumbling to your room at 4:00 am.

The place has a lot of character and is a refreshing change from all chain bars and casinos in town. We decided to have dinner at Mood last minute (after trying to go to Wayne's sushi, which was closed for private party. Blargh). Anyway, arrived around 8:30pm on Sat night sans reservations and were seated immediately. There were a few other groups having dinner and a piano player providing some  mood  music (yeah, i know, terrible pun...couldn't resist). The manager came over to us right away and gave us a wine list and said the server would be there in a minute with menus and to take our drink order. He was very helpful and asked what kind of wines we preferred and said he might be able to suggest something off the list. Now, at that point I wasn't really sure if I was even going have to wine and felt a little uncomfortable when he started asking our price range, but I know he was just trying to be helpful. To his credit, he brought out a bottle of red and poured some for us to try and the bf and I both liked his choice. He asked if we wanted a bottle or just 2 glasses and we said just the glasses and he poured practically a half bottle of wine into 2 glasses. I always feel sort of pressured in those situations and I hate to ask how much it is, so I just hoped when we got the bill it wasn't going to be $30 a glass or something (turned out to be $15/glass for a generous pour so I was fine with it).   As for the food, the first thing we got was the bread basket containing lavash, garlic infused sourdough (um, hello delicious warm garlicky goodness) and another type with raisins and walnuts I think--didn't try that one. We shared the Mediterranean plate to start, which had hummus, tzatziki and an eggplant dip with pita crackers. I'm a sucker for any kind of appetizer containing a trio of dips and this didn't disappoint. It was a generous portion, nicely plated and tasty. For our mains, the bf got the pork loin special and I got the swordfish. The pork dish was ridiculously huge--the bf took one of the 2 giant slabs of pork home--and came with mashed potatoes and veggies. I had a bite of the bf's pork and it was flavorful and moist, but perhaps was brined a touch too long because it was a tad on the salty side for my tastes. However, it was still good.  My swordfish was perfectly cooked and seasoned, but I do wish it had a bit more of the mango chutney with it. There was just a small spoonful of it on top. The fish came with jasmine rice and  veggies. The rice was surprisingly good (I'm not a big rice person) and I'm not really sure what was in it. It was almost like fried rice and I could swear a saw some egg in it, but I don't recall seeing that on the menu. Regardless, it was freaking yummy. The veggies were fresh and simply prepared--baby carrots, asparagus, squash.   Our server was super on top of things. My water glass was never empty, and that makes me happy.

I was looking for a cheap stay while in Vegas. This was the best deal I could find. It wasn't too far from the strip, but it was also close to where my friends are.  It is a dark artsy hotel. I guess I should have expected it since it is called the Artisan. I really was blown away by how much art there was! It was almost over crowded, but at the same time, it is fantastic for those who love classical art.  They had a bottle of wine in the room. They also have some sort of wine tasting I think I remember reading briefly, but I wasn't there at the time it was offered (I was out with my friends.) A lot of my friends are artsy and I wholly recommended this place since it fully suits their taste.  As for me- I am into that scene, but I am more city than that, so to me, it was simply too dark. They have this little bar area where you can get some food and drink, but to me, it's kinda creepy. Then again, I was alone, so it is not nearly as fun since it wasn't very busy.  I did take my time wandering in the place and checking out all of the art. It was worth it for sure since you'll be hard pressed to find such a thing anywhere else.  In all, I think this is more of a place for you to take your artsy friends to and have a blast. For those who just don't do the art thing, you'll probably feel more at home elsewhere.

This is the penultimate  only in vegas  type places. Its a boutique hotel, meaning its a hotel/bar/lounge  I've actually stayed there as a hotel so I'll break my review into two parts.  As a hotelit has a unique vibe. It comes out with a dark and sinister vibe, like Misti said, its like the haunted mansion. The lobby area has a lounge type area with books, and everywhere you go theres pictures. The elevator has a red light, so anytime I go to and from my room I always felt like it was a red light district. The floors/ rooms have a artistic vibe. Theres tons of paintings in the hallway and the rooms are all themed by an artist like Dali or Frieda. The amenities are atypical of any hotel, and the breakfast in the morning leaves much to be desired.  Now the fun part of the review is the nightclub/ after hours. this is one of the most fun clubs for locals.They  always have a good DJ, usually local, and a good variety Its free to get in, the dress code is lax and the party is never ending. Let me repeat, the party is never ending. I go there to party and I end up leaving and the sun is out.thats how wild things get, and you always lose track of time. Its also one of the places where anything can happen.  Its the kind of place where  I see a guy in a purple and green suit and thats completely normal.

Soon after we went to the bar portion of the hotel, but it was crowded and we were asked to get up from the table that we were sitting at because it was reserved for another party.

It's off the strip but as we drove to Vegas to really partake in the local restaurants we weren't concerned at all with proximity to the strip. Japanese food in Vegas is much more appealing than the slots!   The hotel staff gave us a nice quiet room on the top floor and away from the noise of the after hours bar so we had a super easy nite relaxing and puppy easily slept thru the night. If I were to comment or pre-warn visitors the hotel does overwhelmingly perfume-ize the whole floor and room so for those with sensitivities to deep musky aromas beware. We actually travel with fabreeze in tow all the time, due to puppy mostly and it served us well as I'm not a real fan of perfumes.  The decor is obviously the unique factor that presents a mood like no other and I wasn't really that bothered by the darkness as really isn't that a factor in a good nights sleep.

My next thought is that the decorator is probably an interesting person and I'd love to interview him/her if I were a psychologist.   Then I noticed how dark and loud it is in there.  There were chairs and sofas for extra comfort. The bar wasn't crowded, making the access to drinks too easy.  Hence, the result is over imbibing.  Although the place was loud, we were still able to carry on conversations without having to use my teacher trying to be heard over the chatter of 38 students voice.    Smoking was allowed in there, so I bummed a cigarette off someone who turned out to be part of a Cirque du Soleil show. Can't remember which one though. Since he's part of the show, does that mean I met a celebrity?    Anyway, if you're looking for a change of scenery, this would be a great stop.

You now need your room card to operate the elevators to go up to the floors, and you also need it to operate the lights/AC in the unit.  We liked that added security feature. Front desk/Valet staff was friendly as well, they made the whole arrival/check-out process a breeze.  What we didn't like: 1) The Mood restaurant used to be open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Now it's only open from 5pm-midnight and there really aren't any convenient places to go to get breakfast food if you just want to relax in your room and eat. 2) In our room, the sofa/love seat in front of the bed had a broken leg, and the broken leg was sticking out to the point where I tripped on it the next morning (I didn't notice it upon check-in, we were so tired we just went straight to bed.)  Apparently the staff hasn't been checking up on this because the front desk was surprised when I told them.  I would think that something that obvious would be noticeable to the cleaning crew. Also, the sink in the bathroom was wobbly to the point where it knocked into the wall while leaning against it to brush your teeth/wash your face.  Not a huge problem, but it was somewhat annoying.   3) (The major issue) All night we felt itchy and we felt like something was crawling on us in the bed, but when we would look around we wouldn't find anything.  The next morning, however, I woke up to two small roach-like insects running around on the bed. Needless to say we just grabbed our belongings and checked out. I took photos of them if management would like to see, but I won't post them. The room/hotel didn't look  dirty  even with these minor problems.  They may have come in from outside or through the window...but nonetheless it was a little unsettling.  We would continue to stay here when we come to Vegas (which isn't often) simply because of the courteous staff (our bartender was Britney and she was great) and the environment.  We ate dinner when we arrived, and the food was great, and the waiter was very attentive.  We can't complain about that experience at all. We would just like to see the rooms checked over a little more thoroughly in the future. Also, we would like to see an after-hours snack bar or even chips/soda for guests who want to purchase snacks when the restaurant isn't open.  I know the bar is open 24 hours, so maybe it could be located in there?

I've stayed at the Artisan many times in the past and used to go to the lobby bar when I lived in Vegas so I'm not unfamiliar with the property. With that said it's been a couple years since I've stayed here. I had to come through Vegas on business and it coincided with NAB so all my usual places were booked or too expensive. I usually always check the prices at the Artisan because they're reasonable and this time that was true too. I actually kinda like the property-it's super funky and weird and there's always a naughty vibe there. So it seemed like the best deal for my two nights. Upon checkin the front entrance was hidden by an  Ultra Lounge  front door setup which was really awkward to get through with suitcases etc-I almost thought they'd rebuilt the entrance but it was just a facade for the evening. At checkin I was provided a long list of things to initial including a line regarding  loud noise  and a  party  which I did without thinking because ya know....I've lived in Vegas and I've stayed here before and yeah you can hear a little background noise but it's never been bad. WRONG....the first night was what I expected, some bumps coming from the downstairs bar, the sound of rooms next door getting it on-nothing that the free porn on the TV wouldn't drown out but the second night...the night before I had to get up super early to work...the  party  was insanely loud and went from probably midnight until about 6am. It was like sleeping **in** the  party .  It seems to me that the property has greatly shifted its focus from being a hotel to being a party location. That's cool-but it should be advertised more up front. I remember the Artisan to be a dark, chill, slightly seedy place you'd take your mistress to. Now it's a 12hr electronic music festival every day. I guess if you're looking for a place to party this is the place. If you're looking for a hotel to sleep in you'd really be better off looking somewhere else. The rooms have kind of lost their gloss and honestly are a little run down and dirty. The staff however were all super nice and helpful as always. It just seems the management has taken this place in a new direction that is more party/event oriented rather than guest oriented.

The in-house bar for the Artisan hotel was way too overpriced. I mean like nine dollars a bottle of bottom shelf beer overpriced. Don't even bother with ordering shots just bring your own bottle.

Not a safe place to leave your car parked, especially if you're getting back late at night. - Unique decor, but extremely dark. Wouldn't hurt to turn on a light or two. - Only 1 elevator that takes an hour to get you to your room and down.  - Our room was not serviced after our first night. - Called front desk numerous times and could not get through and had to personally go downstairs to request for fresh towels.  - Waited an hour and still no towels. One of our girls had to shower using a dirty towel. - This place is known for their after hour club (which we were completely unaware of) and you can clearly hear the techno music from the 3rd floor pounding away. Extremely difficult to relax after a long day with all that going on.  - Bouncer was VERY rude with a extremely bad attitude and would not let us back into the hotel even after standing with us while we were waiting on our cab a few hours before.   Again, this place is known for their after hours. However, their guests (which are PAYING CUSTOMERS) cannot be forgotten and treated like S***. I will not be returning to the Artisan and I will not recommend anyone to stay the night at this hotel.", "Date": "2012-09-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Cindy", "ReviewID": "ncNsEkSC2r0qNRFbk44zdA", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Stayed here for my niece birthday weekend... it was HORRIBLE!

My husband likes the art deco, botique style hotels so the decor was right up his alley. I felt like I was in an episode of Goosebumps.. It felt desered, dark, and the front desk had an indsicriminate display of condoms and lube available for purchase. Let's also not forget the fact that we noticed several escorts operating out of there. We walked to the pool which was also deserted and disgusting. The bar charged strip prices for unsophisticated basic cocktails. An old fashioned made with Jack Daniel's? Yuck! We weren't even given an option and generally would assume it would be made with either Maker's or Knob Creek. Not at this classy joint.   I think they are on the brink of a major overhaul or being shut down. They place a $150 hold which takes several days to come off.

Yes, that's right. We all came to this hotel for our friend's wedding. Upon check in we found out that the owner of the hotel had decided to give the whole top floor to the Kardashians who had shown up, thus kicking my friends who were getting married at the Artisan out of the honeymoon suite. The Artisan put them in a regular room. They also flat out gave away several rooms that belonged to guests in the wedding party to the Kardashians so our friends had to go out to the strip on a Friday night and pay rack rate to stay somewhere else. The owner of this hotel screwed my friends and the entire hotel staff. Because the Kardashians wanted to have dinner in the one and only restaurant the hotel has, our friend's wedding reception got moved onto an outdoor patio. Did I mention it was 107 degrees? Also, the other stuff people complained about in their reviews of this hotel were true for us too. It's off the strip and cabs don't want to come here so we had to wait 45 minutes or so every time we called a cab. The key card to my room didn't work and neither did the next one we got or the next one. It got to the point where everytime we came back to the hotel we'd have to get someone from the front desk to let us in. One time we came back at 2 a.m. and had a huge man block the elevator saying he was holding it for the Kardashians. This is a 5 floor hotel with only one elevator. I don't care if Bill Clinton is there. Get out of my way and off the elevator. The owner of this hotel is greedy,unet hical and treats his staff like crap. They worked 16 hours on Sat, taking care of us, other weddings and the Kardashians. Imagine you had shown up for your wedding and found out this had been done to you. I urge you to not stay at this hotel. There is no casino there, only 1 restaurant which could be commandeered at any moment by some random celebrity and then you can't even get room service, only 1 small bar and it's off the strip and cabs won't go there so.... you end up trapped at a crappy hotel that used to be a Super 8. Yes, it was a Super 8. I hope the owner, and the Kardashians, both go bankrupt. And, if you have kids, don't go there. Pot was at the pool and cocaine was in the bathrooms. Saw it with my own eyes.

Let me be the first to tarnish its near-perfect rating with a medeocre, but unbiased review.   The Artisan isn't bad. We went on a First Friday, the night when all the arty nightcrawlers come out.  There was a generous-sized crowd there, making it rather difficult to get a drink. Luckily we knew a cocktail wench that works there and got a comped round (even though she totally burned one of our buddies and totally stole all his shit ... but that's a different review, different day). This was the first time I've ever been and I've heard friends say they've been when they were just about the only party there.   Valet is a requirement. Unless you want to park in the lot of the adjacent with the  Will tow at owner's expense  signs all over the place.   This place is like Narnia: kind of hard to find. Come from the west side of Sahara and turn right onto Highland. Otherwise, I don't know what to say.   The decor is pretty garish. They have all of these prints of Da Vinci's, Degas', Renoirs, whatever all done up in these guilded frames. Which isn't a bad thing, if it weren't for the fact that the walls were densly packed with these things.   They did some innovative things with decor, it wasn't all that bad.   The DJ was on fire, though. He was the big redeeming point about the place.   The place isn't suitable for large parties ... as there was like eight of us.   As shwag as it was, I thought it was odd that they had ESPN on the monitors.   I will give the Artisan credit for being different from the rest of Vegas. Even though it is kind of the dark side of Roccoco.   In all fairness I haven't checked out the rest of the hotel, so I couldn't give a thourough review.

The hallways are a little creepy and so is the one elevator that has red lighting inside. Cheap for $99 a night on weekends. Valet is sort of rude, we waited outside for at least 10-5 minutes and he was actually just in the corner smoking instead of doing his job. He is not as welcoming as he probably should be considering he's the first person to greet you at the hotel. I would recommended to park across the street in their  self-parking  which is just a dirt parking lot, literally dirt no concrete. Its not a far walk though, it's literally across the street saves you time to wait on the valet that's pretty slow and saves you money from tipping out the rude valet guy. The ladies st the counter were however very polite. The bus boy and housekeeping were the most courteous. We arrived at our hotel at around 5:45 pm when check in's at 4pm and our room still wasn't ready! we had to wait about 8 mins, considering the housekeeping were very polite we did not really mind. We asked for our complimentary champagne that the hotel offers you from booking on their website and house keeping was very efficient in delivery our bottle another plus! One thing I didn't like though was thst when house keeping cleans your room they do not provide you with  new soap and shampoo bottles which most hotels do. The phone in the room also did not work so we could not call for housekeeping. The lounge is open till 8 am and it does get crackkin! Not my choice of music though it more for ravers that are most likely on ecstasy, but hey it's Vegas to each is own :) You can hear the music a little bit from your hotel room , we were on the 2rd floor just one floor above the dance floor .

(Follow-up) I have been meaning to follow up on the bed bug situation. Immediately after posting my original Yelp review, I received an email and phone call from the manager, Chris. He did not apologize for the bed bugs, but instead insisted that there were none, and that we should take down our review. He said,  if you take down your Yelp review, we will reimburse you for the $250 smoking damage charge on your room.  Honestly, I did not notice that they had kept our security deposit to begin with, and sure enough when I checked my bank account, the hold was never released...I was shocked by this response and ensured him that I, and my girlfriend, are non-smokers. The manager then said,  we have videos of you guys smoking outside.  Again, I was baffled since I am a non-smoker and insisted that he send me the alleged video recordings. He did not send me any  video evidence  (Since there was none. Blackmail-fail) Instead, he said,  look, I'm going to refund you your security deposit and whatever you paid for your stay for two nights but you have to change your negative Yelp review.    Wow. Just wow. What a terrible experience.  I'm thankful for my full refund, but offended by the mistreatment and offensive accusations & bribery from the manager.

It was scary from the moment we walked into the lobby. My friend said it best,  It looks like the kind of place you see in horror movies. The kind where you go in and never come out.  I guarantee if you stay here you'll definitely want to come right back out. The elevators are spooky, and so were both of the rooms we saw. Yes, we saw two rooms because the room they originally sent us to was not ready. As in it looked as if the previous guests had left about 5 minutes prior to our arrival. It was a mess. The room we ended up staying in wasn't a whole lot better. the bathroom was disgusting (there was urine on the floor) the toilet barely worked, and the faucet handle kept coming off whenever you tried to wash your hands. Our room was right on the freeway side, so I guess it's a good view if you like looking out the window at the 15 (not to mention HEARING the 15 freeway). The staff did as little as they possibly could to resolve our issues, and the assistant manager was one of the most arrogant, condescending persons I've come across in life period, not just when it comes to hotel staff. He didnt offer so much as an apology, and was absolutely not subtle about the fact that he didn't want to be bothered with us. Our reservation was for 2 days but we checked out the morning after our 1st night there, we have no intention of going back, and want to warn any others that may consider staying at this hotel.

This review is from my stay or should I say  attempt to stay  this past weekend. Where do I start.... Let me say my wife and I discovered the Artisan about 8 years ago and have been loyal customers since. We have always raved and spoke to highly of our hidden gem to select friends, friends that would appreciate the small feel, warm hospitality and very ;) adult atmosphere. The pool experience has always been a real pleasure. We have grown so in love with the place we wanted to re-new our vows here. We plan our yearly adult getaways around the Artisan and their availability. With that said, I booked our 3 night stay this past weekend, when we arrived I was informed that we had been relocated to there sister property, Rumor, nice place but not where we plan our trip around. The front desk gentleman was very nice and attempted to contact the manager to get the matter resolved, to no avail we were told we could stay the Thursday night, with a discount but had to leave Friday and Saturday. The said they would try to have  a room on Saturday for us. So we would stay one night, be moved, then come back the third night!!! I was informed that a buyout was priority over our previously confirmed reservation. Bottom line, it did not matter that I booked before the buyout because if a company or person came after to buy out the property for an event they would get preference over loyal customers with confirmed nights booked. The buyout came after I booked my rooms but that did not matter. To add and even bigger insult, the manager who was on the phone, stated to the front desk gentleman that they had attempted to contact me via phone and EMAIL numerous times! I received no calls and no emails, Yahoo Mail doesn't lie so don't say you emailed me when it is nowhere in my inbox! I'm not sure if my dear Artisan has been bought out by someone else or new management has taken over but what a way to treat such loyal customers. Discounting my room or moving me to your other location makes nothing better. The value is obviously not on the returning clients who may only spend a few hundred dollars a night but puts these event buyout with thousands of dollars ahead of confirmed reservations. The manager never even had enough class or customer service skills to speak to me personally on the phone, not an email, not a call, nothing.

Pretty trippy when you come back to the room under the influence ;). It is not on the strip but the view from the room show cased everything there is to see. We used Lyft the entire time and the fair was around $8. Every driver had a fun and crazy story to tell us about the Artisan. There were NO bugs, NO music keeping us up all night and NO used condoms on the floor. Shower pressure was great, maid service was on point. Can't stress enough how amazing our time spent was.

My first impression upon entering it on a Saturday morning (Friday After Hours) is that this place is REALLY FUCKING NASTY.  Unfortunately, my opinion has never changed.  There are bums and hookers everywhere. The ratio runs about 10% female (9 out of 10 of those are trashy escorts), and 90% creepy dudes that didn't get some while they were clubbing from 1030 to 4:00. You can look at their faces to know that they are desperate for some affection. There is a small outside patio next to a flight of stairs where losers sit next to each other telling bullshit war stories about how  hard  they are.   You also have a really tiny room that is (the dance floor). It's like the size of a dive bar. Too many people inside, and YOU DO NOT WANT TO SIT ON THE TABLES. The hookers that took over the spot will think your a new mark and probably will try to lure you into their hotel room where a big burly guy is gonna rob you at gunpoint.   I guess for a heterosexual chick that doesn't make her living by bed hopping might find this a paradise, a farm full of semi-attractive males that only wants someone to love and care for. But for the masses of single, charming, male bachelors... you would want to try your luck at the Drai's After Hours in the Bills Gambling Hall and Casino on Flamingo & Las Vegas Blvd. It's a much better atmosphere over there, better ratio of male-to-female, and the bouncers actually give a shit about keeping the place upbeat.   I seen a couple of folks at the valet line bitch out their spouses over the phone while I was waiting for my car to come back. A lot of the creepy chomo (child molester looking) type here.   Oh, and for first-timers, you NEED to bring your car to the valet. There is no self-parking here. Come in early if you really want to come here, say about 3:30AM when the real clubs are dying down.  Update:   So I got a email saying that alot of people are putting in complaints for this review. I don't know why. I'm not slandering, i'm telling the truth of what I have experienced here. Maybe some folks like the hookers that come in here.   Well I got dragged in here one more time because one of my friends happened to have his peer host a birthday party here. Nothing fancy, just a birthday hangout. On my last visit it looks like Artisan Afterhours cleaned itself up a bit. A little bit less hookers than what I usually encounter (even though I did run into another one at the Wynn outside the Tryst Nightclub at the same day).   Seems like the crowd this time (around late-December) got less shady. The bartenders have very good visual memory of faces. I accidentally left my card at the counter, and when I came back to the bar she remembered my face and handed me back my credit card..   I didn't have a ride back home so I rented out a room. The guy at the counter cut me some slack and gave me a room for $46 + collateral ($150), usually it goes for $80. Played around with the TV, and I discovered that the TVs in here have free porn channels. Hahaha!   I managed to sleep for 3 hours, but then some random white lady keeps banging at my room's door looking for a  Allison . She won't leave me alone and I kept telling her to go away. Around 10:00AM I got into the elevator to check out and I ran into the lady again. She's a really nosey stranger, and I declined sitting next to her at the taxi stop because asked me a lot of questions about drugs and where to find them.", "Date": "2011-12-21", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "John", "ReviewID": "Jmif9lKv3prFA-yPnYgchw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Really unique.

The rate I got was $99 a night with a bottle of champagne, super cool!  The look of the hotel is super dark and almost dungeon reminiscent. My friends and I joke that it was a sex dungeon ha! Each room is a specific artist. I was in room 308, the Paul Gauguin... This room needed some severe TLC. When I walked in, it beat my expectations, but the closer I looked, I was like UM WHAT?! The nightstand had missing knobs, tons of scratches and mismatched paint on the wall, no hairdryer, HOPEFULLY clean sheets, etc. We laughed, again, because the whole point of making this hotel so dark is so you can't see all the work needed!  If you are on a major budget and can't afford to stay on the strip, this wouldn't be your worst decision. But, the music at their club was LOUD. I fully expected it to go on all night, but I am pretty sure our room was directly above the damn club. Of course, of all the rooms, we got that one. AVOID ROOM 308!

Also, the room is in disrepair; multiple items broken. They make you put down $150 security deposit. I can see why.. This place is falling apart.  Creep factor is off the charts here too.

Dust, animal hair, and hairs of other questionable origins adorn every surface as if they're part of the decor. It is said that Death Valley is the lowest point in the United States, but that's incorrect, it is actually the sagging mattress on which you're hesitant to sleep because life has been great so far without bed bug bites. If you want a sink in the bathroom that actually drains...look elsewhere. If you want a room in which the entryway light doesn't turn on and off all night long on its own, this definitely isn't the place for you.  And then let's talk about the noise. Conveniently situated above what must be a drag strip and testing facility for emergency sirens, a good night's sleep will not be had, not even with earplugs. This doesn't take into account that there's a nightclub in the lobby that opens at midnight and closes at 7am.   How this place manages a 3 star rating is beyond logic and reason. This place is basically GitMo. They could legitimately close that base and detain prisoners here and achieve the same net effect as keeping them there.

The reason why  I chose this boutique hotel, was because my husband and I were traveling to Vegas with our two dogs.  Even though most of the big hotels in LV accept dogs now, it is extremely difficult to have to walk far distances to get to the elevators, across the million of people, and the casino just to take you dogs to go potty! Good luck with that! the ARTISAN Hotel was just PERFECT!! it is only 4-5 floors high, so you can take the elevator or just simply the side stairs in be at the lobby level within a minute! There is a great area on the back, just after you pass the pool with gravel and yard, very private and you can take your dogs there for their potty time!  The staff was soooo nice, helpful and extremely accommodating!!! they are very dog friendly as the guests staying there as well, so you will feel very comfortable!! The rates are also very affordable. Some hotels will charge you an arm and a leg for a  pet fee  . Being a dog owner, I know the difficulties we go thru with our pooches all the time we travel and the staff at Artisan made our stay very relaxing! Drake at the front desk was extremely nice too!  Don't let the minor stars reviews guide you.  There is nothing sketchy about the location either.  The hotel is located right off the Sahara exit, which is conveniently located within 5 minutes to the strip! We used to live in Las Vegas, so we are very familiar to all the exits and short cuts, so for us the location was very convenient and away from the busy strip!   Give it a shot and i think you will be pleased! :)", "Date": "2012-06-14", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "iRijr58r0siL92qyM66r4w", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Totally not what I was expecting!

Not exactly what is says on the  Welcome to Las Vegas  postcards I know, yet I believe it still falls under the  What happens in Vegas...  umbrella.    I did my research on hotels and choose The Artisan bc of it's dark decadence and distance from the traditional strip. I hoped staying on their off- After Hours -nights, I'd be able to appreciate the hotel's mellower nights of sophistication as I did some writing or read 'The Vagabond' by Colette.  When I booked my reservation their website offered a selection of  add ons , of which I chose a bottle of Champagne for my arrival, and a 3pm late check-out the day of my departure.    Perhaps my expectations were too high upon arrival.  The awe and adoration for the ambiance immediately put me in a delicious mood, so I didn't imagine much could harsh my vibe.  However, I learned very quickly that when you leave the opulence of the strip, you also leave the hospitality.  I couldn't wait to get to my room, and POP open my bottle of bubbly.    *Side Note: The Elevator is AWESOME.  Feels like Twilight Zone Express.  My room was quite lovely.  Dark, ornate, esthetically pleasing.  The alarm clock flashing 12:00 needed to be set and it wasn't responding to my mild to forceful button pressing. Easy fix, unplug.  I tried to turn on the telly with the remote, but the batteries were dead.  AND WHERE'S MY CHAMPAGNE!! ...  Oh, you want it now??  the front desk asks.  YES!!!  So up comes the Champagne and batteries, both room temperature.  I guess I was expected to use the plastic cups in the empty ice bucket.  No problem.  Where's the ice machine.  HELLO??? Because warm champagne in plastic cups is SO CHIC! WTF  ARTISAN ??   Staying in to do some writing work I ordered room service.  Room service never answered the phone so the front desk told me they'd have Room Service call me back. Nice. When the food arrived, the young man making the delivery immediately starting hitting me up for a date.  Seriously? Don't do that.  I can interpret two unrequested  free refills  of OJ (that I ordered to salvage my Champagne) as sweet, but it's also very annoying & distracting.  *Suggestion: No smart phones for Valets while on duty!   Later the next evening, after an all-day  business meeting  at the Spa at The Encore (also reviewed) I was sure to confirm my late check out, anticipating it being given as much attention as my  Welcome  champagne.   It's all confirmed , I'm reassured. Mm-hmm.  The morning of my  late  check out I get a knock on the door by ...HOUSE KEEPING!!... at 9am despite the  Do Not Disturb  sign I put on my door.  I tell her kindly & sleepily that I'm not going anywhere.  10:30am, ANOTHER knock on the door by some lady with a clip board asking me if I scheduled late check-out.  YES!!  Now that I'm up and stubbornly staying put until 3pm just BECAUSE I PAID FOR LATE CHECK OUT...I decide to order room service (have I not learned?) and do some writing.   I'm going to have to wait until 11:00 to place your order and then it will be 30 min to an hour  I'm told.  Fine.  Cut to... 11:30, Room service calls informing me that due to  it being slow , the restaurant isn't going to open until 4pm.  Even when I ordered sodas as a consolation I was billed for someone else's order.    ARTISAN!!!  PAY ATTENTION!!!  You have SO much potential!! And you muck it up EVERY, step, of, the, way.  You SERIOUSLY need to invest in Customer Service & Hospitality training for your Staff & Management.  Good service galvanizes trust between an establishment and it's patrons.

It is definitely for a certain type of person I believe and that is probably why I felt compelled to write this review from that vantage point. I have read reviews for them on Hotels, and TripAdvisor and such and its a bummer that in most instances people rate them lower because of the noise. Well.... The Artisan is a cool hotel set right dab on top of an excellent After hours club. So.... in knowing that (and they definitely aren't shy about making this known) anyone looking for a place to stay in Las Vegas where they will actually need to sleep, needs to look elsewhere.  It was kind of interesting that this past weekend when we went there were complaints on the 4th floor of there being too much noise on the floor... I thought to myself that it must REALLY be bad up there if they are complaining about that over the noise coming from downstairs. I don't get it personally.... each time we have stayed here this place was more like a college dorm on the weekend rather than somewhere you honestly thought people would be sleeping. Down the hall from us there sounded like there was a DJ and an additional dance floor that the Artisan Elite were keeping to themselves, but I digress. So the review is about the hotel and not the after hours so I have to say... we dig the ambiance, spooky haunted mansion feel and even the bouncers seem to play into that as well... or maybe its just me that they seem a little menacing. There are a couple of bars in the lobby that once the club opens and gets underway, these can cause the lobby to get pretty crowded; along with the line to get into the club. My only beef with the hotel is this one thing... Back on that last wknd in January I realized after getting home that I had left my very awesome copper leather coat there. I called immediately when I realized this, which put the call going in about 25 minutes after we had left. The guy at the front desk got right on it, had the cleaning staff bring the jacket down and he himself put the jacket in lost and found for me and called to leave me a voice mail that I could come and retrieve it. Well unfortunately for me I couldn't make it back that day and ended up leaving for a couple of weeks of work. I went back this past wknd (2/26/2012) and no jacket. They did not tell me that there was a time period that my jacket could be there so I didn't feel a rush to have someone go for me and retrieve it. Hotel Lost and Found is always one of those things that I have wondered about.... where do our things really go?", "Date": "2012-02-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Tina", "ReviewID": "7W3HQU8x-DuTfHayyj-otA", "Overall": "1", "Content": "I got married here at the beginning of the year and my experience was less than pleasant. I should have known something was up when I couldn't get my wedding coordinator on the phone for weeks at a time, WEEKS. Not until I called the front desk to ask for a manager did I receive a call back from her. I was planning long distance so I had a ton of logistical questions, so again I called her 2 weeks out. It took her a week to return my call despite numerous messages and emails. When I did get a hold of her a week before my nuptials, she informed me that the AVN was having their after party there on the day of my wedding. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Was I really going to have porn stars flouncing about while I was in my wedding dress? I have a pretty good sense of humor and I laughed the situation off. Only in Vegas could pornstars be at your reception. The actual stay was awful. DON'T STAY HERE if you want any sleep. The room next to us had a huge party with a deejay in their room. How is that okay?! There's already a club downstairs! Partiers were traipsing up and down the hall, smoking, and being generally obnoxious. We had to change rooms at 2am. Did I mention that it was the night before the wedding? Deplorable.  The actual wedding ceremony was only great due to the fact that I got married. Cynthia our  wedding planner  assured me she would be there to handle everything. If handling everything means leaving stacks of ugly chairs in plain sight, messing up sound cues (3 songs people!) , and being completely rude to my wedding party and my guests, then yeah, she sure did handle everything. Our friends were in formal wear moving dirty furniture and cleaning the site for the reception because they couldn't find anyone to help. The photographer was laughably bad, the cake was miniature, and we had one waiter for the cocktail reception of 75 people. My bridesmaids and friends were opening champagne and pouring drinks for our guests.  After wards, about 25 us went on to the restaurant to eat. I told her to please have extra staff on hand because we knew we were going to be eating there. There was 1 waiter and a restaurant manager that was so rude and clearly didn't know what was going on. It took 2 hours for people to get their food. Friends told me later that their food kept coming out incorrectly and regular patrons were leaving left and right due to anger. The police even showed up to eat dinner, waited forever, walked into the kitchen to find someone, and left after no one acknowledged them for 30 minutes.  In summation, The Artisan is a joke of a hotel. It's dirty, the service is awful, and everyone there seems miserable. I'm really surprised that the place hasn't just imploded into itself.

The room was a decent size king bed room. There was damage to one of the walls in my room, so I called the front desk to be certain I wouldn't be charged. This is a party hotel booked solid with birthday parties, wedding groups, baccalaureate groups and bday groups too. In the line for checking in, there was a group of 9 girls in front on me. The lobby was all ready full with a party at 7pm, and the music was all ready bumping.   I checked out the lounge/bar/restaurant area. I sat at the bar, and a waitress tried to take my order and then the bartender stepped up and took over my order. Why the waitress would try to take my dinner order while i sat at the bar is beyond me (tips I suppose). The hamburger and fries were really tasty. The rum and coke wasn't strong at all (this was at 7pm, mind you,  before the raging party began.) Total for meal was 20 bucks.   There is no gambling machines at all in the hotel, quite refreshing. Next door is the Palace Station casino. Kind of a dump and not really worth it with a little tiny poker room. When I got back to the hotel at 1am, the party was raging. Note: There are a few strip clubs right around the corner and there were plenty of party people in the lobby to the hotel already. There had to be 150 people tripping on E. There was a little dance floor there in the restaurant area that was full of people dancing the night, and the morning away. Overall, there was a ratio of 3 guys to 2 chicks all night. The crowd was mostly, White, Persian, and Black and some Mexican.   If you are looking to sleep at all on a Saturday night, forget about it. The party down stairs, in the halls, in the lobby, and in the patio with music cranked up, celebrated until 10 am the next morning. No joke! I was hoping the hotel would provide ear plugs to muffle the noise... and in the bathroom there they were!  I only got about 3 hours sleep. The people watching is fun.

Down the street you'll find an assortment of budget hotels and strip clubs.  Hello Spearmint Rhino!

I was like  you've gotta be kidding me, this place used to be unheard of.   So I went home, changed, returned and sure enough the doormen weren't even there.  Inside the bar area is plenty of seating.  It's dimly lit with a bunch of weird art everywhere.  It's actually quite relaxing and cool.  Drinks are average price.  I think it was about 5 bucks for a beer.  The local hipsters have discovered this place so you're gonna have to deal with that.  Parking is non-existent unless you want to do valet.

I would not stay again.  The room was clean, there was free wifi, the bed was really comfortable, there was free continental breakfast, and the food was good. But when we got to our room, there were a few things wrong. The toilet paper roll in the bathroom was almost empty and there were no replacements. The temperature in the room was incredibly hot and the thermostat didn't work. The sprinkler head on the ceiling was coated with such a thick layer of dust that it probably wouldn't work for an actual fire.   I called the front desk to ask for more TP and to fix the thermostat. When someone picked up, I said,  Hi, I'm in room 405,  and before I could finish the sentence the woman working says,  Okay...???  as if I was annoying her or something by calling. They eventually sent up a very nice guy to show me how to control the temperature (it was on the actual unit by the window).   We were warned that there was an after hours club in the lobby that night. My boyfriend and I were exhausted after flying all day from CT and I just wanted to sleep. The bass was thumping all night long until 8AM!!!!! It was insane. When I went to the front desk to ask for earplugs, I was told they had run out.   I was hoping to get some sleep the next day, but there was a huge pool party outside and the bass thumping there was even louder than the nightclub. I basically got zero sleep the whole trip.  When my boyfriend and I wanted to rent a car, we asked the front desk if they could help us find a nearby rental car agency and the response was,  Um... I could Google it or something... . I told her I'd Google it myself.  Other than that, though, most of the hotel staff were very friendly. The valet parking was a great feature. The decorations were neat and the lighting/atmosphere were cool. The area where the wedding was held and the reception were beautiful and the food there was good. The bartender at the wedding reception was pretty rude but she poured heavy.

But it wasn't unbearable since we already read the reviews before even booking this hotel (can't beat the good  week rate  price). We requested a refrigerator (they only accept cash because it's provided by another company and not through the hotel). The hotel told us that they'll come by to pick up the fridge in 2 days however, come 2 days and still no one came by. When we checked out 2 days later, the bill showed that we owed them extra costs for keeping the fridge. We informed them about the situation and the manager took the additional days off of the fridge rental bill since it was on their end that no one came by to pick it up.

Every inch of the walls (in the lobby, in the hallways, and in the rooms) were full of very bizarre artwork.  6.  The whole place smelled on talcum powder.  Very strange.  7.  Their idea of self-parking was an abandoned dirt lot across the street, with a lot of cars to dodge while crossing the street.  Don't be surprised if your car gets  broken into if you park here.  8.

I made it very clear that because i live in orange county, i was very open to suggestions/recommendations with vendors.   thursday.  we had been exchanging emails about rehearsal times for the past 2 weeks.. she called me welcoming me which was very nice. also she wanted to confirm our 6pm rehearsal time... well our rehearsal time was for 630 which is stated in our emails. side note- i am completely stressed out at this point.. we still had to get our marriage license and meet with the dj..  anyway i told her no its at 630 and she said she had another appointment and  would try to figure it out..  then later texts me back to say sorry because she dbl checked her email and i was right! duh! why are you adding stress to this day.. you are supposed to be making it easier! many things like this happened.   anyway so the rest of the evening went pretty well... heather was a lil frustrated because most of the wedding party was buzzed and it was hard to get people to shut up.. but hey its vegas! anyway.. so it was told to me that we could use the iPod hook up outside for the ceremony.. micheal (manager?)  was in charge of hitting next and fading out music during the ceremony... the plug in for iPod was super sensitive and kept making the music cut out.. after the 4th time running through we got it all figured out and he said if we used an ipad we wouldn't have these problems because it could sit on the table..done i did that assuming it would be perfect... lets just say on the day of we got through the forst 3 songs easy and when the last song that needed to play as we walked out after our vows.. iit skipped and went quiet for like 15-20 seconds while we stood up at the alter.. totally awkward. remind me how hard it is to press play? k fast forward to rehearsal.. i talk to heather & michael.. i find out heather will only be by the wedding for a couple minutes.. she is putting someone i have never met in charge of my entire wedding.. and basically this poor lady has to only go by a sheet of paper heather has drawn up for her. refer back to rehearsal time mistake and so many more little mistakes like spelling my first/last name wrong on official contracts.. i mean im paying you guys over $15,000 and pretty much sold out your hotel... can u spell my name right?   wedding day! so she brings the ipad down to have pre ceremony music.  we head downstairs which she walked us down to make sure we didnt run into the guys.. think thats the last time i saw her. after the ceremony is when i lost my shit. were in the lobby taking pictures &i keep seeing all the guests running to the main bar when there is a bar in the reception area that we payed for (soft bar) 3 hours. it shoud have started right away for cocktail hour!  i stressed to heather over all those months that i wanted the guests ushered into the reception area to take photos& get drinks! well there was no structure whatsoever because this chick that was  running  my wedding had no clue what was going on! on top of that... they only had a cash bar so everyone was running to the main bar to get their drinks (where they all had been hanging out the whole weekend!$$$) because no one told them where to go! also a friend of mine put 500 bucks toward the bar because they were charging people! ps.. it was 35 bucks a person for 3 hours plus a 29.1 percent tax/gratuity... also i have friends that do not drink and we still had to pay for them as drinkers including his lil sister who is only 19. another quick side note.. they dont have non alcoholic beer so i went and bought some to put behind the bar... no idea if they charged my friends for those but i wouldnt be surprised since its completely unorganized.   1 more thing..  a mnth before the wedding we had a tasting with heather that went great.. during this time i asked her about saturday night in the masterpiece suite because wanted to book it. she said it was available & got me the discounted rate for $249  so i booked the room after the tasting which came to $290.00. we partyed pretty late in the afterhours downstairs after wedding..it was about 11am when i heard a knock on our door the morning after our wedding. the maid asked me if i was checking out.. i said no i booked for another night.she said ok &got on her walky talky.. i  started getting ready for the pool party  about 40 minutes later, another knock on the door &its 2 security guys. one  guy said wehe said they were told i had  refused to leave the room  and needed to move across the hall asap! wtf! so we had to move ALL of our wedding stuff (dress,gifts,luggage) with 30 friends waiting in lobby. we were pissed.", "Date": "2013-09-26", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Paolo", "ReviewID": "GKy18380ML2-bnsMB9dSDg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I've never actually stayed here; we just dropped in for the bar after hours.

They had Walking Dead on their Flat Screens and 80's ballads for music. Whatever happened to the nice trance loungey music that they used to play? People used to dress up and hangout.

There were two of us and not even enough towels for one person when we got here.  There are no refridgerators in standard rooms, so don't plan on keeping drinks or food in the room.  There were only two pillows on the bed, both of the same firmness but of two different sizes. So there need to be more options here or an actual, matching set.  As I mentioned before, there were problems with the bathroom. The sink faucet is not secured properly to the sink and moves the entire piece around IF you can manage to turn the water on as both handles barely move. With both the sink and shower, if you can get these to function, there is very little water pressure.  The ceiling fan when operating shakes like a 9.0 earthquake is happening.

We tried ordering more beer  (mind you it was a Saturday night) and before their happy hour ended but I don't know if they purposely didn't have a bartender there or what but she came back right after the 7 o'clock mark so we just closed our tab.   The decor was cute but our room was on the side of the patio and they have EDM music going ALL NIGHT. There was a party at the hotel called after hours and they had music going from the night up until 7 in the morning. Pillows were uncomfortable but I had it over my head most nights.   Very thin walls, I could hear the people next door talking. But it's not all that bad...  We ordered food from Barcelona downstairs and they were really nice. We ordered over the phone and went down to pick up the food and it was good. $30 and could have been split between 3 people. $7 for an uber to and from the hotel to Wynn, not too bad.

What an interesting Hotel.  This is not your father's hotel on the strip.  We stayed on a Friday and Saturday night.  We chose the Artisan because our Alumni group was having a party at the bar.  I shall divide the review into two parts.  The Bar:  The Bar is open 24 hours and also has food available late into the evening.  Our party was fantastic.  Great music, awesome food and super drinks.  The next day after the party we received a report from our friend who came back to the hotel at about 3 am.  He was amazed by the line out the door and around the block to get into the bar.  He was finally allowed through the velvet ropes and up to his room after showing his room key.  When this place claims it is the number one after hours bar, it appears that the claim is true!  The Hotel:  When you walk into the lobby you are greeted by all sorts of art.  Art on the ceiling, art on the walls, art on the floor.  Unbelievable. Fun is the word that comes to mind.  We stayed in the Picasso suite on the fourth floor.  It was comfortable and roomy.  It did have some quirks like the carpet wasn't quite perfect on the floor; however, there was good water pressure and a comfy bed.  That said, our room overlooked the expressway on ramp and was, at times, extremely noisy.  Plus, in the evenings, you could hear the thumping of the music from somewhere on the property. But heck, this is Vegas.  Who needs to sleep anyway?  The Pool:  Unfortunately wasn't really open yet as we were there in March.  But it had a nice layout and looked like a place I could relax.    The Service:  I really liked that food and drink were available just about 24/7.  A nice feature.  One downside was that since this is off the strip, getting a taxi can take a little time.  Walking from here anywhere was really not an option.    That said, we enjoyed our stay and felt we received good value for the money.  Under the right circumstances we would certainly stay here again.

I'm moving into the area in a few weeks and everyone who works here is super kind. I didn't take advantage of the club or very much time in the pool, but it's been DEAD. No people in the club at all. I'm not sure if it's because of the off season in Vegas, but for people mentioning how thin the walls are (which they are) it's been dead. Which I like. This place is rustic and retro. Still need to have some improvements.  If you are staying in room 423 and there is a small coffee stain the size of a pea in the upper left hand side of the sheets, then the sheets haven't been changed since before I got here.

Being vibrated by a pumping bass for 8 hours as you lay peacefully in bed until 8am is only an added bonus!  How did they know club music is like an adult version of a lullaby?   Also, the hallways and walls are littered with 18th century artwork and earlier. I'm pretty sure they're the originals.

Very cool decor, and clearly it's a place to be seen as far as nightlife is concerned.  My terrible experience however, relates to their service as a hotel rather than as a nightclub.  It would definitely seem that they are less focused on the former than latter.  (My wife and I are in our 20's, and pretty open-minded to any experience.  We're also Vegas locals, and have stayed at several places up and down the Strip, if that makes any difference.)  We checked into our room in the around 5pm, and the room was adequate.  Cozy with very cool decor, but nothing fantastic.  We left the place to eat dinner and see a show elsewhere, and when we came back around midnight, the party was in full-swing.  We had to show our room keys just to bypass the nightclub line that had formed in front of the hotel... no big deal.  We went to the bar, had a couple drinks, a smoke, and decided to turn in... apparently this was our mistake.  Around 5am, we were awoken to a party in our 5th floor hallway.  This is beyond the control of the hotel if no one reports, so I called the front desk.  A really uninterested guy answered the phone to take my complaint.  He promised to send security up to check it out.   Meanwhile, the party gets louder, they begin smoking in the hallway which comes right under the door and right through the vents into the room, and they are calling their friends in the club downstairs to join them at the top of the 5th floor elevator.    I wait 10 minutes for this all to be handled by security... nothing.  I call downstairs again and am told that security would be up shortly.  10 more minutes and no change.  I call a 3rd time, and am told by the same guy that they've been sent and he offers to move me to another room.  Now, I appreciate the concession, but the offer is somewhat insulting... my wife and i are going to pack up our entire room, change out of our pajamas, walk through the party in the hallway, and settle into a new room at at 5am?  No thanks.    So I open the door to find security ... who has finally arrived, but instead of breaking up the party, they only ask them to take it to their room, where they proceed to pump techno music ad nauseum so that entire hallway sounds like a rave.  There was no sleep to be had.  Being locals, we did decide to pack up all of our things and change into our regular clothes, but we just walked out and went home.  Night ruined.

It's what I imagine a hipster bar in Hollywood would be like (if I ever drove the 40 miles to Hollywood) with the added bonus of NOT being in Hollywood! The people there seem down-to-earth and not pretentious. The music on the Saturday we went was awesome -- a DJ spinning trippy, loungy, cool electronic music (a refreshing break from the throbbing club music of our previous nights at clubs on the Strip).  The martinis are pricey at $14 but exotic and worth it. I wish I could remember what mine was, but it was purpley-pink and delish. I was tempted to get the absynthe one, but lost my nerve!

First of all we had a Complimentary breakfast (which was great) but we made the mistake of ordering coffee, it was $5 for a cup of coffee!!! Usually that wouldn't bother me but the coffee was DISGUSTING..cold..stale etc, and none of us drank more than a few sips!!  When we spoke to the manager about it he basically said  I DON'T CARE, WE HAVE TO MAKE MONEY  I was in shock at the lack of compassion sarcasm and rudeness. Considering we are staying at a hotel that is worse than Circus Circus you would think they would be more accommodating so they can keep the few guests they have.   Then while my friend is taking a shower the ceiling starts leaking, and not just water but some brown stuff. We called downstairs and they had someone up immediately who told us that there were two guests upstairs taking a shower together!! You could imagine our disgust! We called downstairs bc we wanted another room they told us  NO, WE ARE BOOKED  but the funny thing is there were 5 rooms on our floor that were empty our entire stay! The maintenance man fixed the leak but not before I saw MOLD!!!!! Normally I would have ran out the room and never turned back, but my friends reminded me that if they weren't gonna give us our $5 back for our disgusting coffee, did I think they would give us money back for our stay??   The pool was nice but I would compare it to an apartment pool. Cabanas were first come first serve on Friday which was nice.  Our room key hardly ever worked which caused us to have to go downstairs multiple times  There is no ice machine so again you have to go down to the bar to get ice  Drinks were pretty expensive. Don't get me wrong I know its Las Vegas, but usually the lower starred hotels offer cheaper drinks and/or food. I felt like we were charged a Venetian price but staying at Motel 6.   Bottom line is this hotel in my opinion is a 1 or 2 star and the service is exactly that, but the price was the same as some of the hotels on the strip but we would have gotten a better location and better service.

PROS: ~The bed was soft and comfortable. ~The sliders we had at the restaurant were good for an evening snack.  ~The decor in the lobby is absolutely beautiful.

Go upstairs and forget about the pool. The rooms have some cool looking art, but to be honest when I've been in the rooms I wasn't paying close attention to details to be able to write an in-depth review of them.   In short this review is going to mainly reflect I've been there several times and having avoided many of the amenities that people claim to go there for I've enjoyed the experiences immensely. Two things to watch out for. 1: Drink pricing is ridiculous if you check out the bar. 2: Use the valet as self parking will have you worrying about your car vs. enjoying why you came here.

It's been extremely difficult. There was an issue wheere they actually took the credit amount of out of the bank account then put it back in, causing an overdraft fee.   When I called to let them know, they said  well, you'll have to deal with the bank on the overdraft fee and we'll try to issue the refund again.   Two weeks later: no refund.   They won't give me an option to issue the refund on a different card that was used for the actual hotel room and they really haven't done much except pretty much say  oh, my bad  multiple times.   You can sound as apologetic as you want to but if you're not resolving the matter then what's the point?  I'm sick and tired of this place.   DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!!!!!! The customer service is awful - there's no consideration for the inconvenience and apparently, any promises of resolution are not carried out.   I originally posted three stars because I figured, at least they're trying to help the situation by issuing a credit for one of the days. But now, it just seems like they were saying that just to placate me.   I feel like they're just waiting for me to give up on the credit.

I reserved our room a few months in advance and was told that we would have a Jacuzzi tub in our room and that there were plenty of mirrors in the room (which was a selling point for our wedding night). I even confirmed this with the concierge on the phone 3 times in the same conversation before I paid the full reservation fee.   We get there and nothing was at all what I had expected for our wedding night. I called the front desk and they said the person that I spoke with has been working there for years and there is no way he would have said that there was a Jacuzzi in the room and that is had big mirrors everywhere. Front desk said he would talk with his manager and get back to us. Also the complimentary champagne was also not available and when I ended having to call back he said he can't get a hold of his manager and he has to ask him if we can also have our champagne (which later we got a drink ticket for).     I finally call the front desk again for the third time and he still hasn't spoken to his manager, he said that he can knock off the resort fees for us and we can check out the next day (instead of staying the 3 nights we paid for). We said it is just easier to stay here and took the resort fees as being discounted as a plus.   NEXT DAY, Our wedding day. We wake up to a phone call at 9 am which we had missed. We fell back to sleep for an hour and then woke up to start getting ready for our wedding. I go into the bathroom to wash my face and start applying my wedding make up. Unfortunately when I went to turn the water on  to rinse my face of soap the water would not come on. We called the front desk and explained we have our wedding to get ready for. They said they would let us check out of the hotel, that the water would not be back on for 2 hours and that we didn't have to pay the resort fees. We ended up canceling my hair appointment at the hotel for the wedding up-do and  the water came on an hour later. We stayed at the hotel and later that night our friend who was at the wedding got us a hotel at the Encore for a wedding present (which was amazing by the way)! We ended up still paying the full price for the hotel at the Artisan even though we didn't stay there the last two nights.    The Artisan is a swingers hotel, it is dark and to some extent it is creepy there. They advertise that they are a restaurant but they don't serve food because they don't actually have a restaurant (even though their sign outside is illuminated with the word restaurant on it). They also advertise that they are super busy and have lots of people there having fun but no one is there at all. The bar was empty it was just awkward being there the entire time.   All in all, our wedding was amazing because we love having fun and we had 30 people fly into Vegas from all over the country for our wedding (and we had an amazing time in Vegas with them excluding this hotel completely). This makes for a good part to our story but totally was not worth the stress it caused us and I want to make sure that no one ever stays here on their wedding because it is not at all what is advertised. Also they say you cant bring children here and there was children there as we were checking out our last day. I don't know who would bring their children here, seriously it is very strange for parents to bring their kids to a swingers hotel.   Also this is far from the Vegas Strip and it is not in walking distance.

The one issue I have with the Artisan - and it's a big one - is that the  dancefloor  is also the thoroughfare to get from pretty much anywhere in the building to anywhere else in the building. So you can't dance without people having to walk around you, and you have to walk across the dance floor whenever you want to move anywhere.

They finally had to tape something white to it. *The Pool was a joke, small and it got so hot we had to get out because it was like a sauna.  *It's a rip off, you have to rent a cabana($500-$750) or a lounge(~$250)- or else you're in the pool or sitting on the hot cement.

How Excited I was to be able to book a room there this past Saturday. How pretty the pictures were. Topless pool. Ultralounge! The list goes on.  What we actually got: 1. Nice Valet guy. 2. Nice registration clerk, smiley and helpful. 3. Only 1 elevator.  4. Extremely dark lobby and hallway to the point of being spooky. 5. Very small but cute room. To note that every room features different artists, mine was Roy Lichtenstein room 325. 6. Everything was clean but the bathroom was missing essentials e.g. soap, shampoo, lotion. No biggy, I brought my own. What I did not bring was the blowdryer for my hair. Neither the bathroom had it. So airdry it is. 7. Free porn. Hmmmmmm, what kind of hotel is this? Looks classy but now I'm thinking a Brothel. 8. After dropping our bags we are heading to the famous lounge and see the pool area. When we got to the elevator 2 people that wearing the Hotels  uniform are standing there waiting. They do not greet us. Ok. No biggy. We assume, big mistake, that they are heading down. They dont ask us where we are going, they just kind of blocked our view of the call buttons. When the elevator finally after full 5 minutes gets there it is apparentely going UP! Oops. Inside there was another guy that works there, tall, blond, wearing glasses, sorry I dont have the name, invites us in to ride up with him instead of just waiting again. Very nice guy. We go in and take the ride. On the way back down of course we stop at our original 3rd floor and those two people still there but talking to someone and dont let go of the elevator, just holding it up basically. We are still OK but getting kind of irritated.  9. The lounge is very very nice. Beautiful art everywhere including the ceiling. Lots to see. The bartender was friendly and fast. Drinks decently priced 10. A  girl wearing a bathing suit walked in to the bar. It looked ridiculous! How is anyone allowed inside being almost naked and dripping water? Fail! 11. We went back to our room to get ready to go out. I was naked when I heard someone just outside the door, then that someone put the cardkey in, I'm thinking Wrong room, the door wont open, they will realize it and it will be over. Big mistake! The door was actually unlocked and started to open when I screamed to stop. I grabbed the towel and looked out just to find a girl that works there( just to say that it was one of the people by the elevator earlier) just walking away. I asked her if she needed anything, her reply was, verbatim, I got the wrong room . WTF? How about knocking?  12. We left for the evening. Came back around 5am and saw extremely drunk girl standing up on all fours and throwing up in the bushes. Really? Boutique Hotel? The lobby is packed with people, loud music, party is going on full blast! Very cute doorman.  We actually had no problem falling asleep with all the commotion going outside.

The lounge area was next to the bar and across from the DJ. Like I said, it's not terribly large, and I could barely hear my friend sitting right next to me. I'm sure I sound old, and it made me feel old, but I like good music and I like it loud, but it was not good music so maybe that's why it seemed so loud.  The patio outside is nice. I liked that. That would be where I'd rather hang out. The music is still loud, but the good loud. The way it's supposed to be. It was a bit chilly outside but it was cozy. There is seating and tree's and tables.

I picked this place since it had a topless pool and the rate was astonishingly good and I love boutique hotels.  I took a cab from the airport and it came to about $25(?) with tip. The hotel is quite a ways from the strip and there is not much around it except for Shari's Cabaret. I heard there's a huge strip club nearby too but I didn't see it.  It felt isolated but I found it kind of nice that way since I knew I was going to be in the thick of things the next day.    It is really dark in the lobby just like how all the other reviews say.  Like the Haunted Mansion from Disneyland.  I had to wait a few minutes before the front desk agent appeared but I used the time to look at all the paintings and art in the lobby.  There's lots to see. There was no one around. At all. It was, after all, only 1:30 on a Wednesday. This place is known for their after parties on the weekend and it was definitely not the weekend.  The agent emerged from the back room and told me that I probably couldn't check in til about 3:15.  Check in is usually at 4. I expected that so I made sure to pack my bikini in my carry on and changed in the bathroom.  When I returned to the front desk to ask directions to the pool, the agent asked me for my driver's license and credit card, checked me in early, AND gave me a complimentary bottle of champagne.  Love her!   The room was average sized and the bed was comfy. Two complimentary bottles of water were in the room as well as free porn (channel 69 ha ha!). lol.  Ice was to be picked up from the bar in the lobby. The water turned cold mid-shower the following morning and the blow dryer was noticeably broken but I had such a good time during my stay there (combination of the company I met and the really cool, quirky hotel) that it didn't phase me.  I wasn't in my room for most of the night (and who is anyways?) but when I was, I could hear lots of people going in and out of their rooms.  What fun! lol  I could see the pool area being a fun place to hang out once people are there.  When I got down to the pool, I was the only one.  Talk about  me  time. lol!  It was great!  I'm older (pushing 40 BUT still semi-hip) so I don't mind not being in the middle of things. The weather didn't really cooperate though.  Stupid clouds.  I did get a little sun minus annoying tan lines :-) The only people that I saw in the pool area were employees that were discussing arrangements for a wedding with a client. And then I met a boy. Oh yes! Let me just say that even though I stayed at a five star resort and received VIP treatment the following night, I had a better time staying at the Artisan hanging out with JT ;-)  Yes, you are away from the strip and yes, you do have to wait at least 10-15 minutes for a cab (you do anyways when you're in a long ass taxi line), but it is a great deal (came to about $80 with tax on a WEEKDAY) and you can go topless without the crowds ;-) I'm up here quite a few times during the year for work and and I will definitely be flying in a day earlier just to stay here.

I was able to get a Priceline deal.    At check-in I signed an acknowledgement form pertaining to the noise level.  They verbally notified me that, because of Friday and Saturday night parties that are held until 7am the next morning, noise levels might be a nuisance for guests.  I stayed on the 4th floor in a corner facing the freeway during my visit.  Honestly, the noise from the DJ's music only sounded like distant bass noise.  And the freeway / street traffic noise was something I'm used to.  But guests who prefer a solemn atmosphere should know these are adverse factors.  The best and most interesting part of my stay was all the artwork from the lobby to hallways and rooms.  All replicas of famous paintings.  Romantic era beauties, and reminded me of an historic castle.  For some its eerie and dark.  My opinion, it was antiquely cool.    I hadn't a chance to attend the weekend parties but their small parking lot does get packed.  Its valet only, so don't forget your dolla bills if you're staying.  And the attendant might be different during day and evening.    Rooms are basic with a bed, side chair, desk/vanity, shower head tub bathroom - no jacuzzi or anything.  I don't know if there are other types of rooms; you'll have to check their website or call.    The room I had was dusty though: headboard, side table, window shutters... I thought two things - eeeuuu gross dude and oh kinda goes with the theme.  That's why I'm giving this a 3 rating neutral.  Location is close to main road and freeway access to wherever so that's a plus; except that I had to drive around to make a U-turn in order to get on the right direction.  I'd stay here again since I tolerate the experience and it was affordable for a short visit.

The atmosphere was unlike anything we have experienced in Vegas, but it was the staff who made it special for us, always taking the time to make sure we were having fun and had what we needed.    The parties did go late on the weekend, and the hotel is far from soundproofed, so anyone expecting to be able to go to sleep in the late evening or early morning in  silence might want to choose from one of hundred other hotels within a ten minute taxi drive.  But the Artisan doesn't claim to be anything it's not, and fair warning is given, so there should be no surprises.  Our solution to the noise - after a great Saturday couples pool party wound down around six, we slept until midnight when the music came on again,. We left the hotel for a few hours, but came back to continue the party because that was more fun than anything else we had done so far that night, and went to sleep again when they shut it down five hours later (a little earlier than usual, apparently, but it was raining).    The hotel is lifestyle-friendly without being overt about it (we're pretty low-key people so it was nice that aspect was fully acknowledged but still treated with subtlety).    And it was a great atmosphere for the missus to push the boundaries with her evening clothing without needing to be concerned about being harassed.  During the daytime, she enjoyed being able to swim and walk around topless at the pool.  We had a problem with the door getting stuck, and the maintenance guy, who was staying in the room across the hall that night, told me it could be repaired in the morning.  He knew we would be out late, but even so told us that if we had any problems getting in, we could knock on his door at any hour and he would give us a hand.  That meant a lot to us.  It's indicative of the friendliness and service provided by every member of the staff we met in five days / four nights.  It's not luxury, it's a decent but aging hotel.

It is the walkway between the main huge room, which sits unused, and the outside smoking patio.) Everyone gets there and we wait. And wait. And wait. People start chanting  Contest! Contest!

If you read the reviews you're going to question staying here but do yourself a favor and silence the mental chatter and just book a night anyway.

We stayed here during the week so there wasn't much of that going on (that we could tell/hear).  - Channel 69 is free and it's not one of those channels that show infomercials on repeat.. - Complimentary valet parking so bring yo dolla dolla bills, yo. - Pool area is small but they have killer lounge beds and it's topless optional (which may be a selling point for you). They close at 7 but as long as you're not making a ruckus, I hear it's not uncommon for them to keep it open a bit later.. it helps if you keep ordering drinks from the bar.  - No ice machines so you'll have to rely on your bartender to hook you up.  - 18+, no kids allowed.

Ps - i am again stuck in the lobby right now because the elevator key again will not take me upstairs. 90% of the time that i have attempted to go upstairs in the elevator i needed to go get a new card key that still would not always work.

The drinks are pretty expensive, $ 12 for vodka and soda, but that's Vegas. The bartenders are cool, considering everyone's state of mind at 6am. Security is chill, just don't act a fool.

I recently stayed here and decided to give it three stars for a few reasons...  First, rating the hotel itself. They make it known from the get go that this is a party hotel. More specifically, it's a swingers paradise. So, as we were informed, the noise level is pretty crazy. Some rooms get the bass from the pool and after hours bar pretty bad. The latter of which stays open until 8 AM on the weekends! We also heard parties and really loud sex coming from tons of the rooms.  If you're reading this you probably already know about the wild decor of this place. It looks like the haunted mansion at Disney with an adult theme. The hallways and rooms also look like they're straight out of a horror movie. The rooms are pretty bad, to be quite honest. The handles were torn off the dresser/nightstand, the tv's volume didn't work, the beds had no blankets (only two sheets) and one of our beds had red stains and pieces of rice in it. Pretty awful. But again, you're probably coming here to party and hookup. So what exactly are you expecting?  The pool was cool and small. It's top-optional as well, not unexpected. We were kicked out for a couples party on a Saturday though, unless we paid to stay. That kind of sucked. I peeked at the party later and it looked like it was getting pretty wild.  The after hours bar is pretty great here. It really doesn't pick up until after 2AM, but then it gets packed and wild. It's actually a lot of fun. However we came down twice over our weekend to try and get some day drinks, but left after about 15 minutes when the bartender was no where to be found.  As I mentioned before, you're coming here for the party, not for world class treatment. Are some of the issues with the rooms unacceptable? Absolutely. But there aren't many places with this sort of scene, so you kind of have to put up with it if you're dead set on having a wild weekend.", "Date": "2016-08-14", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Hannah", "ReviewID": "m_EJrCAN3HeNnHYwl1wd0Q", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I've been here a couple of times when I visit Vegas and I love it.

If you are on a serious budget, it's not the worst, but rethink sleeping on fri, sat and some sundays. I had a serious discount here, so price-wise it was incredibly inexpensive for the week. I was a zombie Sat and Sunday from minimal sleep though ( due to noise level)  Transportation without a car can be trying.

Tried going here with two of my buddies for a few drinks last night. Was turned away at the door. No flip-flops they say.   First they were black leather sandals.   Second why does this not apply to girls, as we walked away we saw a group head over. One had on flip-flops, we said let's see what happens, they all walked right in. Now these girls weren't dressed slutty, and they were not super model attractive. Normal people.   Third I have been here a few times in the past and they didn't have a dress code. It was a really great place for locals to hang out. Very unique lobby / bar / lounge, with all the paintings on walls and ceiling. It just has that I'm cool atmosphere. Seems its so great though they can afford to choose whose money they want and turn people away.    So if you're looking for a place where you gotta dress the part and look cool, head on over.

If you look at the photos they lead you to think this is a cool hotel for any one, it is not.  The Artisan hotel is so far off the beaten path that it is next to impossible to get a cab to go anywhere during the hours of 7AM to 1AM. at 3AM this place is jumping with music and people getting there party on. if afterhours party is what you are in need of this is the place.   The frontdesk staff can only tell you what they can not do for you, if you ask for a receipt showing $0.00 for incidentals, they told me no hotel does that, and they have been in the hotel business for 15 year and I do not know what I am talking about as a traveler.  Not Guest friendly at all they are like Free Range Chickens, they do and say whatever they want, there is no common guest service montra.  Perfect for a club.  I do not say stay away, but I will say,   keep your expectations low.   Party in the front no business in the back.

It's dark, it's lush, and floor to ceiling covered with art reprints (or mirrors, in the case of the ceiling).  Most newbies to the Artisan probably get lost on the approach.  It's in the armpit of Sahara and the 15 (on the SE corner) and takes a couple of sharp right turns to actually get into the place.  Upon first arrival it appears that valet (free) is the only parking option, but if you drive past the  driveway  there is a parking lot down and on the right.  When you walk into the hotel you notice dark, rich colors and the walls are covered with reprints of famous art.  There are cushy chairs arranged around book nooks, which I take advantage of for a refuge from the noise of the club.  I think the loudness of the music is my only real complaint - I think over the last four years that I've been visiting the DJ's have become more mainstream (not necessarily a good thing in my opinion) and the music has become louder - to the point where you have to yell to your friends.  That said, I still go occasionally for the decor and people watching.  The lounge mimics the hotel lobby where there are art prints blanketing the walls and skirt onto the ceiling which they share with framed mirrors.  Friday and Saturdays they have a DJ that plays dance hits mixed with electronica.  If you hit the club early enough you can partake in the couches around the periphery of the club, and I advise checking out their little grotto area, especially if you have a small group.  Drinks ain't cheap, but they're no strip prices either (~$8 for a mixed drink).  I think it's a happy medium for what the place offers.  If you want a break from the strip, but the feel of a club with a more creative and interesting decor, this is the place.  To just enjoy the atmosphere and actually be able to chat with your buddies, avoid Friday and Saturday nights.  I think every Vegas local should check it out at least once, and it's a great example for out-of-town friends to see that Vegas can be more interesting and unique than what is offered on the strip.  I can see this place existing in a town like Portland or Seattle.  side note: I found the restaurant in the hotel completely mediocre, but have only been once.", "Date": "2010-11-21", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Elizabeth", "ReviewID": "OQz2E8PSxV2zhJGjvZO6VA", "Overall": "1", "Content": "DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU PLAN ON SLEEPING  What initially drew me to this hotel was the great location (not on the strip), the great decor (which it does have), and the price was right (got it for 89.99 a night on a weekend).

The carpet is so old and worn out it is ripped up in some places- UGH. I wore shoes ALWAYS- the carpet looked really dirty!!! You could see where someone had punched holes in the walls- and then maintenance repaired, but not very well. The bathrooms are BAD. No place to hang your towel- or put anything!!! No shelves- No place to put anything!! If you're lucky you get one teeny bar of soap. And maybe a towel. Tub looked dirty and water constantly leaked from the faucet. Ceiling in the bathroom looked like it had some MAJOR repair work done- but was so obvious. Our room had a window looking out onto I 15. Wow- what a view. And constant traffic noise 24/7. Could hardly sleep with the police sirens and loud car and truck noise. Old television- old, worn out and stained furniture- really - a nightmare. Door to our room was obviously tampered with in the past. Holes and marks near the lock- could see out into the hallway the crack between the door and frame was so big. Elevator feels like it will need service sometime very soon as it is so old. Scary. The service in the bar was horrible! Asked for a Mojito- well, they didn't have any limes so had to make my drink with lemon. What? A Mojito with lemon!!!! No way!! And bartender seemed constantly bothered by any requests. Seemed too much trouble to honor any requests for drinks- in fact I heard a person ask for a standard drink called an  old fashion - but couldn't get it because they had no oranges!! Prices for drinks are outrageous. Pool area is also deteriorating. Pillows and cushions all are stained and super old. Bases for sunbathing platforms are all falling apart.  I have a feeling this place is headed for mucho trouble. Hardly anyone else staying in the rooms (that I could tell)- and never anyone in the bar area.

The ceiling in the bar is filled with gorgeously framed mirrors to open up the room & give a magical touch.   The DJs during the club sessions are phenomenal & dedicated. If this hotel is sold out, go just for the club it is SO FUN! & there's a great out door area to get some air. The pool is fun too, sometimes the hotel puts on fun community events there. Come on locals, this is definitely the place to be on the weekends!!!  One thing about staying in a room on the weekend is you here the music all night if you're trying to sleep, so if you feel like dancing it's great--but it's not really a place to just relax on Friday/Saturday night.   The valet parking is cool too, & I feel like I'm back in Hollywood going to Sur with the pretty strong lights out front.   Surrounding areas, however, are pretty sketchy/not that close to the strip so be prepared to Uber or drive if here. The view of the strip from the rooms are absolutely gorgeous though.   I would definitely come back here. It's like home to me. The only reason why I don't give 5 stars is because not all customer service was like the one receptionist that made us feel at home...some of them are a little apathetic. & I can't guarantee you a good night sleep either.

I wouldn't even walk to a store there if someone offered me a million dollars to go!!!! You have to valet your car on the premise - yes, that's great but now your obligated to tip the valet every time you want your car. That gets expensive!!!! If you want to park the car yourself you have to park on the street......GOOD LUCK GETTING BACK TO THE HOTEL WITHOUT BEING ROBBED, RAPED, OR WORSE! Entering the lobby, it was darker then dark inside & it took you a minute to figure out where you actually needed to go to check in. Checking in took about 1/2 hr because there was only 1 person behind the counter arguing with a guest. Finally someone comes from who knows where and they help us check in - Takes 5 mins. We take the elevator up to the floor of our room and when we step off the elevator into the hallway I could of been standing in a marijuana field! The smell was sooooo strong & sickly. We go into the room and its hotter then hell inside. Open the window and turn on the A/C. Then find the cologne in my husbands luggage to spray the room down from the stench of the marijuana. The furniture has been repaired a million times from being broken and is now falling apart. The little tiny shelf in the bathroom to put your belongings on is falling off the wall!. The bathroom doesn't look like the tub or shower has been cleaned in years! There is only 2 pillows on the bed so I call down to the front desk to have more pillows and towels sent up to the room. When they arrive they tell me that there is NO MORE PILLOWS IN THE WHOLE HOTEL!  We are suppose to be at the hotel for 3 nights - we go out to enjoy ourselves - upon returning the stench in the hallway again is beyond tolerable. I have never felt so unsafe in my life staying at a hotel. We literally jammed a chair behind the door so that we could go to sleep. Needless to say I did not sleep very much at all.

I had to unexpectedly change the dates of my trip, which starts tomorrow (June 15) and hotels.com would not have been able to do it without cancelling the reservation and booking a new room. I made the original reservation back in November, so the prices one month out were obviously no where near the same. Hotels.com wanted to charge me  MORE for half as many days less than what my original reservation was for in the first place. I panicked a little because this may have meant I would have needed to cancel this trip, which already is something that carried significant meaning to it, but, now more than ever...... I live in Orlando and with the recent events that have occurred this past weekend at a nightclub that I frequent, this trip has taken on an entirely new meaning for me and all of my friends who will be in Vegas and I just wanted to give a huge thank you to Sophia for helping me avert what could have been a serious problem for me.

A very few aren't, but that's not the majority AT ALL. I get the worst service here. From sitting and waiting and waiting and waiting for a drink, to being told to move out of a section that's reserved for the tweekers and ravers that hit every night. The ones that probably contribute little to the financial success of the bar than say, a professional there for drinks in a quiet, sexy atmosphere. Ahem. Yeah, service is bad.  Next is that they serve the lowest common denominator in alcohol and beer. The choices are so shockingly bad and cheap that I have zero idea how this bar stays afloat. If I want to drink Heineken in a dark place I have a closet in my room and a fridge to store it. Except that Heineken isn't allowed in my fridge so there's that.   This bar has appeal up until you need good service and a good drink then you're better off going to the bars on the strip. No thanks.

First of all - parking is valet only, so plan ahead and leave yourself $3-$5 for the guy at the end of the night.  Walking into the hotel is simply incredible. They have done an amazing job of decorating the place! While it IS dark inside, there is ample light to enjoy the various painting and mirrors on the walls and ceiling. There are quite a number of beautiful sculptures and vases throughout too.  There isn't a cover to get into the Afterhours party. Just show your ID and you're walking into a thumping techno party with some excellent house beats. The DJs are a lot of fun and the crowd there is very chill with a great appreciation for this type of music.  The alcohol flows generously and the costs are pretty reasonable. I don't remember specific prices, but I haven't ever felt like I was being ripped off.  While the dance floor area is a little small, it's still a lot of fun to groove with the electro beats as the DJ moves the crowd. Even better still is when you're hot and sweaty and want to relax, there are a number of VERY comfortable chairs, couches and love seats to relax on.  Fine leather furniture doesn't seem to match with the house/club music scene, but it really works well at the Artisan. For a little fresh air, try heading out to the patio too.

It is definitely a boutique hotel and it has that old feeling like you have walked inside something that's been around for a long time.  But there is also a modern kick to the feeling.  I like how you can hang out in the large lobby, in the lounge area near the bar, at the bar, and even outside on their fairly medium sized patio.  There are booths, tables, and heat lamps on the patio where you can hang outside and chat.  The only thing I wish they would do at this place is have a night striclty for Top 40, Hip Hop, and R&B.

An hour after that, someone opened the door with a card key (none of ours) and tried to walk in only to be held back by the slide bolt I locked on the door. I called downstairs and they said it had been either maintenance or housekeeping (the room was already clean). No apologies, they just said it wouldn't happen again.   What a bunch of shady assholes.   Our room was booked as a double queen. The beds were the double or twin bed width range and as far as length, my feet were hanging out long over the end. I'm 6 ft., barely taller than the average guy, but I felt like Fred Flintstone trying to sleep in a baby crib or something. These were nowhere near queen size, so there's basically an outright lie on the part of the Artisan.   We called three days in advance to request an odd-numbered room (the even numbers face the freeway). Of course, we got an even-numbered room. I guess every single odd room with two beds had already called before us to request theirs, right? Bullshit. They just screwed it up and couldn't admit it.  Management had a very smug, cavalier attitude in responding to our complaints. They didn't bother to offer as much as a comped drink in the lounge or something.   I will say the drinks were strong and the valet was helpful in recommending specific places for going out on the Strip. Everything else about the stay was negative.

Few people here, but took forever to get a drink, at strip prices. Looking to get a bottle and table, good luck!  Which leads to the  manager , who I believe would rather have ghetto kids with no money than clients that spend 1-3 grand to enjoy a DJ.  Overall, if you like spending good club prices for a ghetto experience, this is your place.

I say this because it is a very small hotel (5 stories) and the hotel is home to a popular after hours club. So from about 2am to 6am, you will not be able to sleep. Our room was on the top floor and it sounded like the club was next door. Our plan was to actually get a good nights sleep so we could have a full Saturday of fun, but that was impossible after staying here.   The hotel is in very close proximity to many strip clubs, and I suspect many patrons were working at said clubs. The smell of pot filled our hallway and my husband and I were stuffy from the smoke. In short, the hotel is in a questionable neighborhood and it is old. This is NOT a new hotel. The pool was also small, cold, and dirty. Do NOT be deceived by the photos of this place!!!  On check in the guy at the front desk did not tell us where anything was and we were left to figure it out. We also had to carry our own luggage. The self parking is a dirt lot across the street from the hotel. Thankfully, they have valet! We booked our room through Hotels.com and complained to them.

After that disgraceful little scene passed we had the reception during which the dinner portion of the evening was so badly handled that I gave up my place at the table because the food was not being served.  It seems the servers didn't know who was having what so the food was probably sitting around in the kitchen.  Many guests who had the steak option have reported they got ill from it.

We arrived around 9pm on our way home to Cali and the place smelled sort of like mold. First of all, the place is right next to the highway and with our discount rate, I just knew we'd get a noisy room. We were forwarned about the mandatory valet parking because of Yelp ($11.50 - lame) but not of the 'resort fee' ($3.50 - lamer). But whatever - the room was a decent price so we didn't complain. However, we had to wait almost an hour at the desk because the people before us had some problem with their room. When we got to our room, all that I really wanted to do was to take a shower, but there were no towels. I called down to the front desk and they assured us they'd be sent up. 1 hour later, no towels. Another call made. 30 minutes, no towels until the bf went down to the desk and came back with what looked and smelled like pool towels.   Forgiving that, the room was comfortable and very chic-ly decorated - and there is free WiFi.

I love the Artisan...once you get in the door there is an energy and an underground vibe that hits you because of the awesome, dark decor and the pulsing techno or house. The resident DJs also DJ various other clubs on the strip during the day or night and I think they really let loose with more experimental tunes and more flavor at Artisan because its after-hours and it's unpretentious and there's no cover, no VIP guest barking orders on what music he wants the DJ to be playing. As a local, I rarely EVER go to a club on the strip because all you find is pretentiousness and VIP big dogs like ultra rich and celebrities who want the house DJ to play  Livin' on a Prayer  and have been known to get well known house DJs KICKED OFF THE DECKS because they have such pull because of their money. So as far as music is concerned and club experience, Artisan is where it's at for me in Las Vegas. Minor updates could be applied like making an alternate walkway to the bathrooms (if possible) instead of directly through the dancefloor. I'm usually too wasted to concentrate on little inconveniences like that so that doesn't factor into why I gave 4 stars instead of 5.  The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because they are still employing some god-awful bouncers. I'm not sure where they get these people, especially the bald white guy with the attitude, but hassling people and giving them attitude is inexcusable when more than any other club I know of in Vegas, the people attending are just looking to have a good time. There are very few meatheads, no rabble rousers. Lighten the hell up!  I'm a security professional by trade. When I say security professional, I mean I was a bodyguard for Senators and a certain President in Iraq and in Afghanistan. I have 108 armed employees under my control currently. Securing an entrance and being a doorman does not require an attitude. In fact, it can escalate problems or cause them where there are none. People are coming in to spend money and create profit for the Artisan, why adversely affect their experience and cause them to not come back? I think the management at Artisan needs to seriously take a look at the people they hire out there. A smile and a common courtesy as opposed to a glare and snarl goes a long way when someone's first impression is the doorman.

Lobby is really dim-litted and with its sculptures and paintings decorated around the room, it sets this type of dark, gothic, artistic ambiance. They should probably hire a man dressed as a butler to open the doors and say,  Goood Eeveninngg  in a dark ominous voice to really perfect it. Definitely agree with Misty that it's very reminiscent of the Haunted Mansion.   We checked in Sunday night and the concierge informed us they have an after-hours club that takes place in the lobby and restaurant area and will last till 7AM. I've heard about these parties on the radio and was interested in checking it out. An important note to all the young-bucks who are interested in staying... YOU MUST BE 21 TO STAY HERE. The girl who helped us told us a story that a guy pre-paid a room and couldn't end up staying because he was 20, boy.. he must of been mad :\  Well we got to our room and the hallway leading up to it reminded me a lot of those haunted houses during Halloween time. It was dark, like the rest of the hotel, and covered in over-sized portraits beautifully framed to make them look like antiques. It was lots of fun to look at and definitely a very different experience I have gotten from the other hotels in Vegas. The room is.. yes, you guessed it.. dark (by dark I mean the walls are painted like maroon..) and covered in paintings. Doesn't look much like a typical Vegas room (of course), more like my own bedroom.. if I was a mysterious art-infatuated type. Although it overall sounds really grungy, the room itself is pretty clean and it comes with a flat screen so don't assume they play to the old dark renaissance times to its full extent.   Well sadly we didn't end up going to the party downstairs but .. it truly did go on till 7AM. If you're looking for a good night's rest on a weekend night, look elsewhere..cause it seems like the party never stops at this joint, or at least the loud music doesn't.   Definitely wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone looking for the glitzy, glamorous, Vegas experience.

This place... I've been debating about whether I should review this place as I visited here around the Memorial Day weekend. I think the gang booked this place because almost all other hotels were booked or too pricy. Located on the outskirts of the strip, this place was sort of off the access road because you can see it as you approach Las Vegas.   The first few thoughts/impressions of this place wasn't pleasant or warm and fuzzy. Let's just say that. The hotel was located in a dark and shady looking area of town. As you drive up, the hotel itself was dark. The bouncer judged us immediately and informed us to park 'over there' as we drove up asking about where to park. Parking was valet only, but we didn't know this as we drove around confused as to where to park our car. And in the morning, the only valet guy was doing his best, but we could have gotten our car much quicker.   The lobby area was interesting... To the right there was a club that was dead empty during a Saturday night of the Memorial Day weekend. The ceilings, yes ceilings, and walls had all sorts of strange paintings. Some were of nude women and such oddities. There were statutes, suits of armors, and random knick knacks you can find in a Clue game. There was even a running water fountain right there near the reception desk. The vibe here was mystic and dark. It was as if they tried to make it seductive for whatever reason. And trust me, even in the morning, it wasn't much better.   And as you walk thru the hallways to get to your room, the mirrors and strange eclectic items on the wall just adds to the dark and creepy vibe of this place. The rooms and bathrooms itself wasn't any better. The lighting was still dim, the items and furniture were dark, and mirrors were still all around. The only unique thing about the rooms is that each room had only paintings by one artist. That was about the only interesting thing I can find to write about.   The more wonderful thing was that you can hear and feel the club downstairs. Legit. And the folks even messed up our reservation as we asked for two beds, and they ended up giving us rooms with a single king size bed. Yeah... The four girls ended up sharing this one bed with a fellow guy friend taking the floor so the couple could have their own room. It was a fun sleepover, but it wasn't what we hoped for.   And don't turn to channel 29 (?). Man, as I was lying on the bed chilling with a gf while waiting for the other girls and just flipping thru the channels, I came across channel 29. Um. Yeah. That wasn't a pleasant surprise at it was sort of a triple x sort of show. Yup. Close up and uncensored too.  x_x  I kid you not I screamed so abruptly that caused my friend to freak out and the other in the bathroom to come running out asking what was wrong. Yeah.

They were very nice and super helpful. I also appreciated the complementary valet but despite this I will never stay here again. I love the idea behind this hotel and thought the lobby was pretty cool looking which made a good first impression. But as soon as you step into the elevator you can tell this is just an older hotel thats been given a quickie makeover. There is no real convenience shop for toiletries and such just a small cabinet behind the check in counter. Also if you want food you need to leave the hotel or order delivery. The room was an average size but had minimal pillows and even with all the lights on in the room the lighting was still very dim. Our room also had some type of burn on the toilet seat lid and a big patch on the ceiling. The handle to turn on the shower got stuck halfway up so the water temperature was limited as well. However, I would say the worst part is the noise level. The first night we could hear every word of our neighbor's drunken argument because of the thin walls. The second night we were told the rooftop pool party always lasts until 6 in the morning and since we were on the top floor the music felt like it was being pumped directly into our room. To sum up, if you don't care about getting any sleep or having a pleasant shower then feel free to stay here.

The good...  Cool atmosphere and decor.  21 and over so no kids running around.  Decent late night party scene.  Pool is small but its fun when you have a big group.  Front desk girls were pretty cool.  They don't really jump on your case for things the bigger hotels do like bringing your own cooler full of beers/booze to the pool... because they didn't have a waitress working the pool or bar.  Valet was helpful and cool.  The bad...  Visited for 3 nights (Thurs - Sun) and not once was the restaurant open.  Most of the day there wasn't even a bar tender present at the friggen bar.  WTF!?  Not even a vending machine in the place to purchase a bottled water when you wake up parched and hungover in the morning/afternoon.  You ask the staff about it and they just shrug it off.  Asked about the restaurant a few times and they just kept saying things like,  they'll open at 5pm because its too slow , but then never open (the hotel was fully booked up, by the way).  Since its tucked away in an industrial area, there is not a restaurant or hotel near by (except a ghetto one) so if you want food and sometimes a drink, you have to take a $15-$20 taxi ride somewhere else because you ain't getting it at the hotel.  Oh and no ice machines... you have to take the slow ass elevator to the bar for ice and most of the day, there is no bar tender to help you.  When it came to service, they just completely dropped the ball.  Seemed like they just didn't care.  The hotel was completely booked due to a friends wedding so it was mind boggling that they weren't prepared.  A bunch of guests of the wedding checked out early and went to some of the  bigger  hotels on the strip and some just got over it went home.

I don't feel good about this review - since I generally give any business the benefit of the doubt, but this particular hotel is by far the worst experience I've ever had since coming to Vegas - and I've been coming to Vegas since I was 12 years old (I'm 38 now) and I'm mortified by my time spent here in this hotel - if you choose to call this place a hotel.  The  afterhours  party is obnoxious, redundant, loud, and sickening.  Especially if your room is above the pool.  And by the way, the pool is dirty and small and only open until 7pm - and it's about 3 feet deep.  My bathtub is bigger.   There is no casino.  The restaurant is never open.  And the bar is always empty.  I had to pay $5 for a  PLASTIC  glass of sprite from the well.  Just a sprite.  NO liquor.   There's no fridge in the room unless you opt for a junior suite.  There are no ice machines - so be prepared to walk downstairs in a drunken stupor to ask the bartender for a bucket of ice.  The nearest casino will cost you about $10 for a taxi ride.  There are no vending machines - in case you get the  munchies .  And who wants to pay $8 for a bottle of water!?  Are you kidding me!?  If I could get my money back, I would.  But, I purchased my stay from ORBITZ and there are no refunds.   The water constantly drips from the shower.  And although this hotel is 'green' - (the energy saving keycard) - it's annoying.  The lights turn off constantly.    My ironing board was broke.  My iron leaked water.  The wif-fi was spotty.   The street noise is constant and deafening.    The elevator is slow. ONE ELEVATOR, by the way.  The art is cool but not cool enough to pay for the drama that has occurred over the last 72 hours.  I did complain and the manager upgraded my room on the first night, so the customer service was superior - I will give them that plug.  But, this HOTEL isn't first-class enough to make my stay pleasant.   I feel bad for giving this hotel a one-star review.  Especially since I haven't checked out of my room yet.  But it's so frustrating not being able to have the VEGAS convenience of food and gambling.    My wife is sick in bed this evening and it would be soooo gratifying to be able to purchase some seltzer and some ib profin!  Without exorbitant prices!  But, alas, this HOTEL is disappointing.    I'm starving, dehydrated, and broke.    This hotel could make a lot of money if the owner just put in a few slot machines, a deli, and the option for 24-hour room service.  That's all.    I'm not sure how this hotel is making it.  They are on the fast-track to a bankrupt business.   It's been a ghost town for the last 48 hours!  I feel bad for the valet and bar staff.    I'm not a snob but this is THE WORST hotel in Vegas.  HANDS DOWN!  WORST!    I don't like throwing out explanation points like this - but I'm staring at my ill wife and a watered down glass of sprite.  I can't wait to check out of this hell hole.  I 'almost' don't want to visit Vegas ever again.  And that's a sad & recent development.      If you want the Vegas experience, fork out the extra few hundred and stay at The Mandalay.

After spending close to $400 yesterday at our hotel's dayclub pool, the hubs and I decided to go in a different direction and go off strip to this boutique hotel.  Not the warmest welcome at the desk. We were completely ignored by the only employee at the desk for a solid minute before another employee greeted and directed us to the pool. The decor kinda worked! I liked the dark red velvety interior. It was clean and even though it's small, The Artisan is really pretty nice.  We had our choice of daybeds and cabanas FREE OF CHARGE, and the pool all to ourselves. How's that for Vegas! I also didn't get harassed for swimming without my top. That was nice. The music was good, and at a reasonable volume. The water was cool, and felt GREAT! I will say, the cabanas and daybeds could use some maintenance.  Unfortunately, no food or beverages were available for purchase. Never thought I'd be starving in a city where you can get anything at any time of day, but there you go. Also, there was some construction going on in the parking lot or side road, the noise and smell were nauseating!  Eventually two other groups came, not our crowd, but I wouldn't have minded if they didn't smoke and didn't turn on their tv...and walk away.

AFTERHOURS: You can drink, party, and crash all in the same place! The lonely bar of the Artisan has turned into one of the hottest places to party in Las Vegas. LV Weekly named it the Best Afterhours in town! If you can get past the crowd-control issue and all the people wearing sunglasses indoors, then get over here: no cover, no line, no dress-code, no hassle. They're open Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. And DJ MikeAttack & Stellar make regular appearances here. If you don't like house, you won't like it here  BIRTHDAY DEAL: If it's your birthday month, Afterhours will comp you a table and  a bottle of Sky. All you need is 6+ people, an ID, and money for tip. Email bday@artisanhotel.com to book this deal. Can't get that at the clubs...  ROOMS: I've only been in the standard  Artisan Classic  rooms. Despite being small, they're clean, comfy, and well-decorated. The window cracks open for ventilation and the bathrooms aren't too shabby. The ceilings are pretty low so tall people might feel a little cramped. But, they're incredibly cheap! We're talking $50-60 during the weekdays and $100-140 on weekends.

Not 100% sure but she was of African American decent and was super awesome. They kept our drinks flowing and delivered our meals in a timely manner.

Because there was a wine event there that was completely separate from anything to do with the Artisan, and after a glass of wine I was actually semi impressed by the appetizer list the Artisan put out. I decided to go with the 9$ plate of beef kabobs ( steak , onions , peppers, how could you go wrong ? ) After about 20-25 min on waiting on a  10 min order  I was brought this plate of tiny little pieces of steak on a stick each one had  one onion slice and one square of a cold green pepper . There was also a side of sauce that fell before I ever saw the plate but the waitress wouldn't mind getting me another sauce  if I really wanted her to .... I wasnt even sure the food was warm anymore so I tasted a piece before I took the photo. The plate was warmer then the food but after the bothered tone I was met with about the spilled sauce I was more then reluctant to send my food back into that kitchen. *scary* When asked if I needed anything else I asked her for napkins,those were never brought . I suppose she couldn't be bothered to come right back with those. 9$ for this plate of luke warm beef bites worth it ?

Lounge Inn at the Artisan Pool.  This is not the kind of pool party on the strip with ridiculous long lines, expensive entry charge, meat heads, bikini platforms with foolish makeup and thousands of dollars spent on cabanas or day beds.  Lounge Inn is every Sunday with no entry fee starting at 3pm continues until 10 pm and for loungers that aren't ready to go home yet, special Lounge Inn room rates are available for $40 per night. Bottle specials start at $150 with a day bed or cabana, food from the Artisan's restaurant can be ordered poolside, while watching your favorite sports on a LCD screen and listening to beats.  The food is amazing! I recommend the spinach salad with strawberries and pecans, burger and fries and the flat bread pizza Margherita!  Sunday's Lounge Inn atmosphere is intimate.  There are amazing locals with positive vibe who musically appreciates deep house, disco, afro beats, reggae, soul and mid tempo funk. It is the music that brings the people together at this party and when they do, it's all about peace, love, happiness and lots of smiles on the dance floor!  In addition, Lounge Inn is a themed event.  My attendances have been the All White Party, Parasol Sun Umbrella Twist, Beach Ball Birthday Bash and what's next? Be sure to get on Keith Evan's email list to find out for future Lounge Inn themed events and guest DJ's!

First I will begin with the food and service   Food/Service: I had plans to go out with some friends for a casual dinner and drinks. We made reservations at the reststaurant located inside the bar area of the hotel. When we got there we were seated in the restaurant and shortly after told that they did not have a server working that night. I would expect this to happen in a small town at 9pm on a Sunday night but not in Vegas! We were given the option of sitting at the bar to eat and we decided that it was a better idea than looking for another place to eat . When we at at the bar we had a bartender that was extremely annoyed at the fact that we were ordering food! We ordered our food and drinks and immediately after she was already wanting to give us our check so we can leave. We were sitting with a check for over priced bar food and empty stomachs. We sat next to two other people that came in way after us and they got their food immediately while we were sitting waiting and waiting for our food. Once our food got to us it was cold! It was literally one bust after another. I had the sliders which came with fries. The sliders had bacon with some sort of hickory sauce and cheese. The fries that came with the sliders we cold and frankly took my hunger away because they were so awful.   The food menu offered at the bar included: Chicken wings for $12.00 Basil and Sausage Flatebread for $12.00 Margarita Flat Bread for $ 9.00  Homemade  chili cheese fries for $9.00 Artisan Slider for $12.00 - which include fries (This is what I had and I wouldn't recommend it) There were also a few other menu options like an Artichoke Dip that did not look very appealing.  Drinks The price range of drinks is about how much you would pay at any night club or bar on the Strip. I had a midori sour and the price was roughly $12.00.  I usually like this drink because it is a combination of a sweet and sour. This midori sour was unlike any I have ever tasted and not in a good way. The midori sour didn't have any  sour  in it at all. It tasted like watered down sugar with a touch of alcohol. I was very disappointed and did not order another drink after that.   Overall I give the service a 1.5 and if it wasn't for the amazing atmosphere of the hotel has I would never consider going back.   Atmosphere  The atmosphere of this Boutique Hotel is AMAZING! The lighting is dim and the entire lobby and bar had lots of things to keeps your eye busy. There are little mirrors all over the ceilings with a lot of unique paintings and chandeliers. There is also a huge fountain in the middle of the lobby and different status throughout. The entire place is just beautiful and perfect for a big or small group of friends to go to. I don't recommend anything that they offer for consumption like the drinks or food but this place is so fun to be in. You can spend a good hour just looking around at all the different things they have as decorations.  ROOMS: Although I have never stayed at any of the room here they are very reasonable in price ($32.00 was the room rate when I went) but if it's anything like the lobby or bar area I would stay there is a heart beat.

My boyfriend and I stayed here for nearly 5 days for a conference, and there was a lot to like, but a lot that needed improvement.  First, we stayed during the week, so we didn't experience the club at all. No one at the pool because, well, it was winter and kind of cold-ish outside. I would give this place another shot in the summertime to check out the pool scene. However, I was told (my our cab driver, of all people) that the after after hours scene here is crazy. I don't know if that's good crazy, or scary crazy or what, so... yeah. Not sure if I'm up for that.   We stayed in the Picasso mini-suite. The room looked chic, but needs some work! The carpet was LUMPY. Not sure what kind of stuff is under the rug, but I don't want to find out! The lamp didn't work (no bulb), and in the cold light of day, we could see imperfections all over the place (places that needed some paint, a little better cleaning, etc).   In the bathroom, there's a rusty vent right above the tub. :|  No space to put your stuff (toothbrush, makeup, etc.) Sharing this bathroom between two people was nearly impossible. We also didn't anticipate so much noise from the freeway outside... it definitely more than I thought it would be. The amenities were sparse (you get a shampoo and a soap. That's all). It's cool if that's all you get, but with a boutique hotel, I thought - yeah, they'll at least provide the hair stuff and some soap for the sink AND tub. Oh well.  However, we did like that the room had a walk-in closet, a mini-bar (fridge WITH humidor in it... nice!), a safe, and some other amenities. The price was better than places on the strip (although keep in mind you'll pay about $15 each way to get to the strip, and that's if your cab driver knows where they're going. We had one dude drive us PAST Palace Station and then loop back - all on our dime), and the customer service was really great. Valet guys are really cool, and after a few days, I felt like everyone  knew  us.   So yeah. We'll probably give this place one more try in the summer/spring.

When you get in, though, the scene is anything but bland. Water fountains, a huge piano,  comfy red chairs and comfy black leather chairs and oh yeah... paintings and mirrors all over the ceiling. When you walk in the bar, the vibe is the same. The bar is huge and there is plenty of seating.

You can park around the corner or in the random lot across the street, but your car might get jacked. Use the valet parking.

It was pretty ridiculous, and I'm a fairly patience person. Our guy friends had gotten a table and had ordered 2 bottles, and it took the waitresses at least 45minutes to bring out the bottles, mind you, there was still barely anyone at the club, so there was no reason why it should've taken so long to get drinks.  The crowd was quite eclectic. There were some people dressed up because it is Vegas, but then since this is off the strip, there were people dressed up as cows, Jesus, and prisoners.

Unfortunately they have mandatory valet parking of $11 dollars a day and they don't have any bell boys, so we had to drag our over packed luggage into the hotel..but with only 65 rooms, how many bell boys do you need? The check in process was easy and I requested an odd number, because since this hotel is literally off the 15 fwy you  supposedly  hear the traffic noise and the odd number room keep you towards the side of the hotel that doesn't face the freeway. We where in room 511, which was good since we where on the top floor and our room was just right to the elevator exit...The room was very dark, mirrors in the entire room and was themed after artist William Frieseke.

We could tell it wasn't the best room with chips on the banner of the bed and furniture but it was all very clean and had a nice plasma screen TV, I heard there was porn( but it must have been removed). The bathroom was clean with a nice supply of towels and soaps and shampoo and had a rainfall shower head with wonderful pressure, but no blow dryer?

I'm glad we weren't there during summer time, since it did take awhile for the room to cool off. The bed was very comfy, even thou it wasn't used for more then 4 hours of sleep per day.

TRAGICALLY EPIC: It's completely off the strip so I definitely think it's more a place for locals and/or for youngsters who strictly like to party rather than to gamble (there is no casino).  It's pretty noisy and NOT a relaxation spot.  Depending on which room and floor you're staying on, you can feel the vibrations of the party all day and night.  During the day, from the topless-pool festivities, and during the night, from the night club that takes over the lounge and bar area.  Everything is very dark, and the red mood lighting in the hallways that lead to your room feels slightly like you're approaching Dante's inferno.  There are no shortages of mirrors gaudily decking the walls and ceilings, nor of famous painting-reproductions framed in three+ solid inches of gilded filigree. It's a little seedy but it really hold's its own charm.    TRAGIC:  The rooms are not dirty... they just aren't the cleanest you've seen, and when it's as dark as it is here, it just doesn't FEEL as fresh as you'd like it to feel in an hotel.  Nonetheless, every single staff member from the valet to the front desk was pleasant and accommodating- even after they'd had to deal with my group asking them to do back flips for as long as we did.   There is only one elevator and it is slow. There is no ice at your disposal.  In fact, if you need ice, you'll have to go down to the bar and request it from the bartender. (Major losses on that one.)    EPICALLY TRAGIC:  There are there are three types of rooms available: the artisan classic, the boutique suite, and the masterpiece suite (which tragically, there is only one of).  I do not recommend staying at this hotel unless you are very low maintenance, but if you're ready to party it up, feel young, and want to do things a little differently, pay up and book that masterpiece suite because it's super fun in there.  It's spacious, there are two bathrooms, couches, walk-in closets, and a pocket-ball table you can play or have sex on whilst watching yourselves on the mirrors glued to the ceiling.   This place is not my cup of tea, but even I must admit, it grew on me.  I would personally give it 2 stars- but I have no trouble seeing how some folks would love it.", "Date": "2014-10-09", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Amanda", "ReviewID": "S2I5QX0j6EAD44BLt2qV9w", "Overall": "2", "Content": "I was not impressed with this place.  The Artisan is a boutique hotel frequented by swingers a couple of miles off the strip. On the weekends, their bar turns into a club. My partner and a bunch of his friends booked the hotel for an entire week. It sure was... something.  Our comforter was torn, all the paintings on the walls were suggestive or naked women and everything was weirdly dark. Beds aren't as firm as I prefer. On the one plus side, the shower was amazing: wide faucet with strong water pressure. We only had our room serviced once for the entire week we were there. Housekeeping showed up relatively early, so if you're out partying in Vegas until sunrise, prepare for a 11 a.m. knock. All of this would've been tolerable, except...  We made one request to have the room cleaned since housekeeping always arrived so early. We returned 8 hours later to discover that our room had been cleaned, but that the door was left propped open during a time when the bar nightclub was happening. I don't know if the card key for the elevator was broken or just inactive, but we didn't need it for the entire time we stayed there. Someone could have taken the elevator, gone into our room and grabbed our stuff while we were out.   If you don't own anything of value, you might be fine staying here.

It had the same cool affect as the lobby but pictures and mirrors were hung on the wall crooked, the floor felt like it was caving in, it seemed like it had been throw together rather quickly & the front desk staff were dicks, they kept changing the incidental policy/deposit on us.

It's different for sure and nice to come check it out, but to stay no thank you!  So spoiled from The Wynn, Cosmo, and Vdara....  Where to start.... When we first got into the room, the lights wouldn't turn on.  We put the room key into the key slot that's required for the energy to turn on.  For some reason the light switch wouldn't work, you have to press the button like 5-6 times!  The bathroom look is the WORST!  It wouldn't even turn on after soo soooo many times!  And the worst of this is that, finally you would get it to turn on, it would turn off in a second!  It's like.. WTH?!?  The couch's foot is broken...You can see from the metal foot all the screws are hanging out.  -_-!  Ok now...this is the worst part...the bed sheets and blankets were sooooo GROSS!  You can remove the sheets and see stains and hair ALL OVER THE BEDDING!  We just removed all the bedding stuff and used the blanket in the closet...boy, that has hair and stains all over it too.  Stains were yellow, gray and black!  o.O  If you're gonna want to sleep in a quiet hotel, this isn't the spot.  We got back to the hotel around 5:20am and people were still getting to the hotel and people were still raging it like crazy in the lobby and the lounge.  Also in our room 415, I think the hotel outside speaker was right outside of our room, you can hear music blasting at 10 am.  It's so loud that we can even shazam the dang song! As it gets later the music gets louder!    The house keeping was the worst!  Worst Service ever of this place, obviously! But at 11am, they literally bang on your room and tell you have to check out now.  She did it 3 times really loud.   Excuse you, lady!  We called for a late check out until 3pm and we're paying extra for it .  She even asked us,  Are you sure, you have late check out?     Dude, what do you mean are we sure?

Soon after showing my I.D. and having my hand stamped I was literally grabbed by one of the bouncers because he assumed, for some reason, that I wasn't a local and was instructed that I would have to pay the $14 cover. I quickly explained to him that since I only had my passport, I'd be happy to show him my business card. His response was to send me to talk to his supervisor out front. Once I walked away, this same doorman was overheard, by one of friends (whom he obviously didn't know I was with) that I should  learn to read a book . Since I've been in the service industry for over 25 years, I can understand that dealing with the public can be trying at times, but at no time was I disrespectful and quite frankly I didn't think it was that big of a deal, so I wasn't mad in the least.  Why a business that boasts that it caters to locals and industry people be so rude to someone who is clearly both and not being verbally combative in the least, is beyond me. The man's  supervisor  was sympathetic to my dilemma and apologized for how his colleague treated me, but pointed out that my passport didn't have a local address (even though I got it while living in Vegas) and at no time did he offer to let me in without paying. Well Artisan, I can safely say that you've overcharge me for my last cocktail in your establishment and I'll make sure to tell the many service industry people that I know, after living in the valley for over a decade, how you treat the people that made you who you are.

I havent been in a while (6 months or so) If things have changed since then, (like staff, I have no complaints there but it may be outdated)  This is where we stay when we go for a weekend. Normally when we go for longer than that we stay elsewhere, because it's normally for business and sleep is more important than fun.  It's Loud. I'm OK with that. You should know about this is advance and not complain. I'm ok with the shabby thing and the darkness and the wait for the car and all of that.  I LOVE that the rooms arent a million miles from the front door, I love that its not a casino, I love the paintings and the themes. I love all that artsy stuff. I love that we were never pointed to some big place to go eat, it was always something cool and funky. If you ask for an opinion about where to go and tell them off the beaten path, they give you the real skinny.  Reading other people's reviews, I realize that my memories are better than the real thing. But I am always happy after I've stayed, so my issues are generally small and easily taken care of.  To tell the truth I am a little bummed about there no longer being breakfast here, it was amazing and I really liked the convenience.  I've seen complaints about waiting for room service, I'm never in a hurry when I ask for room service so this never bothered me. If it were pressing, I would go out and get whatever I needed myself. I've never been overly dependant on room service, no matter where I stay.  Free Porn, on a loop, but still, free porn. Friendly staff (as I remember it, but again, its been a while) Champagne was warm when we got, everytime, but it was FREE to begin with and I didn't really expect much for it.  My annoyances stem from, no ice machine, having to go all the way down to the bar to get ice is frustrating at 2am. Especially when your not there to party, your not dressed up and you just want a cold drink. Who brings their ID to an Ice machine? Well, you will here because you won't get in that late at night, even for ice, without it. (though maybe you could if you flirt with the guards...)  People have kicked my door, thinking it was the party across the hall. I don't blame the hotel for that, or that there was a party there, but I do have a complaint about the parties on the hotel room floors that spill into the hall, especially when they leave the doors to their rooms open. Also I'm not a pot smoker, if partiers choose to partake, that's their business, but don't smoke it in the halls. Have more respect.   I don't like the marshmello beds, We've found that the king beds are much more comfortable for us as a couple when we go. I only ever got doubles in the first place so we would have more lounging room.  Last but not least, its kind of a pain to get to, we get lost on our way in almost everytime and the first 2 times it really annoyed us since it was very late and we were tired to begin with.  Its a little run down, every room doesnt have a fridge, you have to wait to get your car, but I've never had the staff not follow through on promises made.   I'd go again. I don't know why people have trouble with the neighborhood or whatever.

Do NOT rely on their  sales staff  for anything other than to give you pricing.  The service I received...or lack thereof left MUCH to be desired.  At the end of the day, no one from corporate sales was even at my wedding to fascilitate the events or coordinate ANYTHING.  I had billing mixups less than 24 hours before my wedding. I went through 3 different  coordinators  that all promised different things.  I wasn't made aware of the over 21 hotel guest policy until my guests started to call to make room reservations.  I could go on and on.  And I will spare details about a certain person who is beyond condisceding.   The reason I still gave the venue 4 stars is because of the hotel staff.  The service in Mood was phenom!  The head waiter found my mother and told her as mother of the bride, she was his priority to be taken care of.  I wish I could remember his name...blonde guy....soooo sweet.  Came up to congratulate me and my new husband. T he food was delish also.  All of our guests were very impressed.  The GM Mike was especially accommodating.  He locked up my dress for me downstairs which was so helpful.  Very nice!  When I did go back there to pick up a few items, he also continued to follow up with me about my wedding and asked how everything went.  I expressed my disappointment and he did apologize even though it had nothing to do with his staff.  He made me feel so much better even just by asking.

The place turns into an after hour's club, so yes there will be noise and yes there be party people everywhere, BUT this is Vegas people and this hotel is amazing.  If you want a nice quiet stay, and chill out and go to bed early kind of hotel, well this isn't the hotel for you. This is the place you go to after all the other parties have died out in Vegas. They do not even allow anyone under 21 to stay at the hotel.    The decorations are amazing and make you feel like you have entered an adult wonderland when you first walk in. With old paintings covering the walls and ceilings like they were randomly through thrown into place.  Red velvet and wood carved chairs, black tile and paint on the walls, give it a feel of an inviting erotic play land which was perfect for me.    I lived in Vegas for a couple of years and have pretty much stayed in most of the big hotels, and after my stay here I will never stay on the strip again. This hotel is defiantly for the locals or people like me who have been to Vegas countless times and tired of the huge crowds and drunken morons on the strip, and the flipity flab of the escort business cards being shoved in your face on your way back to your high priced hotel.   This was an old lodge turned into a very nice after hours hotel, so yes there are bound to be some rooms that are a little run down and maybe not up to your standards but the hotel staff is amazing and want to be as accommodating as possible but again, this is not a place for sleep and relaxation.    The first room I got was run down, and kind of smelled, I went down and told the manager who was a very sweet and nice girl and change my room right away and the second room I got was on the 5th floor and was amazing. I couldn't even hear the night club down stairs.  She didn't even charge me for the first night, I truly felt like she was more interested in my being happy then trying to quote policy to keep my money like many other hotels in Vegas do.  As for the location, yes it is a little shady looking around the hotel, but it sure does beat all the crowds on the strip and I LOVE its secluded location. I felt very safe and comfortable the whole time, no issues outside the hotel at all and if I was staying on the strip I would have had to deal with drunken fools trying to put their hands on the girl I was with.   The people that show up to this hotel for the party are amazing too, night life folk as I like to call them. They know how to party and have fun without all the drama and not over doing it; Fun to talk to and BEAUTIFUL. I met these two girls in patio section, super sweet and very beautiful and seem to be at this hotel often, everyone just seems so open and friendly.    Fetish and gay friendly, everyone is amazing from the manager, to the cleaning people to the valets, which is free btw and they watch your cars like a hawk.  I will be returning but next time I am going to get the masterpiece sweet, did I mention how cheap this hotel is? Well go check it out, pictures DO do it justice.

This rating is for the horrible customer service we experienced.   I came with a party of 3 and we stayed here due to the inflated prices from the iHeart Radio festival. We didn't mind it being off the strip and it's  supposed  to be a boutique hotel.   Everything was great for the first night. The next morning, we left around 10:30 AM and made sure to take off the Do Not Disturb sign and when we came back around 7:30 PM we found our room not yet serviced. Clearly we were forgotten. We called the front desk and was put on hold several times. Eventually we got through and we told the front desk receptionist that we our room was not serviced. To which she replies, with no apology,  oh, okay.  Ridiculous. Anyway, we were not in the mood to argue and we asked for clean towels. 1 hour later, still no towels. Basically, one of us had to shower and with no clean towels. We eventually picked up the towels from the receptionist later in the evening.  What takes the icing off the cake and what inadvertently allowed us to decide to never come back was the horrible gatekeeper/ bouncer for the after hours club. We came back to the hotel (with a room key clearly visible in our hands) and was basically verbally assaulted by the bouncer. As if stating we were staying in the hotel with a key and letting him know which room number we were in was not enough, he wanted our names. Seriously? His reply:  YES, SERIOUSLY . What's up with the attitude? Get over yourself.   Pros: cheap prices, not far from strip. Cons: Loud after hours party (below on lobby level), no house keeping, lack of taxi access, no organization of entire hotel, and the worst customer service you will encounter.

You poor unfortunate souls.  Being a Vegas 'local', the Artisan is known for their party atmosphere. This begins with the rule of having to be 21+ to stay here.  I am a little embarrassed to say that I had not gone to the Artisan until a few weeks ago. Once I got past the maze of industrial buildings and strip clubs and reached my destination, I couldnt figure out where the self parking was. I pulled into valet to ask where to park. The valet dude was very friendly, pointing to the gravel lot just across the street. Since he was friendly, I figured I'd just valet. I was carrying 3 dozen cupcakes and brownies for a party that I was attending there, and as soon as he saw them, he inquired about me attending the party that was being held there. I was impressed that he knew about the party, and he even knew which room it was being held at. Brownie points for him. In fact, I offered him an actual brownie, but he declined, being at work and all..  The hotel lobby is bananas! ceilings full of mirrors and turn of the century/haunted mansion/french/renaissance/dungeon decor. (picture lots of brass, blood red, gold, velvet, and dimly lit areas throughout the property. Definitely my cuppa tea! The 'dark' decor theme continued as I reached the 5th floor. The suite that we had booked was awesome. A pool table in the middle of the room, with an adjacent bedroom. There was a small sink/counter area combo that worked perfectly for a bar, and we had rearranged the furniture to accomodate a small dance floor and DJ set up.   As other yelpers have mentioned, there are no ice machines, but we planned ahead and brought plastic buckets to fill with ice down at the bar. The bartender was very accomodating and helped scoop ice from the machine for us. We cruised around the lobby, as I couldnt get over the decor. Be sure to check out their library if you're into the whole atmosphere experience.  Ladies and gents, we partied our asses off in that sweet little suite. The whole 5th floor shook with the loudness from our DJ. This was both a plus and a creepy factor: the whole time I was there, I did not see any hotel patrons that were not part of our party. I did not see anyone at guest check in, only a valet employee and the bartender. It made me feel like I was part of a creepy chapter 2 of The Shining. LOVED IT!  Linens on the bed were clean smelling, as were the bathrooms. Got the grungy feeling on my feet after kicking my heels off and running rampant on hotel room carpet, but that can be said (and felt) at every hotel.  If you're looking for a fun and unique experience, and not peace and quiet, definitely check out the Artisan.

The staff is friendly, and its modest size is a nice break from the crowds on the strip.  Two things that knocked down the rating of this otherwise great hotel.  First, the location is a little awkward.  It's probably not a problem if you're driving, but if you're taking the bus be aware that the bus stop is a little ways away, and you have to cross under a highway overpass on foot, which isn't a great feeling late at night (although the surrounding area is well lit and feels safe).  Secondly, it's not perfectly equipped.  Our room was a little cold, so we called and asked for blankets, but they didn't have any.  I would recommend staying here, but if the price is the same as hotels downtown, the downtown hotels will probably be more convenient for most attractions (especially if traveling by bus).", "Date": "2014-12-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Nicola", "ReviewID": "RFFSZ_NtPRB45HRK1qP_gw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "This place is great, it is an oasis in Vegas and doesn't even feel like you are in Vegas.

The patio offers a little sanctuary when the music is getting too loud and the cigar smoke too thick- I must admit I loved this place more when it was less club-like and more sophisticated.

I've seen pictures on Hotels tonight and was very intrigued by them and wanted to go by and visit the hotel lobby on my next Vegas visit. Was not intending to stay there, but stayed 1 night because of the good deal on Hotels tonight. Did not know anything about the after-hours club, or the noise level. If I did I would have not chosen to stay here, as the music was overwhelming coming up thru the floors of the 4 story hotel. Upon check in the valet asked if we stayed here before or knew about the hotel. When we said no, he told us about the club going to 8am. Apparently the only nights they do not have the after-hours club is on Monday and Tuesday, so ask for a room that is not over the club.  We are not club people, so getting back into the hotel at night was like going thru security at the airport lol, had to speak to 2 different people to get into the lobby to get to the elevator to get to the room.   The noise level was loud, but it was because the walls were thin and we could hear the dog in the room next door yelp and bark, the traffic outside because of the thin glass window, and the people above us sounded like they were going to come thru the floor into our room when they walked since the squeaking was so bad. Also the hallways are loud since the floor is tiled and not carpeted. Since this hotel is an old Travelodge, so are the rooms and I took that into consideration with the thin walls and floors. Unfortuantly our A/C didn't cool the room even tho is was on the coolest setting at 60 degrees, it only cooled the room down to about 75.   Loved the chic goth style of the hotel, but it's better for more of a drink and not to stay unless maybe you're going to the after-hours party.

Here's what it's got going for it:  1.  It's not on the Strip.  For most that would be a con, but look at it this way:  you come to Vegas to play on the Strip all day, it's exhausting and overwhelming by the time you're done.  Why not sleep somewhere where there isn't any neon outside your window?  2.  It's close to the Strip.  So you can still do all those  Vegas  things you want to do.  3.  The decor is AWESOME!  Every room is themed after a different artist and all throughout the bar and lounge areas there are reproductions of famous artwork EVERYWHERE.  Even the ceilings!  It's funky, different and very well put together.  4.  There is NO GAMING.  This is a particular plus for those who like the craziness of Vegas but occasionally just want to get a nice martini at a classy bar without the  klang klang, boop boop boop, cha-ching -ing sounds playing on repeat all night.  This place is a favorite of the locals for this very reason.  5.  Martinis are delicious and unique AND not insanely expensive.  6.

The bed cover had balled up feathers through out it rather than being dried properly to where they would be dispersed evenly so it wasn't very comfortable.

You call ahead to plan an event and you only get ONE bartender. The bar back was heard screaming she couldn't mix a drink because  that would get confusing.  After about 30 minutes standing around when we wanted to get drunk we threw up our hands, the bartender also had taken our order and just made other peoples drink while we sat around watching and waiting.

PRO:  The hotel lobby, bar, etc. is GORGEOUS in a tongue in cheek gothic sort of way - just really fun decor that makes you want to take a lot of sexy pics ; )  CON:  Rooms weren't as luxurious & decadent looking as they are in the pics - - but this could be that we got one of the rinky-dinkier rooms.   I did notice some rooms looked way cooler than others.  Also, the bathroom amenities were terrible - - - but, i'll give those up for the lower price!  ....i like to use my own shamp/conditioner anyway.  PRO/CON:  Even though they're a smaller operation than what you'd find on the strip, they DO have a restaurant w/ room service.  Sometimes just eating something....anything...will help you feel more human the morning after many redbull/vodkas.  The room service did its job...our blood sugar levels were normalized.   .......However, the food was just barely  eh ....the chorizo quesadilla was sooooo greasy - but, I'm probably just being a Hermosa Beach brat.  It's a quesadilla - they're greasy sometimes.  That being said...if the room service is any indication, I'd steer clear of their restaurant for dinner reservations.  CON:  Even though they're a boutique hotel, they still charge the  highway robbery  prices of the big places like The Cosmopolitan.  I almost agree with high prices at a hotel that has so much upkeep (like the gorgeous  Chandelier Bar  at Cosmo....) but, in a smaller place like Artisan, I don't agree with such a raping for 2 simple Vodka/Diets - with tip: $24.  Screw you...I'll bring my own vodka & order a diet next time.  CON:  We didn't have much hot water : (  Cool/Lukewarm showers suck.

I heard that during the summer this is a much more  happenin'  pool spot, but i get the feeling that it's a little more chill party than what you'd find at those frat house on steroids type pools.

First, the service was not so good. We spent our first morning away from Las Vegas, and when we came back around 15 pm our room was still untidy. As the cleaning woman arrived, I asked her if she could come back 30 minutes later, since my husband was under the shower and we were planning to go out afterwards. She replied that she was going to go home after cleaning our room, so she just gave me clean towels and water bottles. The room itself has also some defects (such as a broken door hook), but despite our window was right on the street it wasn't as noisy as we were expecting. They also warned us about the noise level on party nights, but we didn't hear anything (we were at 5th floor).  Speaking of party nights: we went on their afterhours on Friday, probably a little too early - a little bit before 1 am just to take advantage of the late happy hour (btw, prices are good during HH and drinks are decent/good) - because the room was almost empty except for a 4 peple group, a man at the counter and a couple of girls. We stayed as long as we could resist the techno music (really not our kind, it also clashed with the gorgeous style of the room) and still the party wasn't starting, so we left thinking of coming back after 1 or 2 hours, but the day had been so long and full for us that  we didn't.  This hotel could be a little better with not so much effort. Still, it's totally worth to spend a couple of nights here!", "Date": "2015-05-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Travis", "ReviewID": "m9U2lyGiARQhVD-E-EbvMA", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Zero stars.  I am currently staying in this hotel, as we speak. While it is rad that there is a new years party, in my hotel. The fact that as a guest, I can't go get a drink in the bar, where I have paid to be a guest, is pretty ridiculous.  After finding out that they would charging me 30 dollars, just to get into the bar to order one drink, I asked if there was a vending machine.  I was told that the only drinks are in the bar, and that I would just have to pay, to be admitted, to buy something to drink in my own hotel!          That, on top of the fact that my ceiling fan shakes so bad that it feels like it will rip off of the ceiling if left on, the TV is tiny and about 15 years old, the door lock is Jimmy Rigged together with a tiny piece of a chain, there was a speck of blood on my sheets when I got to my room,(I bring my own sheets for this reason,) AND the bathroom sink is falling off of the wall. I will admit that this place has a really interesting decor and feel to it, but I will never stay here, ever again.  So damn disappointed.", "Date": "2017-01-01", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Francis", "ReviewID": "Zd5D-cOW30KbCHsvie5Wrg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Sick of doing the big Vegas clubs? Want a more intimate and unique setting? Look no further.  The anti-vegas club. You know LA or NY clubs.. pretentious and in your face. This is exactly the opposite. No cover... boom! I should stop right there... because where in LV is there NO COVER?... But there is more my friends.   The martinis.. oh snap the martinis. Go crazy and try the chocolate martini. It will eff you up. Their martinis are strong and legit. Heck.. any cocktail you buy from the bar is stiff and worth every penny. Drink prices are almost half off from the major clubs.   If you want me to describe the place.. I'll say this. If Kat Von D ever opened up a bar in LA.. this place would be it. Gothic and dark. Art pieces.. mostly classical pieces. No skateboards tho.   SMOKERS:.. they have a huge patio.   MUSIC: They do have DJs,.. depending on the night. Music is very respectable.  I've been here a few times. Usually after dinner. Late night drinks.. cap off that perfect LV night!", "Date": "2011-11-18", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Daniela", "ReviewID": "Zdl2df44FyDe1bHw2f1fGQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "The interior decorations/furnishings are fantastic. I'm a big fan of mid century modern and the Scarface movie so I was in heaven. It doesn't look like much from the outside but it was very quant and personable. The employees were very friendly and the bartender, Jana was awesome.

However, a Hispanic man who parks cars for the hotel was very creepy and inappropriate, asking my girlfriend questions about our relationship when I was away. Shockingly, she didn't leave me for someone working valet service. However, the hotel did lose two customers for the night and moving forward.", "Date": "2016-01-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Kyonz", "ReviewID": "4B-_VHdk4iiFLK0scfZrSQ", "Overall": "2", "Content": "I give this hotel a overall 2 stars and that is strictly because of the bar/nightclub. Every other aspect of the hotel was TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE! We stayed for three nights. Our heat did not work and it took calling the front desk twice before anyone came up to attempt to fix it. The valet was awful. No matter what time we came or left (other than between 12 and 6 a.m.) there was never an attendent at the valet stand. I would have been better off parking my car in the valet area and walking to it myself. No one would have ever known the difference. All of the front desk agents that I came into contact with were rude and very uninformative. I am a Las Vegas local and do not plan on ever staying here again or recommending this facility to any of my friends, family or traveling collegues. Congratulations Artisan hotel on making that money while you could but losing clients in the meantime.", "Date": "2012-11-26", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Megan", "ReviewID": "JFd0ZRW0lQFhcTcDYoaLzw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I can only speak for the bar.  What a cool atmosphere.  It was very dark, there were paintings all over, mirrors on the ceilings, antique looking bookcases with old looking books...There was no cover.  Lucky for me, I had a local who was my tour guide.  We arrived about 3am and danced until 7am, fueled with quite a few vodka and Red Bulls.  Quite a different place, you must try it!

It's too bad really considering it's a nice hotel.  I can't go to the pool any time without annoying DJ music bumping in my eardrum. Get a clue people. Not everyone wants to hear the loud shit you play in the bar till 6am!!!! Also no ice machines. You have to inconveniently go to the bar. And $5 for a drip coffee?? No machines in the room either. No mini bar, no fridge; my room didn't even have an alarm clock. I asked the front desk and they said sorry.

It doesnt look very appealing from the outside but as soon as you walk in its this dark gothic enviroment. they have valet parking since there isnt much of a parking lot .The rooms were clean and not too expensive during the weekdays and a bit pricey during the weekend for being so far from the strip.They have a little lounge downstairs that gets pretty busy on the weekends; the food isnt too great .I ordered steak and it was mostly fat for about $60 bucks.I would recommend this place and would stay here again in the future.I also noticed alot of dancers /strippers seem to stay there too since there is treasures gentlemens club right around the corner and they get a dancer discount .", "Date": "2012-03-02", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Madame", "ReviewID": "jBBq7AMXlYo5MeJOj6UEWA", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Stay away!! 1 star for the really nice accommodating front desk named Kevin. His demeanor is exceptional! I don't know how to start my review but here goes: This place is totally different from other boutique hotel we went to first of all there was no system like the normal hotel or motel you go to. We were checking in & this woman just came besides us to check in too & she can see that there's only 1 person in the front!! Anyway its not the fault of the hotel why this woman is obnoxious & rude! Bottomline I have uploaded pictures to see for yourself.. The rooms stinks like a sewer & most of all they do events up until 8am!! Meaning patty starts at 9pm to 8am then the sounds doesn't stop & you will never ever get a sleep! Since you hear the sounds clearly for the whole time! Rooms are not soundproof! No hairdryer, no alarm clock..worst the bathtub is clogged! Don't shower!!we left as early as we can!!Location is depressing! I don't think I can stay here even if it's free!!No way. Feels like you're sleeping under the bridge! Stinky,Noisy, Gross, Dark & has bunch of weird frames like death inside the room!", "Date": "2016-12-11", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
