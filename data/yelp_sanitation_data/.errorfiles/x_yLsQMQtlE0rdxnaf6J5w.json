My friends, amazed by the huge glasses, decided to split one while I said I'd only have a few sips as I planned to drink later in the night & needed to be the Sober Sally of the party to make sure no one humiliated themselves at dinner.   It's basically your run of the mill Slurpee with alcohol added, but they are pretty delicious. I forget how much the girls paid, but for the huge drink they got, it was definitely worth it. I felt like such a weirdo at dinner, sipping this from the floor, as the glass was so huge it couldn't sit atop our table. They did manage to finish it and planned on saving the plastic glass, but for some unknown reason they talked to some creeper guys on our floor who asked to see it and promptly threw it over the hallway balcony from way up high in the Luxor pyramid.   Overall the drinks are okay and the glasses are novelty (I believe you could even get a bucket? but I could be wrong here), but I'd rather have a classier drink somewhere else.

You make me an alcoholic... :)  It's Vegas = getting drunk everyday. What better way than having a slush full of alcohol? Yes, Fat Tuesday is the way to go. Located in Planet Hollywood, Caesar's Palace, Mandalay Bay and several other locations, you can always find yourself a refill if you need it. Friends and I always get at least two or three refills before the day ends. ;) We usually go with at minimum the Yard Dog or the Monster Yard ($18-$23)- So far we've only had Strawberry, Mango, Hurricane, and Eye Candy... With 5 extra shots. YEAHHHH! Since they're only $1.00 extra-! W0000000T! Quite cheap compared to Minus 5 that charges about $5 per extra shot. So far, the Mango is still my favorite, the Strawberry ended up very hard to finish and the Hurricane is just too strong for my tastes. As goes, Hurricane is the strongest they have as I heard, because it's filled with a bit of everything in it. Kind of got wasted off of it... With that added five shots. ;) I would suggest the Mango if you like it sweet and girly~ :D  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/x_yLsQMQtlE0rdxnaf6J5w?select=RRJ9zvYe_KmDaqiJCzU98g", "Date": "2012-04-02", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "R", "ReviewID": "dXLCSb1EGRORKgCaLZlqTg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "The drinks remind me of 7-11 slurpees...

I always get the $13 yard, and you can come back for refills! Just try not to think about/research the calorie counts, and you'll enjoy this place. The bartenders are always nice, social and funny too. Definitely the best/cheapest place to drink on the strip.   I was very excited for my beloved mudslide, and went to 2 different locations for it, only to be told that it was discontinued and that  everyone still asks about it.

Extra shot of rum comes in a test-tube like in chemistry experiments and it is only $1 Dollar and we added that to our mixer.  I think the total was $15 dollars or so for a refill.

I'm even more surprised I didn't check in there o.O. That tells you I was having too much fun I guess...or I just have bad memory..which is more likely the case :P  True, I went here about 2 months ago but I was just talking to a friend about it yesterday and that reminded me that I still didn't review them.  Anyways, Fat Tuesday daiquiris were the first alcoholic drink I had in Vegas. :D I suppose this review will be for all the ones I visited: Imperial Palace, MGM Grand, and Planet Hollywood. But, I'll try to concentrate on MGM Grand because that's the specific location for this review. The first one I visited was at Imperial Palace because I stayed at that hotel for my first night in Vegas.  I visited Planet Hollywood's location once or twice during that trip and MGM Grand about twice I believe. We were only there for about a week so that sort of tells you how often we went to Fat Tuesdays. My friends and I all shared 3 glasses which we reused over and over again until the 2nd to last day when I decided to buy my own since most of us wanted our own.   I always got Mango, Strawberry, and Pina Colada all mixed together. For $1 more, you can also get a shot of Everclear in it but I can't handle that. I can hardly finish  my glass without the extra alcohol. It may seem sorta pricey but it's not really since you get a slight discount when you recycle the glasses (little humbug though since you have to hold onto it) and unless you are super hardcore, one is usually enough to get your feeling pretty good and it lasts a while too since it's frozen.   I'm too lazy to make multiple reviews..there's really no point I feel because I felt that my service was awesome at all 3 locations that I attended.

Shots of 151 and everclear on top are just $1. It's honestly the best deal going in Vegas. So many people stopped us to ask what we were drinking and where they could get it.

I'm not saying fat tuesday gives you shots of expensive alcohol, but at least tolerable alcohol. I think they use ketel one for vodka (not bad). Although, I think the Octane 190 would have got me effed up within seconds. The best part of this place is that they actually let you sample it so you know what you're buying. Because I don't wanna waste my money on a shit drink. The people working here are always extremely nice and chilled. They even let me sample numerous things before I decided on a drink.
