I tried the Mandarin Orange Tangerine Mimosa. It had extra orange pulp, not too acidic & the champagne doesn't over power the flavors. Perfection!

The Garvey that came with it was the perfect blend to go along the meats, egg, & fried rice.   Almond brioche French toast-- it is very different from any other French toast you're used to. The presentation is pretty darn cool. It was soft but not soggy. You can choose different syrups (almond, coconut, & forgot the other one).   Belgian waffle-- really nothing special about it. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯   The manager came out and apologized for the wait, which I thought was very professional of them.

I guess an employee failed to come in during the busy  Grand Opening . She came to every single table to notify them and also checked up on how everyone and their meals were doing, without being overly bothersome, lol. Of course our server was attentive and friendly as well!  5 STARS to the food!  Items ordered : - White Sangria : if you like strong sangria this is the drink for you. They got me at  papaya  but wasn't a fan, imagined it to be more on the sweet side. - Mandarin Orange Tangerine Mimosa : Absolute FAVE! Glad my friend got it! Sounded too orangey but it's the perfect blend! High class orange juice, with alcohol, with a little bit of pulp!  - Almond Brioche French Toast with Almond Butter & Coconut Syrup (made in house) : DELICIOUS! Three thick pieces, moist and very flavorful! Dusted with powdered sugar, topped with coconut almond custard, and comes with raspberry & mixed tropical fruits.. The Almond Butter and Coconut Syrup were just extra icing on the French toast!  - Belgian Waffles : nothing to special with these waffles, topped with fruit and chose almond butter with maple syrup with it, nonetheless still a good waffle! - 36hr Braised Short Rib Loco Moco topped with Lentil Gravy, comes with Eggs to your liking, Fried Rice, & Crispy Onion Rings : NO KNIFE NEEDED! Extremely tender, seasoned well, great textures with the crispy fried onion, fried egg and fried rice (I think I said  fried  too much lol), and overall a great loco moco!   4 STARS to the long drive out there and the water cup with no ice ¯\_(ツ)_/¯..

Due to the kitchen being backed up and the host telling us we could not be seated for 15 min, we sat at the bar even though plenty of tables were available. First, we ordered the beignets which were burnt and way too crispy. Second, I ordered the crunch salad and my girlfriend ordered the pocho breakfast. 45 min pass and our food has not arrived nor has anyone come over to update us on what's going on. I ask the bartender where our food is and he goes to check. About five minutes later he comes back with my salad but the order is wrong. I asked for dressing on the side and the Gorgonzola cheese on the side. At this point I did not want my salad to be remade so I decided to share my girlfriends dish. Another 10 min pass and my girlfriends dish comes out; strike one for not bringing it out with mine, strike two for it taking an hour when it's a very simple dish, and strike three for it being mediocre. The eggs were extremely runny, hash browns soft except for the crispy edges, and the chicken apple sausage was passable. We would have liked hash brows that were a step up from IHOP or Denny's.   Lastly, the manager is not qualified; she did not know how to handle the situation nor did she present herself as a manger.", "Date": "2014-04-27", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Will", "ReviewID": "JNyqlboiWYt_1xs8YttTAw", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Having frequented the other Bachi property many times before with friends, I had great expectations for this spot.  The decor / atmosphere is cheerful and spotless.  For as lovely as this spot is, I wouldn't call this restaurant a  healthy  life kitchen.  Maybe just a   Life Kitchen .  This matters because we drove 40 minutes to try this restaurant for the  healthy  food.  Although they do include some healthy sounding ingredients into their offerings, nearly all the dishes are empty calorie heavy.  That is not to say the food doesn't taste good, it's just not healthy.  It's a standard breakfast and lunch menu  with clever dish titles, a spot of healthy binders here and there,  arranged nicely on a plate.  That's not healthy.  It's  splendid' to someone who isn't health minded.  Bachi Splendid Life Kitchen.  We based our visit on the photos  from previous posts.  What I figured out after visiting this location, is that some of the yelp photos were taken after the guest reconstructed the dish.  For example, the monty cristo-looking sandwich really doesn't come with preserves inside the sandwich, nor is it served with an even turkey to cheese ratio.  My friend ordered this dish, of which arrived as a dry, boring,  naked monte-cristo type of sandwich (as in no batter, ham and syrup).  It was chewy bread filled with heaps of dry turkey, a tiny bit of cheese on one half, powdered with sugar and served preserves on the side.    Really disappointing.  I scanned other tables and noticed that even those customers were served dishes that were not spectacular.  Nothing that screamed  wow!  what the heck is that .  Everything I saw was beige, brown or white across the plate.  No vibrant appetizing presentations.  Dull.  My friend also ordered a green juice that was described as  fresh pressed  but not organic (per the waitstaff).  We saw a Breville-looking juicer (centrifugal not masticating of which presses) behind the bar (yes, the healthy life kitchen serves liquor), but I can't verify the Breville is what they used to prepare my friend's drink.  Either way, it's not organic.  Healthy people want the pressed organic juice from a masticating juicer and will pay top dollar for it.  I don't know what it is about Vegas and restaurant owners cutting corners, claiming to be healthy.  There is a boat load of money to be made if the food and drink were really prepared correctly with the cleanest ingredients for health minded customers.  I reluctantly ordered the berry iced tea of which had no flavor.", "Date": "2014-04-22", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Cathy", "ReviewID": "q0iViY8jGZohUl1pdGS5LA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "After a morning workout, we checked this place out. In an attempt to eat clean, I was excited to try their ostrich burger - I love ostrich. Their menu includes gluten-free, vegan and vegetarian options. They also have regular menu items. How considerate. They even have Miyagi-San burger from Bachi Burger. What was missing on the menu though was the nutritional info...not even calorie information.  Ostrich Burger:  Ostrich patty with grilled onions, pineapple ketchup, charred tomato and arugula on brioche bun. You can get it cooked medium-well, medium or medium-rare. My medium-rare burger was juicy and tasty. I've had dry ostrich burgers before so, this was real good in my opinion. 4.5/5  Almond Brioche French Toast: Comes with a delish almond butter and coconut syrup on the side and sliced bananas on top. They look and have the same consistency as pancakes. We got a side of Portuguese sausage with this. 4.5/5  Dark Cherry Chocolate Smoothie: I'm a fan of anything cherry and definitely anything chocolate. Good consistency. The chocolate cuts the tartness from the cherries. 4/5  The Nutty Banana: Banana, honey, dates, peanut butter, oats, almond milk and yogurt. This was hard to drink. It was too thick - thicker than a concrete and the taste of peanut butter was overpowering you can't taste the banana. We had to pour water and stir it just so we could finish it. We told the server who checked on us what we thought about this smoothie and he told us that he thinks it needs caramel. Ok... 2/5  The ostrich burger was about $18 and a smoothie is $7.50. I can already hear some Yelpers who would complain about the price. But we were talking about  does healthy eating have to be expensive? This could push people away from eating healthy . I could understand charging $18 for ostrich since you can't just go to the neighborhood store and get ostrich. A $7.50 smoothie though?  The interior is modern and neat. The service was ok. Our server sounded like Louise from  Bob's Burgers  and I was rather amused. I liked the food and I'll be back for more ostrich burger and also try other items.", "Date": "2014-06-08", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "-HEouh3H0IE8QyLsRoSEMA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "As a huge fan of Bachi Burger, I knew I'd be coming here sooner than later. Today was soon enough.  The strip mall is only accessible on Russell. Parking was plentiful at ~1:30 on a Sunday. Inside, the design definitely resembles Bachi 1.0. Not just the sign, but the walls, booth / chair seating, bar area, and TV's definitely make you think of the original location. The lighting is definitely brighter and the lighter wood design is different. Plus, the music is definitely not the ubiquitous electronic dance music of the original. Here, I heard tons of Ingrid Michaelson, Frou Frou, Lily Allen, and other stuff from the 2000's. Surprised that Modest Mouse actually made the rotation.  The menu looked surprisingly big. I later found out that they'd recently added a lot of new items to the menu, which means that fans of Bachi HLK need to come back to check it out. I really wanted to try the french toast that everybody seems to be raving about, but my need for protein led me to pick the Home In The Country scramble ($11.95), which nobody seems to have reviewed. (Yep, just checked and didn't see it.)  Surprise, surprise. I was very impressed by the Home In The Country. The biscuits may not have been fluffy, but they were quite good with the sausage gravy (note: eat them before they grow cold). The scramble with bacon, red pepper, tomato, green onion, cheese, arugula, and avocado was delicious through and through. I especially enjoyed the avocado chunks in there. Finally, the hash browns were nice and crunchy and didn't need such crutches as ketchup or anything. I will say that the saltiness is a little bit high throughout the dish, with relief mostly coming from the avocado (and the glass of water).  I also ordered a starter, but man, that green tea crepe has no business being on anybody's table. The crepe batter itself didn't amount to anything, the cottage cheese barely passes for a filling, and the overall size is puny for $5.95. At least the fruit is fruit. Regardless, I would have much rather had a crepe from Suzuya, my alternate suggestion for this meal. Or a crepe from some mall kiosk. Seriously.  I also tried a couple of bites of some of my friends' orders. The sweet potato fries (complementing someone's sandwich) are a carbon copy of Bachi Burger's. The beets 'n strawberries ($4.95), which may be a new menu item, were a nice starter. Both the yellow beet and the strawberry pieces that I had were fresh and tasty. Finally, and perhaps even more impressive than my own scramble, was the crispy sweet chili chicken and waffles ($15.95). Great crunchy chicken, yummy waffles, and a syrup that has a non-standard sweet origin - possibly honey? I'll probably try that next time if I need my protein.  Green tea crepe aside, Bachi HLK is definitely a solid if pricey brunch spot, and a worthy member of the Bachi empire. I definitely intend to return, hopefully with a slightly larger budget (here's looking at you, ostrich burger).", "Date": "2014-06-01", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Vince", "ReviewID": "XSsDaA7ZKNV34q3nUSuxnA", "Overall": "3", "Content": "I'm a big fan of new things and BHLK brings a lot of that.

Back to the food. I had a pita (have searched the web over for a menu ..can't read most, and the ones I can don't have my sandwich on them.   OK it was a vegan Pita- I think with Hummus, avocado and alfalfa sprouts.  This came sliced in half on a white platter..boring.  I mean Parsley is not that expensive or throw a grape on there or something.  I ordered one of their healthy muffins to-go for late nite snack. What came out was two mini muffins in a to-go box. I don't remember how much that was. I also had iced tea.  Almost $18.00 total.  That is Strip prices  I'm guessing my little Pita was around $11. I think if you tossed a few baby greens or something elso onto the plate to make me think I was getting more value it would help.  I was shocked  they have sandwiches without fries or a substitute side.  I don't really know if the 'Healthy' in their name is reflected in most of the food?  Photos look pretty.

The spinach was a little too garlicky for me. The portion was huge came with asparagus and a side of your choice.  Next time I will pass on the side as it really is a generous amount of food.  My husband had the chicken pecan salad, and had ordered a starter of beets and strawberries. The sandwich arrived before the starter.

A very flavorful stack of four brioche rounds, wonderfully soft and flavored nicely with almond.  On top of the stack were some banana slices and the plate had some small pieces of chopped kiwi and mango.  The plating was very nicely done.  I had a choice of three syrups and I went with the coconut syrup.  You also have the choice of getting whipped cream which I opted for.  Along the the whipped cream and the syrup comes a small container of almond butter which is very rich and very tasty!  Service was excellent.  Well, you'd expect it to be!  I was the only person in the place who wasn't an employee.    I really like the decor.  Modern with lots of wood.

We were going to try out Mr. Mama's,  but they were closed and we're just going go drive over to the Cracked Egg, Egg & I, or something similar.  As I was driving up Russell, I looked over and saw Bachi HLK and we decided to head there instead. I guess the word isn't out yet that this place has delicious food because there were only two other tables with customers besides ours. I was surprised that they weren't busy for Easter brunch.  Kinda stinks for them, but awesome for me and my family.  They've only been open for about a week or so.   We were promptly seated, of course, by our server Matt. He gave us our menus and explained a few things in the menu to us.  He came back with waters for us to drink and took our additional drink order as well as appetizers. Hubs and daughter shared the beignets. The menu has so many delicious dishes on it that it took us a little longer to figure out what we wanted. I was torn between the 36 hour short rib loco moco or the shrimp and grits. I asked Matt and he suggested the loco moco. Hubs got the flaxseed coconut pancakes and our daughter got the waffle.   Our food came out soon after we ordered. The waffle and pancakes come with your choice of whipped butter or almond butter. You also get a choice of syrups. They have maple,  coconut and blueberry. Hubs chose the whipped butter and maple. Daughter chose almond butter and maple. The pancakes were a decent size and came as a 3 stack. The waffle was the size of a plate. They both enjoyed their choices.  What can I say about my short rib loco moco?  It was so delicious!  It came with 2 eggs (over easy as Matt suggested), fried rice, orange lentil gravy and the short rib. Matt gave me a steak knife for the short rib, but I didn't need it. The short rib was so tender. I used my fork to break it apart. The fried rice was good and the eggs were cooked perfectly. The orange lentil gravy is different from the typical loco moco brown gravy,  but was a refreshing change. The gravy had orange lentils in it and was reminiscent of bbq baked beans, but not as thick. I mixed the egg, rice, gravy and a piece of meat together. I could still taste everything separately,  but it all worked well together.   Service was stellar. Matt didn't hover, but checked on us a couple times during our meal. The manager came to our table to talk with us and give us a to go menu as well.  We will definitely be back.

Idk if they plan on having A1 in the future but as of today they did not have any.  My husband had the Count meet Bachi HLK and he was not a fan of it!  Other then there being no steak sauce for my steak the only other downfall was being charged the wrong amount.  However, once I brought it to the servers attention she promptly voided out the charge to my credit card and re-ran my card for the correct amount.

Located on West Russell in one of Spring Valley's several strip malls and officially open 8a-4p seven days a week my arrival at Bachi HLK was greeted by the smell of fresh oranges being squeezed at the room-length open bar and soon finding smiling service from a young man named Brent I was offered my choice of seats - an exquisite experience amongst elegant blonde woods and an open floor plan marred only by slightly-too-loud pop music during my hour long solo visit.   Featuring all all-day menu spanning appetizers and eggs to griddles, sandwiches, and salads it was to a veritable who's who of personal favorites that I found myself tempted and opting for a trio even at the early hour of 8am the meal started with a bang, a creamy 2.5oz torchon of foie gras every bit on par with that at Bouchon but with better bread and house-made jam for $5 less.  Already smiling as I tended to my liver it was at my request that the next plate was fired in the open kitchen and arriving with cheese still bulbbling the HLK take on a Monte Cristo was truly divine as briny bird with a hint of smoke found new light in aged gruyere while supple griddled brioche dusted with powdered sugar provided an eggy canvas for thick jam, some already onboard and more on the side.  At this point sated but curiosity not yet satisfied it was with a bit of indecision that I sorted between pancakes, beignets, banana bread, and chicken on waffles but going with my instincts the final plate of the morning would prove the bet of the trio; a six stack of almond-coated custard rounds rousing the flavors of a pina colada only to be bolstered by a trio of all-natural syrups plus whipped cream and salted butter; the comparison again to Thomas Keller's work on-strip with the  bread pudding style , but Bachi's more subtle and texturally appealing - a strong bit of praise considering the accolades and Michelin Stars garnered by the former.", "Date": "2014-04-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jenny", "ReviewID": "gU730aAxOZbtmGBSjmbcCQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "So I am ADDICTED .....

It was very Chic and elegant, the music was modern and played many of my Favorite songs =) I dislike dining in boring areas. The staff seemed a bit nervous but overall they were super nice, helpful and prompt with refills!  No one likes empty glasses more then I do.   My daughter had the Kids meal with Bacon, Eggs, potatoes and Fresh Fruit.  I had the Surf n Turf Eggs Benedict I totally went off my usual Carnivorous Nature which told me to get the Loco Moco with that 36 hour braised short rib... It came with a Dill Hollandaise sauce on top of a Perfectly Poached egg billowing on a mound of Smoked Turkey and Smoked Salmon.  The Sweetness of the Red Onion and the most Delicious Sweet Tomatoes I  have ever eaten cut right through the richness creating a perfect harmony of flavors in my mouth!      My friend got the Strawberry Banana Ricotta Pancakes, 3 huge pancakes, I had to have a taste and lets just say the next time I go in, I may have to have those as well =)  P.S.  THEY HAVE THE MOST DELICIOUS FRESHLY MADE ORANGE JUICE YOU WILL EVER TASTE!!! Trust me get it!   I cannot wait to take more friends and show off the new breakfast/lunch eatery in my neighborhood.

After reading all the positive reviews on Yelp, decided to give it a try, last Sunday around 2:30pm.   The quality of the food was good, the prices are a little high. But what isn't these days. The problem I had was with the service. First the waitress couldn't tell my wife what was on the Miyagi burger. So my wife decides on the short rib and I had the pocho breakfast. The waitress asks my wife how she wants her eggs cooked but doesn't ask me.   Once the food was brought out, my wife requested additional napkins, which were never brought out. We didn't see the waitress again until 20 minutes later. She didn't stop by to ask if everything was ok, or if we needed refills on our drinks. She was behind the bar, doing whatever she was doing. Finally a different waitress stopped by with our check.   While we were eating, a lady came into the restaurant, and waited by the reception area, which no one was at. She read the menu for 10 minutes, and when no one showed up to seat her, she finally gave up and left.   Maybe they were just having a bad day. But the restaurant was only about 1/4 full.

I want to note that the place is small and there were several servers during lunch time.  The place was not that busy as well.  When we came in and was seated, it took the server 10 minutes to come and get our order. We ordered a Monte Cristo with a side salad and Oxtail Chili Scramble. When my bf asked if he can get the eggs cooked in a different way, the server immediately just said no. He didn't even say that he will ask the chef.   So the food finally came after 25 minutes. The server brought out the plate of Monte Cristo and Oxtail Chili Scramble. After a few minutes the server brought out the side salad and a container of sauce. Since both salad and the sauce came together, I assumed that it was a salad dressing and put it on the salad.  When I asked for an extra dressing, the server said that it was a jam for the Monte Cristo (Oh thanks for making me look stupid). They did offer a salad replacement but since I was pissed, I just said never mind. I didn't eat the salad since it tasted funky with the jam.   Both dishes were not bad (that's what the 2 stars are for). The Monte Cristo came with sweet potato fries and it's exactly the same taste as Bachi Burger's sweet potato fries with yuzu aioli sauce.   When we were done, my bf asked for a box. We waited, and waited... After 10 minutes another server came and asked if we need anything else, so we said we need a box. Finally she brought it out.

Service was great and I love that they offer a variety of condiments (jelly, butters and syrups).  We ordered:  Beignets with guava jelly - jelly is more of a purée but flavor is excellent. Beignets were light and airy on the inside, although not a lot of flavor without the jelly.  Mango bread - good, but wished the mango flavor was stronger. Added guava jelly to it and it worked well together.  Short rib loco moco - saw it was popular in other yelp reviews so wanted to give it a try. Overall - very good. Supposedly braised for 36 hrs, but surprisingly not as tender as I expected. Fried rice and gravy were both flavorful. Little pricey at $20 though.  Strawberry banana ricotta pancakes - also very good, but after eating all of the above, we only finished about 1/3. Four large pancakes with bananas and strawberries on top.

NO. NO WAY! Delicious? Yes!!!  Stopped by today with my wife for what was supposed to be a light and healthy lunch. We are huge fans of Bachi Burger and had big expectations for HLK.

Looking over the extensive menu, I noticed that most of the dishes have healthy ingredients but the way they are prepared aren't low calorie and aren't low fat.  I'm sure there are some exceptions but for the most part, healthy is not what I would describe their food as.   As the  healthy  options were limited, I decided to take this as an opportunity for a cheat meal. I ordered the chicken and waffles, and my wife got the short rib loco moco.  We ended up sharing both dishes. Presentation was excellent. Both dishes tasted good, but didn't blow my mind like Bachi Burger did when they first opened.  The chicken and waffles came with a side of brussel sprouts which was really good. The short rib in the loco moco was so tender, you didn't even need a knife. And the gravy/sauce that was smothered over the short rib was delicious. The waffles were really tasty too and was served w/ a trio of whipped butter, almond butter, and syrup. The chicken had a spicy chili sauce on top of it, and overall the chicken and waffle dish was a success.   Price: EXPENSIVE.  Ambiance: Cool, clean, and modern.  Service: The server seemed a little nervous and flustered. She did check in on us throughout the meal, maybe a little too much though.

What piqued my interest was solely the green tea crepe with yuzu syrup, as I had bypassed ordering the green tea crepe on my recent trip to Takahashi Bakery in NYC.  Upon arrival (at around 9:30 AM), we were seated away from the wind-tunnel door (thanks to LV's 60 mph winds).  I ordered a strawberry-mango mimosa and Eric R. got the Bachi 20, the house bloody mary.  The drinks were great.  The menu is full of items difficult to choose from.  Though I was committed to the green tea crepe and Eric R. to the flaxseed blueberry coconut pancakes thanks to Ardie's review, we both narrowed our eyes upon the Wake It Up scramble which appeared to be chock-full of a delicious combination of ingredients.  Being gluttonous, I ordered the green tea crepe as a starter (as it is listed on the menu) and then the scramble to share with Eric R. despite his order of pancakes.  I selected the breakfast potatoes as my side to the scramble, but hash browns and fresh fruit are other options.  The server assured us the crepe would come out first.  Fast forward a short time and our entrees came out before the crepe.  I was not too concerned and also impressed at how speedy the dishes arrived.  We had a straight view to the kitchen from our booth and it looked busy and clean.  While we started eating, a large crowd of people gathered both inside and outside of the door waiting for a table.  The server came by and asked if I still wanted the crepe, to which I emphatically answered,  Yes!   I came for that crepe and I will not leave without eating it!  The scramble was surprisingly delicious (as I am not usually a scrambled egg fan compared to other methods of egg preparation).  It had huge cloves of roasted garlic, a really nice touch, chopped wild mushrooms, avocado, gruyere, sundried tomatoes, green onions, and arugula.  The breakfast potatoes were roasted fingerlings and purple potatoes with onions and herbs.  The green tea crepe finally arrived, cut in half and displayed in the middle of the plate.  It was stuffed with cottage cheese and berry compote, garnished with the yuzu syrup and fresh berries.  The yuzu syrup is the star on this plate.  The crepe is served cold and the batter was thick.  I have never been too much of a cottage cheese fan but really wanted to try the rest.  I think a sweetened ricotta may be a better fit, but I don't make sweets so I could be wrong.  The yuzu syrup had yuzu rind in it and was perfect.  When Eric R. ordered his pancakes he had a choice between maple, blueberry, or coconut syrups.  The blueberry and coconut are house-made.  He also had a choice between whipped butter, almond butter, and whipped cream.  Additional sides of these are 50 cents each, like additional sauces at Bachi Burger are.  He got blueberry syrup and whipped butter, and had enough pancakes to take some home.  No yuzu syrup is available for pancakes (at least not listed) probably due to the expense.  There are a lot of great items on the menu (including the salads, with yuzu vinaigrette, beets, frisee, mache, and other cool ingredients) so I would like to return, but due to the location I am unlikely to be a regular visitor.

It has a pretty thick layer of duck fat on top as well. Yeah, as disgusting as you may feel thinking about eating straight up fat, who cares? Spread that stuff on!

No, not all too myself, I'm not that much of a fatty. Disappointed a bit, because none of us were asked how we wanted our eggs cooked. On both hashes they came over hard, which I hate. I love runny yolks, don't take that away from me! Especially on a hash. But other than that, they were both delicious. Corned beef had good flavor.

Ordered the Bachi Fish as I have had a friend order that at the original Bachi location (Windmill) & had old me it was delicious. I recall that it had a bit of a coating on it that helped keep the fish together. My fish on this day was good but it was so messy it ended up all over my hands & breaking a part every bite that I tried to take. I eventually gave up & cut it up bun & all & ate it with a knife & fork. Also ordered a side order of the sweet potato fries which were good but I forget what sauce come with them - it's ok. But the green sauce that came with my coworkers Lonely Bird sandwich was much better I thought. I asked for that & was told I couldn't have it because it didn't come with the fries. Ok strike one...never tell the customer they can't have a sauce. Other coworkers ordered the Wake up Scramble & they said it was good & liked it. On to service: seemed to be great in the beginning of sitting down but as time wore on it got worse. It took over 30 minutes to get our food when we were the only 4 in the place besides the workers. Had 2 different waitresses tell us that our food would be right out. Finally had to tell them that we needed to get back to work so it needed to come out soon. Strike 2. Also saw one of the cooks in the kitchen lick their fingers with a plastic glove on & then go back to preparing food. Gross! Strike 3.

I like the original Bachi better & usually go for a burger anyway.", "Date": "2014-04-29", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "C", "ReviewID": "PGnKb96NCRVMqshI6lFgKA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "We flew to Vegas for a friend's bday but rented a car only because we wanted to try Bachi Burger.  Instead, we decided to try Bachi HLK for breakfast.  The Bella Farms Foie Gras de canard was delicious!!! I want it shipped to me in Cali!!  We also tried the taro haupia pancakes and the crispy chili chicken and waffles.  Everything was delicious.  The bummer is that we were too full to try Bachi Burger.", "Date": "2014-06-08", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Chelsey", "ReviewID": "mdJMPZ2NqAc78Uf-xjFd6A", "Overall": "2", "Content": "First time the food was good but the service was so slow. The second time the service was still slow but then they were out of some of the juices we wanted. We figured we would go back a third time and even joked on the way there about them running out of items. This time not only was the service lacking but they were out of all of their fresh juices and the majority of their salads. It was 11:30 in morning and I couldn't believe they were out of so much. When our salads finally came the chicken was so hard it seemed old. They had also messed up my friends order. When we told the waitress our concerns and we were unhappy she brought the check then disappeared. We didn't even eat the lunch and payed a $60 tab. So disappointing we will never go back. Too bad because I was excited for a new healthy food spot.", "Date": "2014-06-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Cher", "ReviewID": "PVnCLo0VwIjKAEi35wtamw", "Overall": "3", "Content": "had the chicken with waffles. chicken was bit dry and not flavorful at all. the waffles were so so.. nothing spectacular.   i love the brussels sprouts side dish ...sooo yummy! i just wished the zest infused in this dish was as good as the chicken!  will i come back??? sure thing. i want to try their other dishes.", "Date": "2014-04-21", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jean", "ReviewID": "Yzegcf8vrIyc-JEHY5IPTg", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Started off the morning with fresh squeezed OJ, I must point out it was the bomb! Their OJ is notably very good. My friend ordered the dulce latte, also very good. The server didn't appear to be very knowledgeable or very attentive. I ordered strawberry banana ricotta pancakes with side of HLK potatoes, 2 eggs, & sausage. My friend had the loch duarte salmon in which my friend mistakenly thought it was salmon lox. We thought we confirmed with the server that it was a lox but it turns out to be pan seared salmon oopsies! It was quite bit of surprise when the salmon came out. My eggs came out first then 6 minutes later my pancakes and sausages arrived. I guess my potatoes were never placed through. The portion sizes of everything were pretty big. The pancakes were soft and succulent complimented with coconut syrup. For a side order of sausages it came with 3!!! The salmon was decent over a bed of grilled veggies. Ultimately, the food isn't anything mind blowing, the service could definitely use improvement and delivery of time could use a little bit of help as well. I should've been advised of the chefs specials before I placed my order but I noticed on my own in the back of the restaurant on a board.", "Date": "2014-05-07", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jason", "ReviewID": "gyJkOqHRZzGS35bdxx7Z7A", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I love Bachi Healthy Life kitchen!

The food we ordered looked and tasted good, but my experience was horrific. My son is highly allergic to peanuts/nuts. I told the server my son is highly allergic to peanuts and asked what type of oil they fried in. She came back and said soybean oil. My son ordered the chicken and waffles which on the menu didn't say anything about having nuts or peanuts in it. My son ate one piece of chicken, started coughing, stopped eating and asked for a Benadryl. I asked our server again if there was any nuts in that dish. She went back to ask the kitchen, came back to me and apologized that in fact the chicken batter had peanut butter in it. I was appalled, flabbergasted and angry. The staff should know all ingredients in the entrees. The kitchen should have known to tell the server which dishes contain hidden ingredients. I've been to many restaurants who do fry in peanut oil and ones that don't and the staff is able to tell us which entrees can be ordered for customers with such an allergy. Some people think a peanut allergy is nothing, but it is in fact deadly when anaphylaxis is the result of ingesting peanuts/nuts. I was lucky that my son had a mild reaction, but it could have been worse. Thank goodness I always bring Benadryl and his epipen and that the ER was just across the street.  Although the staff was very apologetic, it didn't take away the fear that I had for my son going through an allergic reaction which could have been prevented with full knowledge of the menu and all ingredients in the entrees. Unfortunately we didn't get to enjoy our food and I don't think I will be back. We had to rush out of there to take my son to the ER.", "Date": "2014-06-05", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Drew", "ReviewID": "kyO81b6fY-hVdY3VebcPDw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Bachi HLK has a unique menu with lots of healthy and interesting items. We ordered an egg frittata, a beets/strawberry starter, two cold-pressed juices, and a cod fish sandwich with sweet potato fries. The prices weren't very high, although $7.50 for the 8 ounces of cold-pressed juice was more than we would usually pay. The food was delicious and the portions were on the larger size, especially the egg frittata which came with a side of fruit and bread.   The atomosphere was casual and laid back. It also wasn't crowded, which was nice considering it was a Sunday. The layout contains open floor space with a view of the kitchen and the restaurant was very clean. The design is organic (lots of light colored wood). There were 3 televisions with various food network shows playing. Service from the staff was attentive and enjoyable.

We, party of 2, were told to wait a few minutes for them to clean up and we would be seated shortly. We waited happily. We have good experience with bachi burger before (the one in Windmill) so we have no problem with the wait. 5 mins later, a server carried some drinks to the table next to where I sat waiting spilt her drinks all over. Didn't splash me. But we can see the unprofessionalism. Here we continued to wait, thinking the place is still new, They still need time for improvement. 20 mins later, we were still waiting. I should repeat: there are lots of empty tables but still no one bothered to clean up or make sure we got seated. My bf stood up and saw if he could catch anyones attention to ask what was going on. Still, the servers seemed too busy. I guess we didn't worth their time. Feeling upset, we left. We should come to the old location. Thought we could give it a shot.
