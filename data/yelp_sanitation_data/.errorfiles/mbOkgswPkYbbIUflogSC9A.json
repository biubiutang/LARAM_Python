First of all, it's supposed to be hard to find  bad  sushi. After all, if the fish is fresh the only factor left should be the rice - or so at least that was my perception until recently.   As it turns out, bad sushi has little to do with the freshness of the fish. Bad sushi is a product of bad management.  Nagoya is good example of  bad  sushi, simply due to the fact that management has decided that several of the factors that make up a good sushi bar are too expensive to offer. I understand that offering AYCE can be a financial concern, so I expect that some types of sushi are going to be offered on a  one per visit  or  dinner price only  basis, as many places around town will do. But what I cannot forgive, is not stocking those items at all.  During my visit to Nagoya, there were several of my favorite sushi offerings that were simply not available; some are not even stocked on a regular basis. So even though I was willing to pay extra for the sea urchin, there was none to be had.   And to add insult to injury, the salmon roe was not fresh (it was actually very nasty) AND they do not carry quail eggs - what?. The chef said they do not carry quail eggs (which are an essential compliment to the salmon roe and sea urchin) because they do not get enough call for it. Well I've been to the 168 market and I know that a dozen quail eggs is extremely cheap - so I say that's a crappy excuse, but one I expect from a crappy sushi bar.  Just to note: the sushi chef was actually great. It's just too bad he has so little to work with.", "Date": "2012-04-17", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Belle", "ReviewID": "cw4BBpitLRE4SxPu-JKU1w", "Overall": "2", "Content": "With all the gazillion Japanese restaurants to choose from here in Vegas, this one isn't the cream of the crop.

After I've had my fix, I'll start to explore the menu for other yummy things.   Now, although not everything I have ordered from Nagoya was good (there are a few rolls I am not a fan of) for the most part, I know what my taste buds enjoy, and try to stick to what is in the range of that. For instance, ordered a Nato roll once. That was a huge mistake, and I really think it was Nagoya's fault, I should have known I would not like fermented beans. My mistake. I had a burrito roll (not sure if that's the real name) but I found out I don't like deep fried rolls (too much rice). Now, anywhere I visit for sushi, I don't order things like that.   Over the years, I have noticed that, with sushi becoming more popular and more sushi places opening up around town and stepping their game up, Nagoya has been less busy than when I first started going there.  Sometimes I would go in for dinner, and be the only table in the place, however, it's always satisfying. The price is reasonable as well.  --  Went there just recently, and I am not sure if it was because there was a new sushi chef or what, but I was a little disappointed with the quality of the sushi (especially my screaming o) It just didn't do it for me; I've noticed the difference the past couple of times we ate here.", "Date": "2013-01-11", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Tina", "ReviewID": "GEWUZOvsjIXlqXJ2rSuTUA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Love this place for their lunch specials & green tea tempura ice cream.

At first I thought it was novel that the restaurant would make everything to order (and it is) however getting whole rolls limits you because you can really only eat so much. The rolls were really just average at best. There were no  stand outs .  But just an example of one disappointment - I ordered a roll that sounded good with soft shell crab in it, I think it was called the Red Bull. I have been eating sushi for over 20 years and softshell crabs for over 35 years. I know it when I see it. There was simply nothing more than minced crab stick in the roll.. When I asked about it the lady  assured  me that it was soft crab but the chef chops it up for the roll. Huh? It was not good at all. out of 4 rolls I ordered only one was really any good. Not to mention their rules that you have to eat all of what you order - no wasting the rice or you will be surcharged. Their sushi pieces had way too much rice (which is obviously their goal to fill you with rice).  Honestly... don't do it. If you know good sushi you will be soarly disappointed.   In all honesty I can't speak for the rest of the options on the AYCE menu, why fill-up on noodles when you can order sushi.", "Date": "2010-06-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Abraham", "ReviewID": "jBWBK6TPPGOukOUl-Ntyyg", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Never coming back! :-(  this is my review..

I begin with shrimp tempura and calamari tempura appetizers. Too much breading. Almost more breading than seafood. My next order was salmon and eel nigiri. Not bad.

The udon itself was good, but the shrimp had so much breading that wasn't fully cooked that I just felt sick after eating all the above (we only ordered 4 different nigris).

This is my 3rd time here.  1st time was well over a year ago for AYCE, then a few weeks ago for a lunch take out special (which was horrible) But I figured maybe I mis judged them and I should try the AYCE again.   So.... I walked in and there were about 8 other people there (not too busy). Hell I was surprised to even see that many actually.  They have 2 chef's behind the counter and I'm waiting patiently and I finally place my order. They typically stuff their rolls FULL of too much rice, so my first order was small just in case.  To my surprise it was a normal amount. I was beginning to think that they may have changed their ways.  The sushi chefs were a bit slow and I caught on pretty quickly that this was going to be a problem, because a saw a party of 4 walk in, then a few other small parties and a few people also sat down at the sushi bar.  For most places, this is great and I'm always glad to see that people are coming in, but the sushi chefs here were already so slow, now what are they going to do.  Well it took forever to get my next few orders and I started to see why. They were very detailed with some of the orders and I don't mind that, but ONLY if you can do that and do it quickly.  Other orders were SOOOO skimpy.  I enjoyed their sex on the beach roll but it's topped with slices of salmon.  The salmon slice didn't even cover the top of each piece of sushi, it was also incredibly thin, and part of the roll wasn't even cut into pieces.   All in all their quality was fairly good and I enjoyed my handrolls very much but I somehow knew this was gonna happen as it often happens at mediocre places like this.. I order my uni and sweet shrimp  oh I'm sorry we're out   I WAS PISSED!!!! and it was on a Wednesday TOO.  (I happen to know that Tuesday and Wednesday are the best days for sushi because of the fish markets in asia, so there was NO reason to be out of it) once again they most likely didn't want to serve it as part of the all you can eat.  What's sad is this place has GREAT potential, and you can easily see that from the menu, the variety of rolls and even the sushi chefs. At one point I wanted to stand up and shout out how easily they are making this a bad place and it doesn't have to be.  All they have to do is work faster MAYBE put a 3rd sushi chef on, and don't be so skimpy with their fish. I understand cost and not over doing it either but don't be skimpy. There are PLENTY of other great AYCE sushi places that don't skimp at all.  This place is very very borderline  about coming back for a return visit.  I typically eat in 45 min I was there approx 1 hr 20 min.  That is just TOO long for just goin by myself.    Work on your speed Nagoya. Guests were comin in the door to give you a chance and you're blowing it and yet you have great potential.", "Date": "2012-03-23", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
