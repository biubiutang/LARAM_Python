When I first moved here, I was sad and lost, fearlful I would never have a tasty burger again, fearful that all Las Vegas had to offer besides standard burgers was that disgusting In&Out. Seriously, people LIKE that crap? Luckily, I found out while driving to visit friends that there is one on the other side of town. I am sad to admit that when they ask me to come visit, I think, oh, an excuse to go to checkers! Yay!  And then, you wait... forever... to get that tasty burger and fries..

We saw a banner for 2 chicken sandwiches for $6 while we drove by and saw the word combo too, very misleading if you ate driving by. So we went drive thru and ordered the special for chicken sandwiches and were told it was $10.81, we get to the window and the lady says 12.97 and my fiance asked why the price changes and she said 'oh because the other register charges wrong' my fiance said well shouldnt you honor the $10.81?? She said with a smart remark  do you want two combos or not  we said yes, she then answered well pay $12.97 that's when my fiance became a smart ass and said we want them for the price you told UA at the speaker, your machine making a mistake isn't my fault. She slammed the window and went to take a picture of the banner and said  look its $6/per combo you want it or not??? We asked for a manager and she said she was in charge.. We said we aren't moving until we get our price. She called corporate to ask for an override and said very rudely she wouldn't do it !!!! She went outside the drive thru and took a pic of our plates !!! We moved to avoid the cars behind having problems but this cashier Liz was a terrible person.

Checkers is really just another hamburger stand. I like the idea it is shaped like a bus, which is cool. The twisty turns and maneuvers you must navigate are not fun. The dual drive up windows caught us by surprise.  Our daughter said we should try it and so we did, by the way that usually means buy us something while you're there. So here is how my order went and what it cost. Big Buford combo (med), the medium refers to the drink and quantity of fries; with a substitute of Banana shake for the drink, one bacon cheese burger combo deals (med), and one bacon, cheese hamburger and fries (med), no drink, and finally a Cheese burger combo (med) with a substitute Vanilla Shake. The total $26.21, that was for four people and basic meals. Here is something to remember the cost of the bacon cheese burger and fries cost only .30 less that the combo. In the case that a combo saves money, here it does. Make sure that you ask for drink carriers and napkins because if you don't ask your will not receive.  The fries have a seasoning on them and they are a little crunchy, they don't offer any fry sauce, the hamburgers are small in comparison with the quarter pounders, however they taste pretty good. The milk shake I had was vanilla and it taste good and wasn't over powering. Our children didn't complain about their food and my wife likes the fries. So we might try it again.  The survey on the back of the receipt will get you a free cheese burger, so if you think of trying it again do the survey.", "Date": "2011-07-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Lisa", "ReviewID": "odyJYUOj-yqhg3-BHir6-g", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Worst experience and customer service EVER.

The wings and the onion rings were the highlight, though their fries weren't bad. The seasoning is better than some of the big name places, but the fries arent consistent in crispness/freshness. Since the first trip, we've gone back solely for the wings and ordered them in large numbers. The benefit in so doing is that they're guaranteed to not have 40 wings precooked and sitting around under a lamp- you can watch them fry up a 'fresh' batch while waiting at the drive through. The first time I went we got one or two ranches kudos to enjoy with the wings, after that they gave us one and told us it'd be 42 cents for each additional packet. The last two-three times we've gone we didn't receive any ranch despite our large orders. I'm not sure what their policy is regarding their ranch distribution, but shouldnt 40 hot wings get at least 1 little packet? Its also obvious that when interacting with the workers, they aren't particularly enthusiastic. The sandwiches were subpar and the inconsistencies about something as silly as a couple of ranch packets [2 free with an order of 20 wings and then 0 ranch with 40 wings + attitude?] is irritating. There's also a timer inside the restaurant trying to ensure that the food doesn't take too long- when it goes off, there have been several times that the servers would ask me to pull back and re-position my car in the awkward little drive through in order to stop the beeping.  The angry buffalo sauce is our favorite and the cheap wings are the reason to go back, but it's not much different from any other chain restaurant otherwise.", "Date": "2010-06-13", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Cameron", "ReviewID": "VRqTSPG7hOvo-2fOiyqN8g", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Came here starving on a Saturday for lunch.

Lookin to fill me belly with that Rally's, bullish!t, pull sh!t off like it was supposed to be pulled ...  Checkers/Rallys is much like In-N-Out burger without an inside to dine in. It is drive thru only. But they have some of the best burgers IMO. Their fries are hit or miss though.  If you want a good burger, here are my top(s): 1. Butcher Block -- They make their own 100% beef patties with signature BBQ sauce. You have to take it home and cook it yourself, but these were the bet burgers I've ever had. Top it off with some cheddar cheese. HUGE patties... not too big, not too small 2. Cheeburger Cheeburger -- Huge burgers in different size. I don't care too much for the buns because I feel they are too big. Tons of toppings and OTHER great foods to go with it 3. Checkers/Rallys -- love that taste and it brings back memories. My only problem is that there is only one of these places and it's all the way across town in tweakerville (a/k/a Boulder Hwy.) 4. In-n-out burger -- better than fast food like McDonald's or Burger King... but nothing to write home about  If I'm ever on Boulder Hwy., which is super rare, I will always stop by Checkers/Rallys", "Date": "2014-07-29", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ericka", "ReviewID": "5i6Mbs4B_1q2hbNnrHBI8g", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I decided I must review after reading all the bad ones on here.  I live right by this place and waited far to long to try them.  It took a couple times of going there to get what we really wanted but now that I know what's up - maybe I can help future burger lovers.  Checkers has many low price options but it is by far not a cheap place.  The first time we ordered two bacon doubles in a patty melt they had advertised two for $6.  That burger remains the best deal for the money and it was great.  We tried the two bacon double crisps for $4 and they were not great at all.  Still fresh and hot, though.  While we were waiting in line for that order (yes - they take a while - but everything is always fresh) we stared at this picture they have on the window of a lovely bacon cheese burger - thinking it was what we ordered - far from it.  So the next time we asked for that burger on the picture - the lady told us it was a double bacon double cheese - ok - we ordered two.  I confirmed when we got to the window and a different lady told us - no, it was actually a baconzilla. So, yet again, we left with burgers we didn't really want - but they were actually delicious.  We finally  went back for the baconzilla - and that is one of the best fast food burgers I have ever had.  Unreal.  I mean the name of it alone is appetizing. (Or frightening, depending on perspective, I guess)  The fries are off the hook but expensive and small portioned - I highly recommend the loaded versions.

Finally got a chance to check it out. It's one of those Sonic Burger type of places where there's no indoor dining room and as always, that's not a good thing in Vegas. As I always say, it's either too hot, too cold or too windy. In this case it was too windy.   They also have the walk up window, which is what I did, and they also have an outside dining area with the circular picnic-like tables. They offer pretty standard American fast food. The menu had sections for burgers, chicken sandwiches, chicken wings, hot dogs and a few miscellaneous items. In this case I ordered the  Champ  burger with cheese combo. I think it was the #3. Just a standard burger, drink and fries combo. As I ordered, I was the only person in line but very soon a group built up and I noticed a slight problem. As you can see from one of the pictures of the front. There pretty much a sidewalk worth of space for where you order. Right behind that, cars pass through. Now when the group started building up, I found my self trying to find a spot to stand to wait for my order. I just found that to be a pretty bad layout because the seating area is to the side of the store and the pick up window is in the front, not only that but it's the window further away from the seating area. It wasn't that big of a deal but it's just not an ideal layout.      My order was ready within about 5 minutes or so, so it wasn't to much of a deal.      I got my burger and went to the seating area. It has a pretty neat sound system where you can't really hear it from anywhere else but in that area, but the music was kind of odd. I swear the theme music for the Spice Channel was playing. It was that one song where there's like chanting monks in the back ground with the little hip hop drum beat over it. How the hell did they even find that song! Anyway, back to the food.      The first thing I noticed was the fries. The fries were more like the potato wedges at KFC but cut like a regular sized fry. They were good but I didn't get ketchup, and they really needed ketchup. The burger wasn't that great, not bad but nothing special. It tasted like a Wendy's burger. There seemed to be a lot of signs for their chicken wings so I think I should have checked those out. For what I bought, I thought it was good but nothing I would go out of my way for. Especially, if you plan on eating there.      As I said, it was windy outside and it was to the point where I had to put my drink on the wrapper of my burger and I had to keep my fries in the bag  and hold them the whole time because it was so windy. Can't really speak for the rest of the menu but the combo I ordered was good but nothing spectacular.      One thing I found funny though was the bag. It had this  anonymous chicken posse  thing and it's a bunch of chickens saying that if if you don't have 20 pieces of wings then you can't hang with us... Why would chickens want to hang with people that have just their wings! Are they cannibals?

In-N-Out Burger, Fatburger, and all other fast-food burger joints in Las #Vegas.

If we had to pay full price for the food we probably would have felt shorted.  The small fries were small.  The sandwiches had a decent proportions for the price we paid.  The quality and taste of the food was about par for a good fast food joint.  The fries smelled like they were fried in the same vat as the fish but this was not reflected in the taste.

We ordered 2 meals; 2 burgers, 2 medium fries, 1 med soda, 1 med shake came out to just under $15.   Burgers:  I was a little disappointed by the size of my burger after I paid. Smaller than an In n Out burger. My boyfriend's burger had REAL bacon, he felt it much better than any other fast food bacon he's had. So, other than the bacon, the burgers were just okay. ORDER THE BACON.  Fries:  The fries were good, but as Jason describes  the drink to fry ratio was whack . The medium drink was quite large and the fries were a moderate size. Don't plan on sharing fries.  Drinks: They serve Cherry Coke, which Jason loved. It's not a typical find in a fast food place. I had the banana milkshake, which was good- just as I expected. Nothing over the top. No whip or cherry but I don't feel that took away from it.   Overall, I wouldn't plan any special trips out here.

Eating them is a cheap habit you hide from your friends and family but you just. can't. stop.  Thankfully, I live nowhere near this location (or any others)- service here is surprisingly friendly but Jesus Christ, they need to lower the volume on the drive-up window. I'm pretty sure you can hear everything being said an entire block away.  Chicken sliders are tasty- prefer the buffalo to the homestyle version. Their wings have several sauces and rival those at more popular wing chains, plus better fries. If the regular fries aren't enough of a health crime for you, they're also available topped with cheese, chili, bacon, and ranch, or any combination thereof. So far, I've successfully resisted.

I have had better food at a gas station! Service is terrible. It takes them forever to take an order and get the order out. The cashier spoke broken English, um you work at an American food place speak English!!!!!!!  Ok second, how does this place pass health inspections? The table have bird shit all over them and you have to bag them to get the employees to wipe the tables down. When they finally do, it's with a hardly damp cloth. No sanitized chemicals, nope just water! DISGUSTING!!!!!!  Third is the food. The loaded bacon fries were ok and so was the chicken bites kids meal, other than that we should have went to Wendy's. I would have taken McDonalds over this crap. I got a spicy chicken and not spicy at all and the meat was fatty. Processed chicken is very gross and I ended up throwing it away, goodby $7! My husband got a double bacon burger and he hated it.  My 10 year old said he would never eat here again but my 2 year old liked what he got. Another thing, don't bring your family here to eat outside unless you like seeing all the hookers walk around and try to pick up their next job. Where is VICE when you need them!

I decided to pig out a bit, so I ordered the Baconzilla, Chili Cheese Fries, and try the two apple pies for a buck.   First, it took too long. I was the 2nd car in line, the car ahead of me had to wait 10 minutes for their food which came inside of a tiny bag (I could swear I ordered more than that person). When I got to the window I had to wait almost 10 more minutes for my food   When I got back to my job to actually eat, my bag was missing my fork so I had to make do with a spoon that was available in the break room. I can get past a forgotten utensil, its all about the food right? The burger was cold and the bacon was hard. I only work 5 minutes from this place, it should not have been cold. The fries were also nothing to write home about - cold and salty. It's not really how I remembered Rally's fries - I was just there a couple of years ago and they didn't taste as salty. I didn't finish my food.  There was one redeeming factor: The Apple Pies. Deep fried and covered in cinnamon and sugar. Those were awesome - I finished those!

First off the burgers come with fake cheese that must be a sauce that comes in a can.  It tasted like a slimy, over salted, artificially flavored, thick oil. The meat was gray and flavorless - tasted more like tofu.  The bacon had to be fake.  It didn't taste like bacon - more like smoked cardboard.  The bread was super soggy and bland.  I took two bites and threw it away.  I tried a bite of the steak burger and it was even worse - tasted like salty old used grease from a diner.  It's been 5 hours and I still feel nauseated.

First of all, while they are  fast  food - you could design, build, and crawl through your own drive-through before getting to the window of theirs. Not that I was in much of a hurry, but I didn't feel like burning through a tank of gas for some fries and burger. By the time I got the order, I was just happy to be getting out of there, so I didn't bother to check what they gave me.  This must be their intent.  The SINGLE thing they got correct was the TYPE of burger. EVERYTHING else in the order was wrong, wrong, wrong. Sadly, I cannot even blame a language barrier for their incompetence - my server spoke perfect English.  I ordered unsweetened tea. First sip? BLECH!!! So sugary my heart started racing. While it was nearly a gallon's worth in their giant size (I ordered a medium), it all went down the drain because neither of us could stomach it.  I ordered a large fry (to share with my sweetie) - paid for it, too. Even checked the receipt to make sure I wasn't nuts. Size I actually got? Small. Kid's size perchance? There were maybe 6 fries total. They were yummy, but not what I ordered.  My burger didn't look anything like the picture, but that's to be expected. What I didn't expect was to order a cheese/bacon burger with pickles and onion and NO TOMATO only to get the exact opposite - NO pickle, NO onion, EXTRA tomato. Ick. I swapped with my sweetie for the one that was ordered as-is. Guess what was on it? Nothing. Nada. No condiments other than a splotch of what I think was BBQ sauce pooled on the tip of one side. At least they got the cheese right.  Again, the food wasn't too bad taste-wise - but if you want what you actually order, have them repeat it to you, repeat again, maybe go a third round, and then check your bag before you leave.", "Date": "2012-09-10", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Sharon", "ReviewID": "87-HOf4Ir1tCvGR_NySssA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I go for the food and the ambience.

No lie- a half hour and only 3 cars ahead of me when I pulled in. I would have left after the first 5 minutes with no movement, but once you're in and someone gets behind you, you're trapped.   Just when I got up to the window to get the food, the guy in a huge GMC Yukon in front of me ran out of gas and blocked the exit for 10 more minutes.  They usually have 2 drive thru lanes open but for some reason they had the left side closed. Brilliant.  It's Ok though because I was entertained while I waited by a ranting and raving homeless woman hanging out in the outside dining area who was alternately screaming at an imaginary person in a stream of expletives and sobbing.  Other than that I like the Big Buford burgers- that's their top level double cheese burger. They're large and tasty. Good fresh toppings. They stand up to any of the other fast food places signature burgers for taste and value.  They also have a good variety of menu items with frequent specials running.  The fries are pretty bad IMO. They are kind of like the curly fries at other places but straight cut. They have some spice cooked into them that I just don't like.  If I hadn't had the really bad drive thru experience I described above I would have given them 3 stars. Their service is hit and miss usually.

If you're going to go here I would not suggest the regular burger. It felt overpriced and too greasy for an ordinary cheeseburger especially in Vegas. For cheaper you can get a better version of this cheeseburger at In N Out and everything tastes less greasy and more fresh.   I'm not a fan of bacon burgers but the bacon burger my boyfriend got was way bigger and tastier than my burger and about the same price. The biggest strength of the entire bacon burger was the barbecue sauce. Definitely the right thickness and taste. Would highly recommend this if you come for a burger, as it beats Carl's Jr's western bacon burgers out of the water, as well as most other bbq bacon burgers I've recalled having.  Otherwise it was standard fair for fast food. On par with other fast food services.  The mozzarella sticks are fine too. They're on par with most mozzarella sticks from other places. The winner here is the fries. The fries are amazing.  I'm not sure if they were fried in animal fat but the oil they used definitely had some flavor to it.

The chocolate shake just tasted like melted vanilla soft serve, not really that much of a chocolate taste.  I thought the spicy chicken sandwich was alright and Dad thought the double burger was pretty unremarkable and surprisingly small.  The fries were alright...easily the best part of the meal, which isn't saying too much. Dad tried to get ketchup for the fries by ringing the bell at the front window for service, but no one would come to the window so he ended up eating them dry.

On my burger, specifically, I had 1 whole crispy onion that was the size of a .50 cent piece, and about 3 tiny broken pieces as well as possibly the worst BBQ sauce I've ever had.   Next up, the baconzilla fries. I was actually pissed. No where's in the description does it state that the douse the fries in ketchup along with cheese and bacon. Did I mention that I loath ketchup?
