We saw the advertising for the NY strip steak on the menu. So as a steak lover I thought let's give it a try. I believe we paid $13,99 each. Not bad at all, considering steak is an expensive thing plus all you can eat. Let me tell you the steak was delicious! I've tried a lot of stuff there, including the salad bar and pasta and desert. I went each single day of our stay there because I loved the food. It was fresh and tasty and for $13,99 I think it's an extremely good deal.

It was 5:00 and we figured at this hour everything would be fresh and hot.  Wrong assumption!  On every section (Chinese, Mongolian hotpot, Italian, BBQ) the food was lukewarm.  The hot & sour soup wasn't even that.  I won't itemize each item I sampled, but I found nothing to be palatable.  Their salad bar doesn't look fresh, has very few items, & appears like Las Vegas in the fifties.  The Chinese section is pitiful, with overcooked veggies, dried up noodles & a poor selection.  The Italian is not your grandma's kitchen... thick, over-cheesed pizza, a mushy lasagna, a very boring pesto over cold bowtie pasta.  The BBQ section was serving up steak, dark turkey meat & one more item.  I tried the turkey, but didn't have a second bite.  There is ONE kind of bread which had garlic on it, was cold & hard from sitting too long.  The Mongolian section I skipped because there were only  cheap  choices, like tiny cuts of carrots, bean sprouts, onions, green peppers, & the  meat  of chicken, shrimp & pork was in the back so you couldn't see it until they cooked everything.  Desserts?  My partner tried 3 of them & said they were tasteless & the cover-up was too much whipped cream.  I spoke to the manager about the total lack of hot food & she said she'd call the chef who finally emerged to tell me all the burners are on hot, there is no problem whatsoever; that she couldn't believe I found all that food to be lukewarm.  We left in frustration and chose to never return.  With all of the buffet competition in this town, how can Suncoast/Summerlin serve up such an inferior buffet?

I had a buy one get one free coupon but realized it doesn't start until August 1, but decided to give it a try for a locals $8.88 deal. I brought my mother and 15 year old niece with me. Cashier charges us $8.88 for me and my mom and my niece was charged $13.99 because there is no discount for anyone under 21. So $34 for 3 of us , not bad , or so I thought. My first impression when I walked up to the small buffet area was oh no this whole buffet looks awful. We tried pizza which was horrible and had a very funny taste that I can't even pinpoint . I also tried pesto pasta and took 2 bites and left that on the plate . Dried almost to the point of been rock hard. The taste was horrible and the oil was just seeping from the pasta. Plate 3, I figured I could have salad. The salad area was very small but was the only fresh food item in the whole buffet. I have romaine lettuce was crisp and I topped with small carrots and onion . The ranch dressing was thin and watery but edible.  These 3 items are the only ones I tried as everything else looked absolutely disgusting. My mom tried to eat a pork chop but could not because if was so hard you could t even cut it. My recommendation is to never eat here. Seriously the worst food I have ever saw or sampled . I would never eat here again even if it was free. We almost got up 5 minutes after we ate and left but have decided the salad would hold us over until we ate later.

You expect lines for a good buffet, but not for the really bad ones. It took 30 minutes to get to the cashier, not so much because there were a lot of people, no. It was due to the comical incompetence of the staff. Four registers and only one working with 7 employees manning the one! Despite there being cashiers and hosts and a manager no one seemed to have ever seen the coupons that all these places have for locals every week, or the comp slips that loyal gamblers get from the casino. Literally every single customer seemed like the end of the world as these people had no idea what to do with the coupons or how to process them.  Meanwhile, a host and a manager are getting into a yelling fight in front of everyone when they could have moved the shouting match 4 feet and out of sight of the rest of us.  Now the food: Skip it, just go eat somewhere else.  I did find the mongolian grill okay but the chef there was rude and testy with the other staff and the customers. The rest of the food was generally tasteless and gassy. We left feeling bloated and ripped off, and spent far too much time in the restroom the rest of the night!

They had a nice big tray of bacon but is was so dried out and stuck together, you couldn't really pick up a piece without it either falling about or being about 6 strips.

With the B-connected card, I paid $7.56 for lunch on a Monday (including tax and beverage). As soon as I sat down, I was promptly greeted and brought my drink of choice. I perused the choices and began to wonder if I should have listened to the advice of many other Yelpers who highly discouraged others from visiting the buffet. There seemed to be a few good choices, but some items looked pretty unappealing. I proceeded trying to keep an open mind, the buffet was $7 after all!   I began with the Mongolian BBQ station, excited because my regular Mongolian joint back home had recently closed. I chose my items and was a bit disappointed at their lack of noodles. The man working the station was very nice. While waiting for my plate, I tried to take a look behind the counter. Not fantastically clean, but not horrible, nothing crawling around at least! I saw nothing that made me run out. Once I started on my plate, I began to wonder more and more if I should have risked this place. The meat (beef and chicken) were quite bland (probably because teriyaki sauce was not poured onto the food until right before it touched the plate). Since the food wasn't completely awful, I continued with my plate. All complaints aside, the Mongolian BBQ guy did give me an impressive amount of meat. After several bites and sips of soda though, I began to feel a bit queasy. I attributed this to my reading of other reviews claiming food poisoning, probably all in my head. Being unsure about the food, I ate quite slowly. I found it a little weird how quickly the meat on my plate became luke warm/cold but figured that I had just eaten it too slowly. On to another plate!   Having grown up by the ocean in California, I tend to stay away from seafood in a place like Las Vegas. This seemed like an especially good choice based on other food at the buffet so far.  I grabbed a couple of things from the Chinese food area. The sweet and sour chicken looked pretty good. It had a hint of good flavor but for the most part was just too bland for me (and this is coming from a pretty picky eater who often enjoys bland foods...). The worst thing about the chicken was the temperature though, calling it luke warm would be a generous overstatement. The steamed white rice on the other hand, was fluffy and tasted as it should. It could have been warmer, but maybe that's asking too much here. I ate quite a bit of the plain white rice, all the while wondering if I would regret this meal later.   Although I had yet to visit the American, Mexican, Italian, or dessert stations, I opted to end my buffet experience in fear that I would spend the rest of my last day in Vegas sick in my room from the buffet food.   In the end, I did not get sick from eating at the buffet but felt pretty thankful of this. A friend of mine who are her at another point during our trip thinks she got a little sick from eating here, but she wasn't quite sure.   Even for the fantastic price, I would still suggest avoiding this buffet and eating at another fairly cheap option at Suncoast.  The Game  sports bar has great food and is very reasonably priced.", "Date": "2016-04-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Sheila", "ReviewID": "lGqJzj7wZ_1tJ55XPTA_sg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "For the record, I don't like buffets.  Also for the record, the decor and ambiance of St. Tropez has seen better days.  The paucity of diners on the night we went probably has a clue to why the Suncoast isn't spending any money to spiff up the joint.  So why did we go?  It's Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year and, like the other locals' casinos, they had their Jewish Pigout (pun intended) up and running.  That is, gefilte fish, chopped liver, whitefish salad, boiled chicken (I passed - yuk), brisket, potato knishes, potato latkes, matzo ball soup, tsimmes (a sweet potato and carrot concoction), noodle pudding.  Though I'm not a fan of this Eastern European peasant food (even though I grew up with it, including the boiled chicken), my husband is, and he wanted to go.  Who am I to deny him his thrice-per-year Old World extravaganza?  Truth is, the food was suprisingly excellent, despite the dreary surroundings.  So was most everything else I tried, though I didn't try a lot except more veggies.  The desserts were unremarkable, except they've jumped on the gelato bandwagon, so what more does one need?  For 12.99, including free wine and beer, you can't cook this kind of meal for the price.  The wine and beer thing is confusing, though.  We didn't realize until halfway through the meal that it was included, since the sign at the register proclaims that a glass of wine is $3.00.  I still don't understand it.  Dinner here turned out to be a nice surprise.  Next week we'll try the holiday one at Red Rock, and see how it compares.

Once for lunch, once for breakfast.  Lunch on Saturday - The signs all over the casino advertised an $8.99 buffet. So I walked up and figured I'd try it. First problem - It's only $8.99 if you're a member of the  Connect Players Club , the free in-house gambling loyalty program. If I wanted the $8.99 price I would have to wander off somewhere else in the Casino over to member services or something and sign up for the free loyalty program. I wasn't about to go figure that out (we were staying here on a rock climbing trip - not a gambling trip). So I paid full price, which was almost $15.  For the price, the buffet wasn't that great. Decent amount of choices for lunch type foods. But it was basically just the same as Old Country Buffet. This was not one of those fabled amazing cheap, amazing tasting Vegas buffets of mystery and legend.  On the other hand, everything was rotated in and out quickly so it was always fresh. Everything I tried (Pizza, Turkey, Mashed Potatoes, Veggies, Baked Chicken) was all pretty good. The soda and drinks are not self serve, but the waitress was very quick and friendly and kept us topped up. Overall for lunch I would have given three stars.  Now on Sunday, I'm subtracting a star. Again there were signs all over for a breakfast buffet. $8.99. This time I noticed the asterisk. I figured that was the loyalty card price. Three of us went downstairs anyway, expecting to pay a little more than that since we didn't have the cards, but not much more. I mean it was breakfast after all. So we get down there and are informed that because it's Sunday, there is no breakfast buffet. It's  Champions Brunch  and it's $24.99. Yikes. No way.

I waited for ten minutes for someone at the carving station, and he only came out after I reached for the knife and fork to serve myself.

Unless you pay more than $50 per person at one of the Strip buffets, you can expect standard buffet fare at any buffet in town.  For the price, the food at the Suncoast buffet, especially the breakfast and Sunday brunch buffet, is better than it needs to be. As a frequent diner at this and other buffets in town, Suncoast does a consistently better job than any of the other  locals  resort buffets.  I suspect some of the negative reviews come from folks who are expecting a four star restaurant dining experience. We have enjoyed dozens of buffet meals at the Suncoast and have always left feeling we got more than our money's worth. If we are in the mood for gourmet dining, we go a traditional restaurant and pay accordingly.

We got here at 7PM and a good amount of the food looked like it had seen better days.   Here is the good bad and the ugly...  The Good: Knowing well in advance to temper my expectations I went for the high ticket item of the buffet; Prime Rib. The first round the roast looked dismal and looked sun burnt from being under the heat lamp for the past 2 hours. After eating my first slice of prime jerky got up and waited for the carver to pull a new roast out of the heater. At that point pretended to be a shark circling the buffet waiting for him to break into the new roast. It was well worth the wait 3 thin slices of rare prime rib... That right there was worth my gas in my car to drive to Suncoast.    The salad bar believe it or not was stocked with GREEN lettuce and fresh veggies!  Pizza seemed to be a hot ticket item. Every trip up the the station there was a fresh pie waiting for me.    The Bad & Ugly:  The guacamole and wasabi both were brown and looked like it had developed a hard candy shell. Although I have a rock gut I decided not to tempt fate and eat my tacos w/o the green stuff.   The chili cheese fries looked and tasted like they tried to reincarnate last nights baked potatoes by cutting them into wedges and throwing chili on them.. Bleh!  The pasta and and ravioli looked sad and dismal. all the dishes looked like they were set out during the lunch buffet. Not even a dent in any one of them.    The food (some of it) is edible you just have to use your sound judgement and pick wisely.   In summary people, there is not much room to complain when we are all eating here for free or heavily discounted. So temper your expectations and be thankful for the free prime rib.

Armed with our American Casino Guide coupon, my family stopped here because we happened to be in the neighborhood.  Salad was not extensive, but what was there was fresh.  The marinated artichokes are a highlight.  Most of the hot foods appear to be of standard mid-level buffet quality:  Generally edible, but rarely exquisite.  One standout is the Spicy tofu: normally I don't like tofu, because it is so bland. However this added enough flavor to make it taste good.  Also, they have a gelato bar, which turns an otherwise uninspired dessert station into one worth stopping at.  I recommend the blood orange, coconut, chocolate, and pistachio flavors.  I'm not sure which marketing intern came up with the name  St. Tropez Buffet,  but the only thing similar that I could find to anything having to do with the French Riviera was the fact that the deli station offers cheese.  However, none of the cheeses appear to be French in any way.  I believe every restaurant should have at least some vague connection to its namesake.  (For example, the Orleans French Market buffet sometimes has crawdads.)  I've never been to St. Tropez, France, but I know enough about this buffet that it has no resemblance to St. Tropez in any conceivable way.

My 85 year old grandfather, who I only get to see once a year, is staying at the Sun Coast hotel, and that is the ONLY reason why we came to eat here.  The other reviews for this place are on point. Bad, inedible, cold, under/over cooked canned slop. Nothing looked appetizing or edible. My first plate consisted of pizza, and a few pieces of sausage and peppers. The pizza was ok, although I had to drown it in Ranch dressing to taste good. The sausage was warm, not hot, and under cooked, as well as the peppers that were almost raw. I tried the prime rib and that was at least edible, with lots of au jus and horseradish. Desserts were a hit or miss. They had ice cream, a small assortment of cakes and pies, and some sorry dried out bread pudding.

The other plus I've found here is that they serve Stuffed Cabbage!  Yep, I love me some old school, down-home cookin'.  Only buffet I know so far that serves it.

Weird.   The prime rib: So gross and odd textured that I didn't even try it this time.  The ham: mmmmmm..... ham! It was good.  The cornbread stuffing: you mean cornbread pudding?  Overall, this buffet was ok. Better than that damn Luxor experience, but not better than the Wynn's. Good selection of food, but because I'm afraid of all food prepared in large quantities, I don't try much.   The best part about the buffet was when some old guy reached for the tongs my boyfriend had in his hand in an attempt to get to the food first. Weird.   The worst part was the salad bar--which brings up a relevant question: Why are all the salad bars severely lacking at Vegas buffets???? I need more than lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, and croutons to create a salad.", "Date": "2010-10-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Kit", "ReviewID": "hVsIqeTF9ZQraGye9CprLg", "Overall": "1", "Content": "My sons and I wanted to go see a movie today and thought we would give this buffet a shot.

It wasn't particularly crowded when we went which was nice.  They have a decent selection but nothing special or that good.  The service was better than average but the food was just average.  The dessert selection was the best part of the food.

Ever.   I had only been in there on one occasion before yesterday and that was to see Paranormal Activity with some friends. That was almost 3 years ago, and even back then I could see that I definitely wasn't missing much.   Yesterday, I just so happened to be at Tivoli Village for the first time (I also see I wasn't missing a whole lot there either, but that's a different review), and since none of the restaurants in there appealed to me and the friend I was with, we decided to just drive across the street to the Suncoast. Turns out this was a bad idea.  The whole place just felt very......empty. There was no line for the buffet whatsoever, and when is someone NOT happy about that? That's the gift. What lies within the buffet is the curse.   Not having to wait in line was nice. The price wasn't bad either, $8.99 to be exact. The service: so-so. Our waitress always had a smile, but she wasn't the most attentive either. The ambiance was quiet. Way too quiet. The place also had this creepy, medieval dungeon like feel to it. *shivers* As for the food? Oh dear.  To begin, let me tell you something funny: the section that was labeled seafood had none whatsoever. It was used for cold cuts and bread. (Yes, you read that right. This is a buffet that has cold cuts.) The stromboli and taquitos were so dry. Quite possibly the blandest sweet potato fries I've ever had. The best part had to be the waffle fries and the spring rolls unfortunately. As for my friend, she claimed her food (which included some of those cold cuts from the  seafood  section) smelled funny and had to stop eating because the smell was making her sick.   Why 2 stars and not 1? Pumpkin Cheesecake in the dessert section, that's why. Ironically the only buffet I have ever been to which serves it.   The Final Verdict:  Pros:  Cheap. Pumpkin Cheesecake.  Cons: Generally gross. Slightly creepy interior.  Severely lacking in variety.   Suggestions: Just go to another buffet.  Return factor: Nada, not even for the pumpkin cheesecake.", "Date": "2012-04-01", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Super", "ReviewID": "pYjjvjv8GGnCdrCbJf7Jwg", "Overall": "1", "Content": "OMG, way way nasty all cold food (thats how you get friggin Tapeworms) and dysentera. surly help, not one employee greeted us with a smile at all.

What I wanted to say in my quick tip is this:  Hide the free buffet coupons from your husband.  Yes, that is my quick tip.  Of course, I should be fair and say that for my belly all buffets are pretty much one star, unless they're Indian. As a result of some free coupons that showed up in the mail, however, I have eaten lunch at St. Tropez twice now. By the end of the second trip, my husband and I were joking that we should establish a buffet rating system based on how many things you end up spitting out. Yes, that is juvenile, but we thought it was rather funny, especially after he spit out like the 4th thing.   Personally, I only spit out one thing: some foul tasting steamed broccoli. I am sorry, but it tasted like poop. I survived my trips to the buffet with the following: noodles from the  Asian  section, some cold salads, baked sweet potatoes and some bean tacos (hold the guacamole because it was brown on the first trip), and some pretty good Chinese broccoli. Even the salad bar was a little disappointing because there were no mixed greens. A fabulous salad bar could earn a star upgrade from me. The sweets section is enticing, but the rice crispy treats were stale. How anticlimactic. The bright spot is the staff as they are definitely cheerful and hardworking! It is cheap too I suppose.  Again, if you want a buffet lover's opinion, this is not it, but even with the free coupons, we don't have plans for a third visit.

First of all there was only one line to stand in, it happened to say emerald card line only, which I did not have one, but the other side was closed. So im standing in line and a woman behind me asks if I have a an emerald card I said no, then she is complaining to me that she has one, and she is confused why everyone is in one line. Hey it isn't my problem! then she starts telling a man that gets in line how some people don't have a emerald card but they are in this line! He says to her, that's what happens to nice people that follow the rules, so here I am being put down, and talked about thru no fault of mine lol whatever. On to the food, one word Awful! everthing had no flavor, you would think being at a buffet you could find something edible, nope. Food was bland, tasted old, or cold. The Chinese food was the worst to me. It is sad this buffet was one of the best in town, about 10 years ago, not sure why It has gone downhill so bad, I have given several chances the last few years. Next my daughter spilled her drink, so I told a served we had an accident and needed a towel, what do you they give me 3 napkins LOL! Didn't offer to clean the table with a wet towel and clear the ice, so for the remainder of this disaster we sat at a sticky wet ice filled table, This is just a joke, will not becoming back.", "Date": "2015-06-01", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Yen", "ReviewID": "9DG3BqtqWC511D_aBg-EXQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "My bf and I came here and I think this was the best buffet I have been to.
