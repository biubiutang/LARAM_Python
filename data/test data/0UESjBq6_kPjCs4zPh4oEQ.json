But, they are not good. The cheese is fake of from a can or something and it looks like they gave a single slice of cheap bacon. I'm drunk and it isn't even that good. Such a let down.", "Date": "2016-05-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Anna", "ReviewID": "H5-KR4LWB_VntuoExTzu8A", "Overall": "3", "Content": "3.5 stars. They suckered me in with a chicken tender sample and I was too tired to hunt for something else more  quality . I had the 3 tender basket with Mac n cheese and cucumber salad. The tenders were juicy, but kind of bland by themselves. Definitely needed the buffalo sauce. The Mac n cheese was pretty standard, but the cucumber salad was not good. It was very bland and the cucumbers had a very thick chewy skin. Overall not bad (and cheap for Vegas) but don't get the cucumber salad and be sure to get some sauce!", "Date": "2016-04-23", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "William", "ReviewID": "GOVDxWNzI05faw9JexQGVw", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Service was good.

Reminds me of Chick fil a. Bread was soft and fresh, and fries were fat and extra crispy.

Best chicken i had in my life when i was at the airport.  The last person i met worked there, She's cool and we still keep in contact. Thanks for the Friend and Awesome chicken strips.  Note- The Grandma sauce that I did not want accidentally spilled on my chicken when going to the airport. That was the best thing to happen to them.  Heading back to vegas again just for the strips.
