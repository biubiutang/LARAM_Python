For lunch, they have awesome lunch special deals. I got the Beef Lo Mein with the Egg Flower Soup, Curry Puff (aka Crab Rangoon), and Steamed Rice. All of which was hot and delicious when it made its way to the table. The portion was a good size for the buck, although I wish they added a little more rice on the side.

You get good service, good food and a good price.  Rose Garden in Down Town Henderson is no exception.  I first heard of it through Yelp a few day prior to my visit.  It sounded good but I was already home for the night and didn't want to go back out.  Instead, I waited until after a morning hike on Saturday.  I came it for lunch and was pleased to see the lunch menu on the table.  So many places do not offer their lunch specials on the weekends.  This place does.  Awesome!  And the lunch specials are a crazy good price.  I think some of them start at $3.25.  I got the lemon chicken lunch for $4.95.  For this incredible price I got lemon chicken, fried rice, a bowl of hot and sour soup and a curry puff.  Not a bad deal.  Not bad at all.  And it was good food too.    The chicken was the classic and better known to me style meaning it was a whole chicken breast breaded and fried then sliced and drizzled with lemon sauce.  The fried rice was about the same as you would find at other places but I can't say that I have ever had just a stellar fried rice that blows all others out of the water.  I've had some horrible fried rice in the past.  This was not one of those examples.  The curry puff seemed to be a cream cheese rangoon with some curry in the cheese mixture.  It was good but I would have liked a little more of that curry flavor.  I was given the choice between the curry puff and an egg roll.  I went with the curry puff because it sounded different.  I will be sure to try the egg roll next time.  I was also given a choice of soup.  It was between the hot an sour which I ordered and the tradition standard egg drop.  I went with the hot and sour because that is what I was craving when I first read about Rose Garden a few days prior to this visit.  It was more spicy than what I am used to at other Chinese places around town.  It may have even been more sour.  There was something that seemed off at first but I grew to like by the time I finished my bowl.  Not sure what though.  Probably just a flavoring I am not used to.  I could get used to it though.  I will be back.  Probably a lot I would imagine.  I think this just became my go to Chinese restaurant in the Henderson area.  I liked it that much.  I look forward to trying other items on the menu.  There is so much more on both the lunch and dinner menus.  The one thing I don't look forward to is the radio.  I think they are using an old radio with an antenna and it didn't seem to have the best reception. There was an awful lot of static.  When it comes to food, service and price, I'll learn to tune out the static.", "Date": "2016-01-11", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Candice", "ReviewID": "nL2xuneE2WoAJ-F0UUt2xg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I was in this location attending a seminar, didn't want fast food so of course found this place on Yelp.

It is in anything but a rose garden. It stands in a turn of the century business district that looks like the Old West. It is off Pacific Street between Water and Atlantic Streets a stone throw from Emerald Island. What is an amoly about this Henderson business is that you can park on a street without a meter then walk inside. On my visits, I'd park in the parking lot by the gun shop.       The Rose Garden is one of the two Chinese restaurants in the Water Street District. The other one is the Lotus. Being that I am on a mission to try different Chinese restaurants, it is no surprise that I dined here twice.     I'd take advantage of the lunch special. In my opinion, the Chinese restaurant lunch specials are the best deals around. As soon as I looked at the lunch special sign in the window, I saw prices starting at $3.95 with the pork lo mein lunch special. The starting price entrees were only a couple. The majority were a few cents short of the average lunch special price.     From my experience, Chinese restaurants come in two varieties: the take out and casual restaurant setting. This is a casual restaurant setting. Their is a waiter that brings the food to the table in regular plates with silverware. This is not a China Go Go setting where they serve the food in containers with plastic forks.      The first time I dined here I ordered the shrimp lo mein lunch special. The second time I ordered the pepper steak. It came with skinny crunchy noodles with duck sauce, hit and sour or egg drop soup, fried rice, and egg roll. Hot tea is an additional 50 cents and a glass of Coke is 99 cents. After a tip the food would come out to $8.00 which in reality is on par with the majority of lunch specials.     If this were a job performance evaluation, the food would be a solid performer but not a great performer. The service was likewise good. Then again it's not like I was sharing the place with many people either.      The thing I dislike is that the check does not separate the tax, beverage, and entree. When I tip I like to double the tax. Oh well!      It was nice dining at Rose Garden two times. The reality is that I prefer The Lotus and new China Inn very close to The Rose Garden. In my opinion, they are a star better with larger servings and not much more money. Additionally The Lotus offers wonton soup. Ultimately in my opinion Rose Garden is a solid Chinese restaurant but nothing great.", "Date": "2016-03-09", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "I9UJzYB8vjCbXoFk-haAcw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Great food, nice people.

I was hungry for Chinese food for lunch and having had some bad experiences I'm always on the lookout for new places to try.   Parking is on the street, and without a lot of people around I didn't have to park but 3 spaces from the door. Stepping inside you'll find a clean but yet a little bit dated restaurant that does offer plenty of space.   Service was prompt and attentive without being overbearing. My menu was on my table in under 60 seconds, I had my order taken in under 3. They have lunch specials and I ordered Kung Pao Chicken, Egg Flower Soup (aka Egg Drop Soup), and it came with an egg roll and a wonton.   While I waited on my food I looked around. The place had several older couples and a noisy group from Chicago in there that were almost finished and were leaving. On the table they had Kimlan soy sauce but they didn't have any sugar, just packets of Sweet N Low. I thought that was kind of odd as usually you get a choice. They also left the regular menu on the table and I took a look. The back cover says they don't use MSG. I took a picture of that as well as I hate MSG. My Egg Flower soup arrived and while hot, it was nothing special either. Lots of crunchy noodles were sacrificed in order to make it workable.   The food arrived fairly quickly and it was hot. Not pepper hot, I'm talking physical temperature wise. Kinda made me suspect microwave usage but I can't confirm that. I snapped a picture of the plate...fried rice on the side, Kung Pao chicken on the other so you can see what I had in front of me. One thing I look at with Kung Pao Chicken is the celery / filler to meat ratio. This plate ended up having a bit more celery than I like to see. Also it's not Kung Pao anything without peppers, and the plate was a little skimpy on the peppers. I counted the equivalent of 2 peppers. It should have been at least double that.   The egg roll was no better than the stuff you'll find at Vons in the frozen food section. But the deep fried wonton was not good. It had very little filling, and what was there just didn't taste good at all. I didn't spit it out but the thought crossed my mind.   As I finished up I put my debit card out on the table and not long afterward a man approached and said their credit card machine was down. I ended up paying with cash, but in this day and age there's really no reason to not have up to date and working payment systems in place, even for a small business.   Overall....if I find myself in downtown Henderson and hungry during the week I would consider coming here again. 3 stars: For a lunch special the price is perfect. And they only charged $.99 for a soft drink which is almost unheard of in the land of $2 and UP for the same thing elsewhere.    Note: They don't take checks (checks are evil anyway) and they do offer a limited selection of beer, wine, and sake is mentioned too on the card on the table. Also if you want to see if a place is kept clean, just look up. The air vents in this place were clean...which is a sign of attention to detail.", "Date": "2012-04-10", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Beth", "ReviewID": "1__qqaZSgveUeyiXeFQRAg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Thought we were going to San Pan.

Totally lacked flavor. When our lunches came out we dug in cause we were extra hungry. The look on Joel's face. His Orange Chicken tasted like someone mixed the Orange Sauce with Sweet and Sour Sauce. It was red, gloppy and had an off texture. Bad soooo bad! My Kung Pow Shrimp was ok. It seemed to mostly contain celery and a few shrimp. Not as spicy as I expected either. We both got fried rice. Ick!! Off colored and totally void of any flavor. I was thinking ok, the egg roll could be good, maybe. I was wrong!!! Talk about gross. I really think it was rotten because it had such an off taste. I quickly spit it out.
