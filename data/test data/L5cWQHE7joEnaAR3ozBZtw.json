Store is best used for its great pharmacy. Fast and helpful service. Usually get the flu shot here every year. Like the program that when you buy a shot, a person in need will get a shot. Seems like a great deal! Use to find gnome statues here, but not so anymore. Walgreens, bring back the gnome statues! Got to say that this store has a great selection of cards, candy, and beauty products. Really like that after holidays, stuff that is left over is 50% off. Great place to do last minute Christmas shopping if you are a procrastinator.

I guess the best way I could review it is, no one really takes any pride in working here, that's for sure. They are slow to help you, and when they do, they make sure to do it with the least work as possible. They really need to make sure their cash register guy takes showers before he comes to work. Not to be horribly mean, but the guy is filthy. You can smell him from behind the checkout, and has clear visual signs of non cleanliness. Not just once, every time I go there. He is nice though, just dirty. I bought beer there last week, and realized it expired in April, (3 months ago). Wasn't too happy about that, but I can't let myself waste beer so I drank it anyway...but wasn't happy about it.", "Date": "2014-07-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Maly", "ReviewID": "G4Pmfvjrp8MtNDgnLD_nPQ", "Overall": "3", "Content": "This Walgreens pharmacy is the longest wait ever!

I am beyond upset with the way the employees treated me. I went in to buy some Easter candy. There were no signs up at all. I asked the lady at the cashier to check the price for me. She did not seem like she knew what she was doing all at. ONE, she did not read description for the AD or the coupon. She just kept trying to scan the items and the coupon. She took 20 mins to check the price that didn't even come out right then she finally called the manager. The manager was also beyond rude. His reason for having NO SIGNS up for the sale,  We just opened.  Well, my question is,  Shouldn't you be prepared for your customers with questions and the correct price when you first open?  How is that even a valid excuse for your store not being prepared??? The manager also told me that an item I wanted to purchase wasn't apart of the sale when the description of the item clearly met the description of the ad. He told me that the items just weren't apart of the sale. Well, how do you know? You're not even prepared. Almost all the candy is expired also! I wonder what else is expired in this store. The manager told me that he doesn't even look at that all. So, you don't look at the expiration dates for the items in your stores? You don't ask your employees to check the expiration dates? I wasted 20 minutes at the store but I still didn't find the items listed on the ad. The manager told me he would help me find the ones that are apart of the sale but since he doesn't know what's apart of the sale how much longer would it take for him to find out?? Should I stay at the store for 1-2 hours to wait for him to find out?! I am even more upset that I asked the cashier for a coupon that was in the machine and SHE SAID NO IN A VERY RUDE MANNER then SHE RIPPED THE COUPON IN FRONT OF MY FACE AND THREW IT AWAY. I will find out the names of these employees if I EVER GO THERE AGAIN and I will complain to Walgreens for sure!!!!!!!!  The cashier who helped me is a Filipino lady and she is usually there in the morning. She is ALWAYS slow at ringing up items or helping customers.", "Date": "2016-03-20", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Alyssa", "ReviewID": "dRHFx-5GIbOBMhLwpRXnVQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "All the staff I have come across has always been friendly.

Maria the pharmacist in charge has no idea what she's talking about and the guys that get your prescriptions pretty much run the show.

She went above and beyond.   I dropped my prescriptions off for an operation I'm having in five days.   She was amazing and I went to have them filled and she noticed one of the prescription wasn't covered under my insurance and faxed the doctor and was just really great.  I proceeded to go home and call back later in the day to see if they reached the doctor per changing one of the prescriptions to cover my insurance. I was on hold over 50 minutes and hung up on more than three times.  And during the call where I was on hold for FIFTY minutes plus I never once was told do you mind holding they just would pick up and hang up and place back on hold every time it took me off hold because I was on hold too long and rung back to alert they have a client on hold so long ring ring remember u have someone on the phone .... Absolutely heinous customer service.  Try this when the phone rings don't just pick up and click to hold try saying do you mind holding or I'm sorry one more moment or we're getting to you there's 11 guests in front of you.

They have a pharmacy, which I don't use so I can't review. There is a redbox outside, so that's cool. If you are a crazy coupon person, you can save a ton of money buying here with their in-ad specials...   Keep your eyes peeled for their red shelf labels, those items are discontinued and usually you can get some good deals. Typically I come here when we are in a rush to get something - birthday card, case of beer, ibuprofen, allergy medicine - and it's convenient because it's on my way home from work.

This was a big guy with a red shirt that was working around 5 pm today (big built, not big fat :P). I was wandering around the store looking for a few items and quite sure I looked confused, so instead of ignoring me, he came up and helped me find what I was looking for. I had another issue at the register as it relates to my points card and when the cashier wasn't sure how to correct it, he came right up and resolved the situation in a jiffy! Super nice guy who provided excellent service!  Bumping it up a star based on that guy alone! Plus the crew at the pharmacy is usually really good too! Just don't wait in the drive thru if there is more than 1 car because it can take forever!  4 stars.", "Date": "2016-05-24", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Gary", "ReviewID": "4CtOI18RlveTwFq84-6TdQ", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Went to pick up a prescription to only be told that my medicine wasn't in stock.

I've been coming here for almost 2 years now and I have to say that the guest service has gone down the drain.    For example I went to pick up a prescription because I was sick and I told them that I would wait for it.  So after 40 minutes I finally go back to the window and no apology....the guy just tells me.   The pharmacist called u.  Really? When?  I was sitting in the chairs the whole time waiting for my name to be called.  But seriously? no apology? And way to go....blame the customer.  Geez thanks.  So not only do I have the flu but apparently I'm deaf too.  So what did she do?  whisper my name or call when a lady was crying because she was getting her flu shot? And didn't bother repeating herself?  Really? Wasted 40 minutes wishing I was home and in bed just because they couldn't waste their time calling my name.  Just because they couldn't take the extra few minutes to make sure that I got my meds on time.  Thanks a lot pharmacy staff...yeah for wasting time that I did NOT have today.", "Date": "2015-01-13", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
