The Strawberry Daiquiri and Pi√±a Colada were the perfect amount of sweet and made just right to give you a nice buzz. The bartenders were really friendly and fun- plus it's even nicer cause you can take the drinks into the pool.", "Date": "2016-07-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Seth", "ReviewID": "WL8YUYadsPU4OU-vQh0B-g", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Poolside service always comes at a price, but $54 for two 30oz mixers drinks?

So tasty and refreshing, it is not super sweet and so different.  I tried it with Ketel one and had my socks knocked off.  The bartenders are super nice and attentive.  The chips and guac also hit the spot.  Can't wait to return to paradise, love the Mirage pool area!", "Date": "2016-09-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Chanelle", "ReviewID": "W4m0LF8FsX0kUBcLTws1WQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Awe, now this bar is what vacay is all about.   A circular bar next to the pool with a tiki look and feel. This is the perfect bar when looking for refuge from the sun and heat. They have misters all around and blissful drinks. The bartenders are pretty cool. Not too many people here so there is plenty of elbow room. Although, there is not much seating here and not good for hanging in groups. They have flat screens too if you are trying to catch a game. But really it's all about grabbing a big drink and taking back over to the pool.", "Date": "2012-06-07", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "ALFREDO", "ReviewID": "COFjbM33NHuqZDRhRAwsfA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "This has to be one of my favorite bars on earth. You are in paradise, with the best tropical pool and relaxing atmosphere in Vegas. My go to drinks here are always the mai tais,  and the Cadillac margarita, yes they are pricey but made to perfection, stiff, and delicious. Great atmosphere. I see a lot of people also drinking pina coladas.  I love the Dolphin bar...", "Date": "2016-09-10", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "SD", "ReviewID": "ACP3xS7tafpa_RTuELIJkg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Friendly bartender while we were here over 4th of July weekend.  The drinks were top notch! Pina coladas and frozen margaritas, in particular - amazing! Just like being in Maui or Mexico.  The drink prices are extremely expensive, but that is par for the course on the Vegas strip.  We didn't hang out here (we just carried the drinks back to our pool chairs), but it would be a fun place to hang out, as there are TVs, comfy seating, and the whole bar has a cute, circular, Caribbean hut-like atmosphere.", "Date": "2016-07-12", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
