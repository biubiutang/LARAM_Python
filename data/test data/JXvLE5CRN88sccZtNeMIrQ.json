A little nicer and cleaner than other Roberto's but the food is the same no matter which Roberto's you stop in at.   Best meal at 3am when you're belligerently drunk trying to find your way home. They always mess up my order. But whatever they give me, I finish it all. I heart the steak nacho's with extra salsa and sour cream. The best deal is the crunchy chicken taco with a chicken enchilada combo. I love how they stuff the taco with loads of shredded chicken, a little lettuce and tons of cheese.  The enchilada compliments it quite nicely.  The guacamole is processed but what the  o lay  do you expect for great mexican food at these cheap prices? Skip the beans, they aint  that great either. Tacos, enchilada's, nacho's, burrtio's, you can't go wrong ordering any of these.  Don't even think about going to Taco hell.

It's the only drive through Roberto's I've ever seen, and I can see why it didn't take off. The amount of time it takes for you to get your food is the same as inside a regular Roberto's, so I imagine if there's ever more than one car in line, people get really antsy and annoyed, where really, it's just like ordering inside, same wait. Plus you can roll up in your pajamas.   Food taste and quality is consistent with other Roberto's, to me this had more entertainment value than anything- rolling up to a suspect speaker to order, waiting in car and watching people stumble across adjacent empty dirt lot into the night like walking dead, some shady dealing going on in poorly lit lot behind- just adds to atmosphere.   Probably will avoid though, sort of feel safer waiting inside regular Roberto's, lol.", "Date": "2016-04-07", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Annabelle", "ReviewID": "6sRKlJUZ0q4UxQ7sRrcmoA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "This has to be the cleanest location.

There is a Roberto's in Arizona, but it is literally 50 miles away from my home.  I miss Roberto's.

This location wasn't as good as the one downtown but it was more of preference. My fish burrito was decent but the fish was a bit burned and had enough lettuce for a side salad.

Nope, they come drenched in the toppings and was soggy before I made it back home. 3 stars because the food is pretty good but you should probably go earlier in the day and not take advantage of the 24 hours.", "Date": "2016-08-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Rachel", "ReviewID": "pplZL1ek-08HysG9l3GXXA", "Overall": "2", "Content": "This Roberto's is located on Rancho between Lake Mead and Owens, across from the Fiesta Rancho, inside the Sinclair gas station.    Went today 8-12-15 at 11:15 AM for some takeout.     I've eaten many different menu items at many different Roberto's and they have all been a let-down.  I hate the mexican food in Las Vegas for the most part.  Where I grew up it is just completely different and better, IMHO.     My co-workers drag me here every Wednesday because every Wednesday Roberto's has 99 cent chicken tacos.  They were pretty awful today.  All of them were greasy, bland, and the tortillas were like chewing on shoe leather.  Even dousing them in tomatillo salsa didn't help.  The lettuce was full of inedible stalk pieces.  Even the guy who cuts the lettuce there don't give a f**k.    My co-workers will continue to make me go here every Wednesday so I'll have to find something edible here soon.

I recently came here while strapped for cash and being hungry after work.  I got the carne asada burrito for $6 and some change. It had guacamole and pico de gallo in it. As usual per this location, the meat  was seasoned well, and was still pretty tender. I guess I got lucky with a recently cooked batch of meat. The guacamole and pico tasted fresh and had good flavor to it as well. All three ingredients combined made for a good tasting and filling burrito.  Once again, I was given red and green sauce when I only ever ask for green. Whatever, not the end of the world. But pickled onions, carrots,  and jalapenos were put in my bag without having to ask, which was cool.

Both times I ordered a carna asada burrito with no pico. I ordered through the phone for pick up and the lady on the phone confirmed both times the no pico part of the order. Both times, I pick up during my lunch break, come back to work, open it up and theres pico. I called withint 6-7 mins from pick up. Spoke to a lady who stated she must have given me the wrong burrito. I informed her I was unable to get this since it has pico in it. She said that she will put my name in the book for a free burrito and she asked when would I be coming in. I told her I will come call back on my 15 min break and come by and pick it up. I call back an hour and a half later, spoke to another lady who stated that the lady already left and my name is not in the book. She also stated nobody called the store an hour and a half. So now I'm being called a liar. I asked for a manager. she said its just her and the cook and I can talk to the cook if I want. hrmm really? I asked if she could call the other employee regarding this, she states she doesn't have her number. I asked about the GM, she doesn't have his number either. I asked when will the GM, Jose, be in? She said IDK. I told her she can look at the schedule and tell me. Took her about 5 mins to look and come back and say tomorrow night. Wow thanks! So not only did I pay for a burrito I could not eat, but I also I have no time left to go get other food, so now I will be hungry until I get off work.Thanks Robertos!", "Date": "2016-02-01", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Klair", "ReviewID": "GwexhdFhjbru29uGvYAVgw", "Overall": "2", "Content": "2 stars only because It was good.

When I say grunting, it was loud because I was in the drive thru and she was in the back somewhere and the lady helping me was more interested in her drama than helping me!  So I finally get my carne asada breakfast burrito and it was bland! It was so under seasoned that the water down red chili couldn't help it! Why because the chili was bland and had zero heat or flavor as well!   So disappointing, that robertos is turning into a fast food chain! What they are today and what they were before are two polar opposite restaurants! You can tell that they have new leadership, just by looking at their cheesy marketing posters and flyers taped all over the place. Roberto's stop trying to be like the other fast food places because they suck and stay true to your brand and produce quality and not fast food!", "Date": "2015-09-23", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
