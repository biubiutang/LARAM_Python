It's located in a business park on Gibson Road and totally unassuming. Actually, if you didn't map it or look for the building number, you would never know it was there! It's unmarked and behind Green Valley Pools - look for the wooden barrel outside the door! You can park on Mary Crest or in the lot by their building.  I called about two months ago to inquire about their monthly tours and I was able to reserve a spot for me and my fiancé that way. When you get to the brewery, they collect $5 from each person, you sign in, and you get a very cool souvenir JJBC glass!  We got a quick history lesson and were given the opportunity to ask questions while browsing the space. Then, we jumped right into the best part, beer tasting.   We were offered their nine current beers. Fox Tail Gluten-Free Pale Ale (similar to a cider, light, but not sweet with a hint of hops; decent for a GF beer!), American Lager, Weize Guy Hefenweizen, Citra Rye Pale Ale, Hop Box Imperial IPA, J.J. Pro AM Foreign Extra Stout (Limited), Red Fox Russian Imperial Stout Dark Ale, Baby J's German Chocolate Cake Milk Stout (Limited), and 5th Anniversary Barrel Aged Smoked Wee Heavy Scotch Ale (Limited). Alcohol content ranged from 5-14%.  Everyone was really awesome and they were very generous with the tasting portions, inviting us to whatever was left over if we pleased. It was obvious that they were all very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about their jobs and the brewery. It created a wonderful atmosphere for a beer tour/tasting.   I'm not much of a beer drinker, so I can't really say how good it was or if it was better or worse than other beers in the same categories. My gauge is what my beer enthusiastic fiancé says. He really enjoyed all of them and states that the respective beers stood up to his favorite beers. His favorites from today were Hop Box and Red Fox. We both enjoyed Baby J's and will be searching for bottles soon since it's on a limited run.  The best part was not having to leave the valley for great craft beers and a brewery experience. I highly recommend the tour to all beer enthusiasts!", "Date": "2013-10-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Scott", "ReviewID": "kp8YOQp_mSjNEOAXqQGerA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Not at the brewery itself. Actually I'm in Denver, Colorado currently in the Tivoli brewery/pub.   I tried the Hot Box imported into the state on Tap and my god it's delicious. This imperial IPA is bittersweet and will not disappoint. It's very light for being over 9% ABV and the balance of the citrus compliments the crisp hop flavor that is not over bearing at all (80-90 IBUs).   To Joseph James; Colorado, the State of Beer, approves this drink! Can't wait to visit next time I'm near Sin City!", "Date": "2016-04-05", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Patti", "ReviewID": "BWuNh_5j7r1ZmH2IA1-mpg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I love Joe's Cola.

JJBC is a small brewery here in Southern Nevada.  They distribute to about a dozen different states right now.  As a local, I am proud of what they have done for Las Vegas and craft beer.    The free tour happens every third Saturday of the month.  Ours was started by Matthew Lisowski, the owner of the brewery.  Matt gave us an introduction and a short history of the brewery, including where the name came from (you will have to go on the tour to hear the story!).  Then Alex, the head brewer, took over the tour while Matt constantly poured us samples of the various beers that Joseph James makes.  It was really neat to drink really  green  beer straight out of the fermenter.  One such beer was a Steam lager that was a recipe by a local homebrewer, and was probably my favorite beer of the tour.  We also had a couple of other special release beers like the Hubub, a super hoppy, unbalanced beer that was brewed just once.  The 6 pack was free!    Matt definitely goes out of his way to make everyone feel at home in his small brewery.  We got to see the mash tun, the boil kettle, the grain mill, and various huge fermenters fermenting away.  As a homebrewer, it is always fascinating to see how the pros do this stuff.  Joseph James is a very intimate brewery, with a small staff, but they have some good beer, like the Red Fox Imperial Stout.    If you want to do the tour, just give them a call ahead of time and reserve a spot for you and your friends/family.  As others have mentioned, they also make soda, although you do have to be 21 to go on the tour.", "Date": "2011-07-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Nicole", "ReviewID": "aU5BSOQKyfcxLMOjZV-Z9Q", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Disclaimer: After a 21st birthday gone terribly wrong I am no longer a beer-drinker.  I've been trying to change that and figured a brewery tour would be a good place to learn a little more about the process and would hopefully help me appreciate what goes into making a craft beer.  Perhaps an appreciation would lead me to enjoy drinking beer?  I just so happened to come here on St. Patrick's Day to do the brewery tour.  There really isn't a more appropriate time for beer, now is there?  They welcomed us to their brewery with a green lager and all the employees were in the dressed in the spirit of things.  It was a fun way to start my Saturday afternoon.  It really wasn't much to the tour, so don't get your hopes up if you want to learn a lot about the brewing process.  Most of the time we all stood around and listened to what went into the particular beer we were drinking and they talked a little about hops and other ingredients.  They even passed around samples of several of the ingredients so we could see and smell what they looked like before they were converted over to beer.  We did get to see some of the machines and they briefly gave us the run-down of the purpose of each.  In all, we sampled about seven types of beer, including a gluten-free and another spiked with bourbon.  They were VERY generous with their pours and we even got to take home the sample glass they gave us!  While I am still acquiring my beer taste buds, I am happy to say that I really enjoyed the Weize Guy and (green) American Lager.  I'm sure it was because they are lighter beers, but I'll take what I can get.  The tour is definitely a fun way to spend an hour or two on your Saturday afternoon and I recommend it if you are interested in learning more about the beer-making process or just a fan of beer in general.  Very friendly employees definitely made our time enjoyable.  Held on the third Saturday of each month, have to RSVP to save a spot.  $5 per person.  Tip: This place is impossible to find.  It is not directly on Gibson but behind the stores facing the street.  Pull in behind the Dunkin' Donuts and look for the row of buildings.  The brewery is then on the backside of those buildings you are looking at.  There is no advertising on the front of their building at all, so you have to go by street number alone or hopefully you can spot their truck that is parked in front.", "Date": "2012-04-13", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Anthony", "ReviewID": "bUpsoYOniftG4qCQUN7-yQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Went to this very cool brewery on a beer tour with Las Vegas Beer Tours. Damn nice brewery and some damn tasty Beer!!!  I am a hop head, so Hop Box IPA was a real treat, very well made, quite hoppy IPA with a very impressive nose and flavor profile. Yummy!!!  But the special treat was the Hop Box IPA on Habenero Peppers. OMFG this was one awesome beer. The heat of the peppers danced among the hops like lovers in chick flick, it was outstanding.

For the low cost of 5$ a person you get a tasting glass, brewery education and a lot of beer. We went on St. Patricks Day, so they dyed their American Lager green for the occasion. The staff was dressed festively as well. We also got to sample their Fox Tail Gluten Free beer, Weize Guy, Tahoe Blue, Hop Box, Red Fox, Joe's Root Beer, and the special reserve Russian Imperial Stout (yum). I was impressed how good they were. They had a raffle at the end of the tour and gave away a butt load of beer, including whole kegs of beer! I was lucky enough to win a couple bottles of beer myself. Another plus to your imbibing, is that a % of their profits go towards Autism research. I would definitely go back, I'm looking forward to trying more of their seasonal and special reserve beers.", "Date": "2012-03-25", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Paolo", "ReviewID": "mIUHJ-jq3OBrk3r0gOMHVQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "It's hard not to be a fan of JJBC. They're a small company. They're local. They make great craft beer. They let you drink as much of it as you want. Responsibly.  Yes, the tour itself isn't much. Everything they have fits into a small space that's probably the size of a mechanic's garage. But JJBC more than makes up for that with the beer tastings. Their passion for great craft beer shows in the way they describe their product and in the way they share it with you.  I particularly enjoyed their Tahoe Blue Nevada Pale Ale, their JJ Pro Am California style steem beer (purposefully misspelled to avoid legal issues), and of course their Hop Box Imperial IPA. They also let you try  green  beer. No, not the colored stuff they serve up on St Paddy's Day. I'm talking about beer that isn't quite ready for the public, but they are willing to let some flow directly from the tanks.  If you aren't into beer, fret not. JJBC also makes some tasty root beer and cola. Their root beer is actually very good.  Buy local. Drink local. That's their unofficial slogan. I wholeheartedly agree!", "Date": "2011-08-27", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Kali", "ReviewID": "e2k85mX-Mqgv3SoZB4tD8g", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Very friendly staff, awesome beer, probably my favorite Vegas beer company.", "Date": "2015-07-01", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "David", "ReviewID": "A3jUtrdByr2DIRsDZDyCzg", "Overall": "3", "Content": "This review is for 3.5 stars.  As far as a brewery goes, Joseph James is one of the better spots in Las Vegas.  Many of the microbreweries in Las Vegas have specialties, and I would have to say Joseph James brews one great Stout.  Their IPA is solid but go for their stout if you find it.  Joseph James bottles and sells locally, but this brewery is just that, a brewery.  They don't have a real tasting bar like the other breweries in town.  Their beers are solid for the area, but it would be nice if they had a place to sample the rotating taps on site.", "Date": "2016-02-01", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Mi", "ReviewID": "R4-krXWeaJKIb8JiJIwbfQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Brewery tour rad  Staff are awesome  Russian bourbon aged stout is one of my top 4 favorites on earth", "Date": "2014-06-26", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "G4z17Wx5D6cEmhu6Spyqdw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "It might seem odd that you're getting a review of a brewery from a teetotaler whose entire experience with beer comes from a few sips of Emu Export Lager back in childhood and into my teenage years -- followed by a vow to stick to cola thank you very much. I never did  develop a taste  for beer.  Soft drinks and cola are still a great love and for that reason I am grateful to Joseph James for producing what could possibly be the finest cola I have ever tasted -  Joe's Cola . I first picked it up at Whole Foods but recently it's become available at Glazier's too and I hope the popularity just keeps growing because I can't get enough. The cola uses cane sugar instead of the high fructose corn syrup that makes soft drinks just taste weird to someone like me who grew up with cane sugar. Joe's is pleasantly mellow and not overly carbonated, while retaining a rich cola flavour with a back-taste that's almost like a hint of honey.  Thankyou Joseph James Brewing Company. You'll never sell me a drop of beer, but your cola is five stars all the way.", "Date": "2011-03-22", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Suzanne", "ReviewID": "-SJzb5gpFbvj6rGoFIBhqw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "For Henderson/Las Vegas it is 5 stars, but I've had better beer so I'm giving it 4 stars.

In that matter, no tasting room and you can't just visit it out of the blue.  They have a tour once a month. It's pretty much walk in and stand in one spot because its a very small spot.  The beers aren't anything special and that might be because they constantly change their recipes. Their one-offs tend to be their best bets but consistency in making them again is apparently tough for the brewery. (Hence  one-off )  Better bet going to Tenaya Creek or Big Dogs where you can see the Brewery as well as drink there.

We went for the tour of the brewery and it was interesting to see how this was ran. It isn't much of a tour rather than a gathering of people and beer. Not much goes on during the tour just basic details on how beer is brewed, bottled and such. It would definitely help to have the beer for tasting all out so people could decide what they like to try instead of having to wait to get through other beers.   The best beer that I had the pleasure of indulging with was the Bourbon Barrel Aged Imperial Stout and it was like Angels' trumpets were playing a mystical song that allowed for the flavors to unleash their potential in the flavor kingdom. To say the least, it's probably their best beer.   I was not expecting to get a pint glass as the glass that we get to keep, so that was definitely awesome, expected a taster glass.

Go online and see when the next JJBC tour is.  For $7 bucks you can't go wrong.  My beer tour started off with registering on the website.  Simple to use and the communication was excellent from the confirmation to a friendly reminder of the tour.  Parking depending on the size of your tour may or may not be a problem.  Be flexible and be happy.  While waiting to check-in everyone seemed excited including myself.  Everyone was all smiles and super friendly.  Checking in was a breeze.  Only 21 and over are allowed.  You get a very nice JJBC pint glass to sample with and away you go.  I don't want to give away to much of the tour.
