I have been to  many Japanese teppanyaki style grills over the years and this one is defiantly in my top 5.  The servers were very helpful and attentive and kept up with the flow even though they were slammed.  The chef showed up about 30 minutes after we were seated. From the time we were seated and fed we were there for about an hour and half. The food was great, but there are a lot of fillers (fried rice) since the meat portions are small and you may not get as much meat as someone else since the chef cuts all the meat portions at once and attempts to portion it out evenly, however, due to the amount of food you leave very full!  As in true teppanyaki style the chefs are very entertaining and great with children!  Overall I will definitely be back to the Geisha House!", "Date": "2012-02-16", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Corey", "ReviewID": "_EGYK19ZYI3GOrnsONmTRQ", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Called a week out to make a reservation for 10 people on a Saturday night. Hostess told me she wasn't allowed to make reservations for groups of 10 or more without Manager confirmation. She took my info and said her manager would call me back. Two days later, after hearing nothing, I call back to double check my reservation. Guy on the phone says,  I've never heard of that policy, consider yourself confirmed.   Day of reservation arrived, 7 of my 10 people have arrived. At 7:03 the hostess comes over and says that if my whole party isn't here by 7:15, they're going to cancel our reservation and put us on the waiting list. Rest of party arrives, we get seated, order drinks, and wait 30-40 minutes to receive drinks from the bar! Food was consistent with strip mall Asian food. Nothing to rave about. Very upset with this experience, as I've been there for sushi before and had excellent visits! If you can't get me a drink in less than 30 minutes, don't threaten my reservation because someone is running behind a couple minutes. Also watched the manager slamming things around in anger behind the hostess stand, keep that crap behind closed doors!", "Date": "2015-08-16", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Linda", "ReviewID": "NRHvwk6OE8bMk5fzFO8XZg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Had children at our table so did not get the full, fun show but the food was still excellent!", "Date": "2014-06-29", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "trixy", "ReviewID": "mZRyQwuazE90P6IkLbFGZQ", "Overall": "2", "Content": "If you want sushi only and have a large party, go elsewhere.

The food was cooked with too much lemon on the seafood, it overpowered the taste of it. The rice was cooked with garlic butter that was red. it made the rice look really weird, not tempting at all. He said it was to make it taste good and look pretty. There's Nothing pretty about red, bloody looking rice! I knew then It wasmn't going to taste good. I think they may put food coloring in the butter cause it kinda tasted funny with an after tatse. I don't know what ppl are eating or if they've ever had Really Good food. I have been around the globe and have had GOOOOOD food, so my taste buds are serious when it comes to good food.

Whether you choose to do sushi or the grill, this place is excellent! The staff is awesome too! Sad to say, but they know me by name and greet me each time I visit! :) The rolls are well made and each chef does an equally good job of preparing what you order.  The managers are always present and go out of their way to ensure you are enjoying your dining experience.  Negatives: they can be somewhat pricey. They used to have a happy hour that offered by two get one free rolls (great for pairs), but it seems to phase in and out of availability.  They also have late night naked sushi/party (I think they alternate weeks with the Fort Apache location), but when we tried to go it was kinda dead in there...but I've heard that it is usually a hot spot! *shrug*   Overall, I have repeatedly found the food to be well-prepared, fresh/good quality and the staff is friendly enough to make me feel comfortable and welcome.

We went to the location on desert inn, which is the original geisha. Our experience there was so wonderful, the food was full of flavor, portions were perfect, service was fun and efficient, and the price was right on for all the greatness you were receiving. So, when they opened a new location on our side of town, the northwest we were salivating with anticipation. We were visiting frequently, so much in fact that we knew the cooks by name and they knew our family. Now, here's my problem with the geisha house of NOW. We normally order the geisha special for my husband and I, which consists of a drink, soup, salad, a side (egg rolls, tempura) veggies, rice, chicken, filet mignon, and half lobster tail for 35.95. Not a bad deal, that's a lot of food! If your going to share, it's an additional ten dollars, no big deal. But here's my problem.....the portions have shrunk significantly! If your lucky you might get two small pieces of cut up lobster tail, five pieces of filet mignon and a few pieces of chicken, the majority of your plate is rice and veggies. So for 45.95 your paying for sides mostly. This is not how I remember geisha being all those years before. You would literally leave feeling full, and have some left overs for lunch the next day. Kids portions are no different, and your paying upwards of 15.00 to 17.00 depending on the type of meat they choose, this does not include a drink, so your adding an additional 2.50 for a soft drink. By the end of the night your looking at about 100-115 dollar bill without tip. Now, I love food..... I love good food and I will pay for a great meal without complaint, but I have been utterly disappointed with how much it seems they are cutting corners and shorting the customers portions for the price. I gave it 3 stars because its clean, and the service is friendly. Depending on who's cooking for you, the food can be great, and they put on a good show. As far as service goes I've only had one awful experience there and it was for lunch, so I dinged them for that as well.", "Date": "2013-01-24", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ashley", "ReviewID": "l7rJkeEuQiAaP7np1d0mgQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "We eat here alllllll the time.

I thought I would try this place - it was close.   The place is nice inside - service was efficient - not friendly though.     I order a beer and a spicy tuna handroll to start.  I am used to a cone shaped hand roll, but this was tube shaped and the size of an almond joy???  It was okay not great.  Then I ordered a cut roll.  I was watching him make it and something wasn't right, but i couldn't put my thumb on it.  It was okay - but I wasn't even close to being full or even satisified.  I order another roll off the menu.  Still - wan't quite sure what the prob was.  Again - it was okay.  After a hand roll and 2 cut rolls I was still starving - but geez I am on a budget.  Anyway - I realized they use small pieces of nori and therefor you end up with a smaller sushi roll.  The rolls were substantially smaller  than a typical roll!!!  I am not a glutton by any means but I expect a sushi roll to be a ...--- sushi roll!   I wasn't ordering off the kids menu here.    The bill was $40; 1 hand roll, 2 tiny rolls, 1 beer.  Usually 2 rolls will do the trick for me.  After 3 mini rolls I left unsatisfied and feeling duped.  In this economy people are looking for value - not skimpy mini rolls!

The concept sounded pretty interesting, like something out of a Yakuza movie or something...in any case, it didn't prove to be as neat as it sounded.  First off, this restaurant really is on the EDGE of town. We knew that going in to it, so that's not really a complaint, just an observation. Be prepared to drive pretty far if you live anywhere in the Valley other than the Northwest.  We got to the Geisha House and it was pretty busy. There was a small line to get in, maybe five minutes of waiting at the most, and then we were faced with the host. He took out Groupons and told us it would be $5 required gratuity. We said that would be fine, and then he said we had to pay it right then before entering. We begrudgingly paid the man, were each given a drink ticket and a hostess seated us outside on the covered patio.  I was surprised to find that there was no waitress that came and took our drink order. Instead, we had to go inside to the bar, which had a massive line, in order to get our drinks. They didn't even bring glasses of water to the table, so drink tickets had to be used for ANY drink, not just alcoholic ones. I ended up using mine on a bottle of water, and I had to purchase another for $2 after I drank it. Sort of cheesy, if you ask me.  Onto the Naked Sushi bit! In my head, I had imagined that we would have had our own table with a gorgeous naked woman on it with delicious sushi lined up for the taking....this was not so. It was more of a glorified buffet line, where everybody filed around a large circular cooking station in the corner of the restaurant. There were hot items, and in the middle of the line-up were two women with some truly nasty looking sushi laying on their bodies (leaves laid on the skin prevented the sushi from touching their bodies). I tried a bit of each piece and it was terrible! Not to mention that the girls were not exactly attractive and they looked like they wanted to kill someone while they were laying there. The hostess was actually far more attractive than the Naked Sushi girls, which isn't what I would have expected.  The saving grace, or the only grace, of this place were the chicken wings and fried rice. They were pretty tasty and we all loaded up our plates in abundance with those two items.   This sounded like it would be a good experience online, but proved to be rather disappointing when it came down to it.", "Date": "2012-02-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "yaime", "ReviewID": "cO0IrFBWj-xRu_UmNoVVQg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Love taking the family here for a special occasion, food is yummy and cooks are easy to talk to and lots of fun!", "Date": "2014-08-29", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
