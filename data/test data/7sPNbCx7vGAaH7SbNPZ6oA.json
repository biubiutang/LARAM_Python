It's always bad service whenever we come. We were entertaining some people from out of town. We were seated after 20 something minutes (they said 15 minutes). We saw our waitress like... 2x the entire 2 hours that we were there. Told them we had a baby with us and they didnt give us a highchair (hubby had to get it himself). The guys ordered a beer and hubby requested some beer glasses, which never came so the hubby had to get them himself. Our oxtail chilli cheese fries came and we had no utensils or napkins. We requested them but didn't get them til later.   Gave this location 2 stars because the food was good. But I'd rather much go to the fort apache location or russell location. Better service.", "Date": "2016-11-04", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Cynthia", "ReviewID": "ynNbrenMhf40sk8b-wPpKQ", "Overall": "3", "Content": "The hamburger was the only thing had a good flavor, but I think very expensive for it. They gave a receipt of $45 at the beginning then when I was going to sign it was different price of $65 they didn't say anything for it no even a sorry or anything they just charged me $ 65. Frankly I don't think I will come back. Service was 3/5. They charge for extra for salsa or sauces.", "Date": "2016-12-17", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Janette", "ReviewID": "zhbdXxcBJxn9GGb3FlJfVw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I have been to Bachi several times, by myself, with family, with friends and each and every time consistently this place produces! The BEST burger ever! Whatever you choose from protein style, to turkey, to wish they had buffalo but that is another story. They prepare for you! The staff keeps you happy and the drinks full! Love love love their green tea! No matter where you sit from the bar, to any seat in the house you are made to feel comfortable and never rushed despite the waiting line to get in!", "Date": "2015-07-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jessica", "ReviewID": "zcG0Bb7Tf47qXj84ir8hfQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "The food is ALWAYS great.  Went back last week after restraining myself for MONTHS and saw a few new items.  My BF tried the Manga Burger and I had the Mr. Ho's.  I preferred my selection over his, but they are definitely very different!  The Mr. Ho's burger is perfection, with the lapcheong (Chinese Sausage), and taro bun! That screamed greatness off the menu!   The Manga has a very subtle taste,still good,  but paled in comparison to the Mr. Ho's I had that was BURSTING with flavor.   They've upped the portions on the fries, and somehow I believe the Garlic Salt & Pepper fries have been improved! Unless I just hadn't had them in very long. Regardless, the flavor is always on point.  We also had a chance to try their special dessert, the Grilled Mochi Sundae. We both loved it! The grilled mochi atop azuki (red bean) sauce and a scoop of green tea ice cream in the middle with matcha powder sprinkled all over! Simple, but wonderful.   I can't wait to go back in a few more months and hope they have more items added on to the menu!  Bachi never disappoints me. oh, and rumor has it, they may be opening another location... shhhh...", "Date": "2011-10-11", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Char", "ReviewID": "HjXir2SCuto_MG1CQ4nqxw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Really good burgers. Super juicy and not just average Burgers. I had the kalbi burger that was super flavorful (nice and spicy!) And my boyfriend had the banh mi burger. He ate it super fast so I assume it was really good. The calamari is also really good (although the mint leaves made some pieces taste funny) and the fries were nice and crispy. Close to the rent a car distribution place, so If you're picking up your car I recommend going here! Or go here before you board your flight .", "Date": "2016-06-22", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Karen", "ReviewID": "m8h90gIGZYqX5h1Cq8ww3w", "Overall": "1", "Content": "I used to love this place. But the service is getting worse and worse every time we visit. Just tonight we came to eat here and left speechless. The server named Bianca told us to wait when there were empty tables. She was rude and showed such attitude when we asked to sit in tables instead of the bar. There are 3-4 empty small tables and that is why we dont get what her problem is. When we finally got seated, my bf went to restroom to wash his hands. I was waiting to order. My bf's experience with the restroom was horrendous. Dirty, no soap, no paper towel. When he got back I was still waiting to order. There were 4-5 servers walking around without helping anyone. I should mention that there was no one coming to even offer us a glass of water. Needless to say we left feeling terrible. We love bachi burgers and every time we decide to come we think of how delicious our burgers are gonna be. But the service put us off every time. I'm sorry but I dont think i will step foot in here anymore because the service sucks. I hope the owners would come and check this place out cuz i think the employees ruined the good name you built for your place.", "Date": "2015-05-21", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Sherwin", "ReviewID": "wtW5ZRK7htgpImym8kPugQ", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Let me just say that the stars are strictly for the amazing food.  I've ordered every possible burger and appetizer on the menu and have yet to be disappointed.  The service is really hit or miss though. By the look of the staff there's consistently new faces so there's an obvious turnover problem.  At times we thought we'd get around that by just ordering takeout but that's only if they decide to pick up the phone.  Don't get me wrong though we've had some very positive dining experiences too. Unfortunately we've had one too many dining disappointments that we'll only go here at very off peak times or if we're really craving that Miyagi burger and oxtail chili fries.", "Date": "2015-12-27", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Girl", "ReviewID": "HICRHXKVxjRfKA9IxxhTdw", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Got the Ox tail chili fries. Very good.I think this is the best thing I have tried so far. The chili is really nice,with the thinly sliced jalapeño.  Tried the Miyagi san for the first time. I prefer the Kiki. As usual burger a bit on the heavy side.(miyahgi) But next time I may just try a plain bachi burger. The meat is so good it doesn't need all the sauces and stuff. Also to try: The turkey burger, because I rarely eat red meat.

There was probably about 6 of us and I got the Kiki burge r and sweet potatoe fries. We probably waited an hour before our food came out. The burger was good, the waiting part of it...NO BUENO!!...The guy comes out and asks how things are, one of they guys at my table ask how long it takes to make one of these burgers. Dude says about 12 minutes...12 minutes?....and it took you guys an hour to bring the food out?..what is it a one burner grill in the back or something??...besides the wait.. the burgers are good, small, but good.", "Date": "2010-06-17", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Corina", "ReviewID": "6bhzomgUZ-aNcKPWH58cjQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I love asian fusion burgers, e.g., Fukuburger.  It actually reminds me of a burger I had on my honeymoon in the Cook Islands -- hello, egg!     These are gourmet burgers, so some burgers are slightly more pricey than the average burger at a restaurant.  But it's so worth it!  According to one waitress, the popular burgers tend to be the Ronin burger and Kiki's burger.  I can attest that the Kiki burger is delicious; the ingredients mesh together such that they complement each other (sweet and tangy) and there's no one overwhelming flavor.           And the fries -- oh, the fries! The burgers don't come with fries, so you gotta order them separately.  The salt and pepper garlic fries are simply a must try.  The fries are shoestring, with cilantro and jalapeños.  Just a great combination of ingredients that results in french fried goodness! And without the need of excessive drenching in sauce.  As a tip, the front entrance to the restaurant is NOT the door facing Windmill.  The place is in a strip mall (surprise, surprise), and there's a walkway and door on the Windmill side.  BUT, the entrance is actually on the other side -- facing inside the strip mall.    I'm a fan of this place and will definitely return!", "Date": "2011-12-11", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Mary", "ReviewID": "R0WKDfaKuhQjX8lNAUQFig", "Overall": "3", "Content": "I came here with sky-high expectations. The people I know who've eaten here told me amazing things, but I found the food was just okay. The burgers and fries were good, but needed salt and pepper. So basic. I felt like they rely on sauces to make up for a lot of the flavor. The other thing I didn't like is that the menu has a lot of Asian items I'm unfamiliar with. While I consider myself an adventurous eater, I want to have a pretty good idea of what I'm ordering. I did ask the waiter to explain a few items, but I ended up going for a safe choice.   Bottom line, there was nothing  wrong  with the food, but I'm not going to go home and crave the food from Bachi Burger. Honestly, In-N-Out is better, and cheaper.", "Date": "2013-07-07", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jamie", "ReviewID": "d24C5nGYZD6FFFfMpOjS0g", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Had heard this place was good and stumbled in for an impromptu early lunch this windy Saturday morning. Just the smell coming from the kitchen was enough to entice us! These were probably the best burgers we had other than homemade in a very long time. The combination of spices, sweet fish sauce, mushrooms, on the Kiki burger were perfect.  I loved the sweet, zesty flavor. We shared the two burgers and the other was the Black and Green burger. This burger had a total earthy, warm delicious flavor. What The buns were steamed and grilled to perfection. The burgers were a good size but not so overwhelmed with toppings that they were messy or difficult to eat. I would highly recommend this stop and according to the table next to us the Portuguese doughnuts were delicious for dessert!", "Date": "2012-11-10", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
