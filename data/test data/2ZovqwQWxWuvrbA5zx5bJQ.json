Dirty, crowded with stands, crap shoved in every open space and claustrophobic.  Clean the place up, take out half the stands and get the employees to stop cussing in front of the customers.", "Date": "2015-07-04", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Isa", "ReviewID": "citwrFDOfNhs18YK6bLSSA", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Black cashier takes his sweet time and chats making a long line to purchase items. Was rude when I asked him to pick up the pace. Gave rude comments, was about to punch him in the face but was really in a hurry. I asked for his name and manager's number... didn't give the number.   I will go to corporate and complain to get his ass fired.", "Date": "2012-04-02", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Stephanie", "ReviewID": "eb5cVXAkK6GevGwljEQUNw", "Overall": "1", "Content": "As far as convenience goes, I should be buying gas and last minute essentials here on a weekly basis. I live right there and it would be the simplest stop to make. But I find myself driving out of my way to avoid this place at all costs. The people who work here seriously hate their job and hate me for pulling them away from their cigarette break to dare purchase anything. Try asking them a question and they mighty as well tell you to eff off. Give them a gift card and holy Jesus! Watch your back when you leave. It's the same two people I've dealt with almost every time. I don't understand how they are still employed here let alone anywhere else. Not to be mean but The owner obviously doesn't do drug tests. It's just a sad disgusting place.", "Date": "2014-04-08", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Vegas", "ReviewID": "6rsOBRWB0rchlBl6LR8zQg", "Overall": "3", "Content": "This convenience store is on Gibson at the 215.   It's really close and they have gas and car wash besides just corner store. But everything is just off a bit.  The car wash doesn't do as very good job and this store kinda has a grunge thing going all over.  Staff is shaky in more ways than one and again just one off  They would normally get a lower rating except I keep going here for my convenience when I am too lazy to go to a real store. Since I dont stop coming in, I cant bitch too much - its OK I guess.

I always seem to push my car as far as it will go and have cruised in here on empty, praying that I make it off the 215.  I've never actually been inside the store, so I can't say anything about the employees - however, in general I find most gas station attendants hate their jobs.  It's not exactly glamorous.  LOL  I always pay at the pump.  Prices aren't the highest I've seen, but they also aren't the lowest.  I prefer to gas up somewhere else, but will continue to stop here when I can't make it anywhere else!  I've never felt any concern for my safety or noticed any shady individuals...", "Date": "2013-02-22", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Andrea", "ReviewID": "W7DsbrgLkZ8UZz2anqHNvA", "Overall": "1", "Content": "I live right across the street from the Speedee Mart.  A lot of the businesses in the plaza (and the apartments across the street) are pretty decent.  So why is it, then, that I always feel like I'm just waiting to get capped when I get gas at the Speedee Mart?    Maybe it's because I have been in this gas station right after a robbery (true).  Maybe it's because I have been accosted by thugs and told about my  thickness  in no uncertain terms ( oooh girl, you so fine... ) (sadly, this is true too).  Maybe it's because the gentleman mentioned in Isa's review from 4/1 refuses to stop texting during a transaction and only makes grunting sounds when interacting with customers (I don't know if he knows any actual words).  Whatever the reason, I don't even feel safe getting out of my car at this gas station.  Tonight my fianc√© remarked,  oh, the gas truck is here refilling the pumps!  Good!  That means we might not get murdered tonight because there will be witnesses!   And he was joking, but only a smidgin'.  There's something WRONG with this place.  Just stay away.  Seriously.   Take my word for it.", "Date": "2012-04-07", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Annemarie", "ReviewID": "e39xZwEMluNa6dSDX7d_sQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I used to live near here and would get my gas station coffee here EVERYDAY!   I have not been here in about 18 months!   I walked in with my thermos and SABRINA the clerk remembered me like one day has not gone by!  Now that is killer customer service!   I am obsessed with the choices of cream, flavored syrups, sweeteners and of course the customer service!   Thank you for making my morning brought on this grey day SABRINA!", "Date": "2016-08-23", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Paul", "ReviewID": "FO7-P7O3fiVfqwy2heNtzA", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Beware the sign that posts the gas prices.  This is one of the places that you have to read the small print.  There is another smaller sign that says you pay more if you use a credit card.  No big deal? I say that it all adds up.  This is also one of those places that seems to tack on a few cents here and there when it comes to the specials on water, Rockstars or other things for that matter.   Beware the car wash. You would do better to just use the squeegee and clean your car at the pumps.  Laziness has brought me here many times.  Now that I have said my piece, I shall make peace (with myself) and just head down the road a little further.", "Date": "2011-08-31", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Nick", "ReviewID": "thsDYtvnNxe_cnOVPYAPFQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Great gas station, always busy but nice employees!
