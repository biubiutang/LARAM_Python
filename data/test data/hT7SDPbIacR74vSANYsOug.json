It's a circular bar with typical bar/lounge low chairs and tables around it. If there was a cocktail waitress assisting the folks not sitting at the bar I never saw her. The bartenders are friendly, albeit not particularly attentive or speedy. There are several fancy cocktails, as well as bottled beers and wines by the glass to choose from. All over-priced, of course. While the draft beers are just the crap stuff, the bottled list was pleasant and better than most casino bars. The bar is designed to be hip and modern. It's far from a lobby bar I would deliberately visit. But when walking about the LINQ Hotel (a.k.a. Imperial Palace), it's a pleasant discovery.", "Date": "2015-05-20", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Lauren", "ReviewID": "SSkVu_qYNVTGNTRm-EjMmg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "We recently went on a girls weekend to Vegas and stayed at the Linq. We quickly discovered the awesome 3535 bar and made that our home base and meeting spot. The music is fun, drinks are great and decently priced - especially during Happy Hour when you can get their craft cocktails for $8! You can sit at the bar and play video blackjack too :)   Our bartender Ryan was phenomenal! He made excellent drinks, was attentive and gave great recommendations on our first night.   I can't wait to go back and try all the seasonal cocktails at 3535.", "Date": "2016-12-13", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "John", "ReviewID": "15Ck9WUaJl2IlRzzNz4yIg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "This bar is so great. I feel that it isn't given its credit since there is not enough signage and that the wonderful infused spirits are not highlighted.  Such a waste that this great bar is shadowed by its location.

Located in the Linq hotel, 3535 is a solid place to drink and people watch at the same time. Beer, wine, cocktails this bar has all the bases covered, but without the normal casino prices.  There are also about six private booth areas for you and your party to hang and sip before heading into the craziness that is the strip. These private booths not only offer privacy, but also power outlets and recharge stations for your cell phone, so there's never a missed selfie moment. Great place to also get some work done if you have some Strip located meetings, great Wi-Fi here.   Headed to the Linq?

The staff are friendly and talented, the vortex-y, raised bar space is sleek, and the cocktails are amazing. This became our nightly drinking spot, and when the others went off to gamble or watch acrobats fly through the air, I stayed here to play video poker and drink more. Even when I got a bit tipsy, the staff accommodated my chatter like pros, and kindly introduced me to their preferred cocktails. I could have tried everything on the menu, but here's how far I got:  Chai Peanut Butter Cup - Let me state clearly, I do not do  syrup cocktails,  those goopy, food-colored concoctions of many regretful mornings after, but as sweet cocktails go, this one is absolutely perfect. It really tastes like a peanut butter cup, the chai tea brings it down to earth, and its sweetness is earned. It was everyone's favorite and the guilty pleasure we returned to night after night.  Blackberry Bite - Black-pepper and blackberry-infused Knob Creek with lemon, sage, and ginger beer, holy cow this was a wonderful drink. It was my last one on my last night and if I'd had it sooner, I'd probably still be in Vegas right now on the floor of 3535.   Agave Dreams - This barrel-infused cocktail was the favorite of two different bartenders, and when I finally tried it, I could see why. The Patron, agave, and hint of cinnamon and brown sugar go down like a fancy hooker.   Espresso Bourbon - Maker's + espresso beans, simple but rich and robust.   JFK - Blue cheese and olive-infused gin martini, the crisp gin washes down the savory cheese very well.   Pig Newton - Bacon-infused Jim Bean and fig-infused Jack Honey, smooth but less memorable than the other drinks.   There's a solid Happy Hour from 3-6pm, and the drinks go from $13 to $2 while actively gambling, so why not put the cocktail cash into a chance to win big? (I didn't win big.) I don't think I can ever go back to playing in the corners of casinos while waiting for my tiny well cocktails.", "Date": "2015-07-31", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Pam", "ReviewID": "YUAuWAkkYDuK4H0bGm6QzA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "While staying at the Linq, this was my go to bar. It's located right in the middle of the hotel so, a good spot to people watch lol. The happy hour menu is pretty decent. There were more selections than I expected. The red blend house wine wasn't too bad :) I had a good pour for $6. A top shelf cocktail will run you about $10. For the most part, service was okay however, there was one bartender that was really annoying. I hate interacting with arrogant people.

Since I intended to get very buzzed before getting on the ride, I ordered a few strong cocktails and shots, and they worked!   The drink menu is very extensive, they have many crafted cocktails and infusion shots, the eye candy bartender Amanda made us a few ones she invented by herself, we just told her what we preferred, what liquor, what flavor, she did a great job accommodating our requests. I liked the vodka ones with spicy flavor so much.  I loved it they put diamond shaped ice in cocktails, it was nice! The bartenders were extremely friendly, they were so much fun to hang with! Drinks were very strong, but inexpensive, I got really buzzed getting on the High Roller ride, so I got to enjoy the ride without the fear of heights this time!

There was a large picture of a Bloody Mary concoction with a piece of bacon protruding high above the glass rim. I started salivating over the photo and told my wife,  we have to go here!   We found the bar right next to the concierge desks.  It was about 9 am and the bar tender was prepping for open. Chris, was his name, was kind enough to explain the bars concept on infusion drinks: using pantry favorites to evolve and expand the modern cocktail varietals. We decided to return for our first tasting during happy hour, 3-6pm. Chris remembered us and took our orders: the BBQ Bloody Mary (no bacon to be found...kinda bummed) and my wife's Wat-A-Pear. He made the drinks well and was informative about the flavors in each. He even offered us small samplers of the infusions the bar was known for. I tried the cookie dough infused Grand Marnier cherry liqueur. Not my favorite but it was nice to try before buying.  Winding down we tried our last drink which Chris had informed us was just being introduced. It was a peach infused Jim Bean Bourbon with a light orange zest and orange peel for garnish.  My wife fancies vodka and she loved this more than her Wat-A-Pear drink (vodka based).  Never thought I would see the day my wife drank bourbon.  Hats off to you Chris, we will be back for more!", "Date": "2015-07-14", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jade", "ReviewID": "Os-o3fEkHELTaNbeyXCr8w", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Enjoy cocktails?  Inventive craft cocktails?  Elevated a little off casino level of Linq hotel is this circular bar, one of the Strip's few infusion bars.  Menu boasts custom ingredients.  Grimlet is a classic gimlet infused with house-made green tea syrup, mint-infused Hendrick's gin, fresh lime, cardomom bitters.  Ruby Rose is an infusion martini:  rose honey and raspberry-infused Beefeater gin, St. Germain liqueur, cranberry juice, splash of house-made grenadine.  Pig Newton (for whiskey and bourbon aficionados) is made with fig-infused Jack Daniel's Honey and ancho-chile Maker's Mark.  It's *supposed* to get an extra kick of delicious-ness via bacon salt on the rim.  When made right, the concoction is outstanding.  When they're out of this special salt and water the thing down?  Disappointment.  Wat-a-pear = watermelon- and rosemary-infused Tito's vodka, St. Germain and fresh watermelon juice.  Good, if lighter on the alcohol.  El Fuego = mango, citrus and jalapeño-infused Sauza tequila, agave nectar, mango purée, house-made sour mix.  Apple-cinnamon Old Fashioned = apple cinnamon-infused Bulleit bourbon, 151 rum-soaked cherry and torched orange garnish.  Another dessert type is Mint Oreo Martini.  The Mule is mint- and ginger-infused Stoli vodka with Domainde Canton liqueur, muddled lime, topped with a splash of ginger beer garnished with candied ginger.  At one point, 3535 made a great Bloody Mary.   Garden  version was a tall glass of spicy tomato-ness with two bleu-cheese stuffed olives and a strip of candied peppered bacon.  It was served over unique ice cubes, 1.5-inches frozen water blocks.  Their original bar chairs (as seen in following link) were stylish and comfy.  https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/X-dWfG1AMUAv9cTRTlUWKA/o.jpg  Now?  Gone.  Replaced by fug brown Naugahyde-ish wobbly stools you can't wait to escape.  The alternatives are open lounge round seating, or one of the back booths with monitors airing Screenplay Entertainment, music videos of mostly electronic dance music or pop artists.  On certain days a d-j sets up in a corner and blasts tunes.  Having frequented enough since its opening, I'd gladly rate it higher if things were consistent and less hit-and-miss.  Trajectory went from very good to 'wth happened to the tasty dranx'.  Perhaps the key is getting the right bartender.  But still... with all the bar/lounge options in walking distance, 3535 should, and can, be better.", "Date": "2016-06-01", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ramiro", "ReviewID": "Dk5-BJIqgIEK_XM5L0hE5Q", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I stayed at the LINQ and this Bar is in the Casino portion.
