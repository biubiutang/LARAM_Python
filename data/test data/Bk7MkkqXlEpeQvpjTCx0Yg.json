We walked in and no one else was there other than the 4 employees. After we ordered, a group of 3 came in and ordered. Not only did they get their food first, they were just about finished. It took 25 minutes from order to being served.   The hot sub was served wrapped up with a   small amount of potato salad on the wrapper so I needed to rip it open so the ps wasn't all over the table.  They advertise Boars Head meat but their pastrami tasted more like corned beef.

Lots of quality Boar's Head meat. I had the Baccarat (hot pastrami, grilled onion, melted Swiss, deli mustard) and my husband had the 3-Card Monte (Genoa salami, pepperoni, ham, provolone).

The booth table was wobbly, we moved to the next one.   We were there at 12:00 for lunch and ordered the soup and sandwich combo (was told the soup would be  a few more minutes - not ready) ,  we werent told our sandwiches were ready (we had to ask) and pickup.   However, our soup was never told it was ready.  We waited patiently as the clock ticked and we waited for OVER 1 hour for a cup of soup and we had to ask for it almost when we were done.   This is really a take-out place even if there are tables and chairs there.    Staff is extremely slow.   It is hard to find, and in a Gamblers Store.

Found this place by accident while surfing Groupon. The location is a small cafe with about 30 seats inside of a gambling gift shop near Downtown and Freemont Street. It is kind of off the beaten path and if you didn't know it was there, it would be easy to miss.   Three of us stopped in for breakfast on a Saturday. When we arrived, we were the only ones in the cafe and were greeted promptly. The staff were extremely friendly and told us to take our time. He (Efrain?) was also very courteous when I presented the Groupon... some places give you attitude.   The food, while not huge... was large enough per serving,  fresh and quite tasty.   Three things that made me happy... 1) They have Wise potato chips 2) They have salt bagels 3) The cleanliness  The cafe portion was very clean and the employees washed their hands three times while helping us... I'm a germaphobe, so I notice these things! Thank you!  If you are in the area, The Gambler's Cafe is a good, quick stop for a light, simple breakfast or sandwich.

We decided to give it a try due to their no-frills menu, reasonable prices and a special they were running on Yelp.  Doesn't appear to be a cafe as it is housed in the Gambler's Supply store.  The cafe umbrellas out front gave us the only impression of offering food!  We ordered a bagel, a bagel egg breakfast sandwich, bacon, coffee and juices.  As the only patrons, food came out very quick.  Only complaint was that the coffee was extremely strong!!  Diluted with water and it was still too bold.  Give this place a try!!

Since we are working downtown, sometimes these folks that show up at the door can be a little....sketchy. But this time, we were pleasantly surprised. They gave us a handful of samples of fresh bagels they had made and started talking to us about their business. Gamblers Cafe. All fresh ingredients. The meats used are Boar's Head Brand. They deliver for a tiny fee of $1.50. They have fresh baked goods delivered every morning, etc. All of this was very intriguing. Plus, I think we were all getting bored of the usual Jimmy Johns order. So, we called them up for lunch. (Seems like the old fashioned door to door sales still works, especially when you get to sample the goods)   We all ordered sandwiches. And all of us agreed they were delicious. We also ordered a cookie and a doughnut. Cause, why not? I ordered the Loaded Dice which was a ham and turkey with bacon. (All In, which is their version of the works) It was huge and it was delicious. The ONLY complaint that I have is in regards to the bread. It was a little overwhelming and it was hard to bite through. Your sandwich is practically served on a loaf of french bread which is amazing because you get real bang for your buck but, it was maybe a little too big. Other than that, excellent. It was loaded with seasonings as well and definitely not lacking in flavor. It tasted like it came from a true NY Deli. Or at least what I imagine would be a true NY Deli...because I have not really been to one.   We will all be happily ordering from here again and I suggest the same to everyone else as well.
