The wait was ridiculous and my rolled tacos were cold and hard. Months later.... I gave em another shot. This time I tried their chicken tacos special. Packed full of chicken with good flavor, even the rice and beans were tasty.  Went inside this time and had much quicker service and got to sample all of their salsas from the salsa bar. Everything was hot and tasted fresh.

They have really good selection of food as well as a kids menu. Daily specials. Which is great. I like that every time I have been here the food is always made fresh to order, even when going through the drive thru. Fries are crispy. Not stale or soggy. The horchata and pineapple water are very good. The kids are served an organic / low calorie (40) / gluten free fruit drink. Which is way better than soda packed with sugar anywhere else and my son loves their churros.", "Date": "2016-07-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "B", "ReviewID": "k5P2qpKsvhUu7n-MUT0TGw", "Overall": "3", "Content": "You might be better off ordering inside than using the drive thru. I don't know if they rehired some of the staff from this building when it housed A&W/Long John Silver, but they move equally as slowly.  Pull up to the window, turn off the engine, and turn up the music because you'll be there for a while. What earns them an additional star is the fact that the ladies at the window are friendly.   The food is only slightly better than Roberto's, there's nothing much to say about it.", "Date": "2016-05-16", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Yvette", "ReviewID": "sw5O3IclcU2dukR-rc7Gcw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Me acabo de mover de Phoenix  y extranaba mucho la comida de alla hasta q Encontr este restaurante,me recuerda mucho a Arizona,ahora no puedo dejar de comer Les recomiendo mucho la adovada y los tacos de pescado tambien si Les gusta comer adentro siempre esta muy limpio el comedor y los ba√±os", "Date": "2016-09-25", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Billy", "ReviewID": "q9hwiAX1EW2p_5I4MmP4rA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Thank goodness that these guys came into the East Valley! They just took over the old Rolibertos that was absolutely disgusting for years. The other few Filibertos around aren't a whole lot better. This place is actually pretty damn good! It's easy to think that every single one of these places is exactly the same but each one has just a touch different flare to their menus and this place is no exception. The prices are much more reasonable than Filibertos, and the actual spices that they put in their products make the food tastes so much better.

Burrito was  full of carne asada but that was about all no rice r  beans then had to add sour cream and cheese for 99 cent each. Ask for the pico on the side to my surprise didn't receive it at all only to also notice that they also didn't  give me my change n the drive thru.

This is my second time eating here, and it's OK. The guacamole is awesome along with the salsa bar. I custom made a burrito since I'm vegan. It was ok and very bland. The red sauce was delish. However, the green sauce was way too salty. My wife had fish tacos and said they were also bland and needed seasoning. She said the fish had way too much breading and could barely taste the fish. They have a daily special for the weekdays and a 2.99 daily breakfast burrito. I'll come here when I'm craving late night Mexican to support a small business.

I'm not gonna say the food is bad. It's good. Nothing crazy, but it's good. Only complain the last time I was there was that there's only 2 people working. The cook and the cashier. When I walked I cashier was on the bathroom I guess. So I waited at least 10 mins. All in all it took me about 30+ mins to walk out with a burrito and some carne asada fries. I'm not gonna say I won't go back. Maybe one day when it's one of those days when you just don't know what else to get.", "Date": "2016-06-24", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Alan", "ReviewID": "Ka3ED9qirVxPEH--cUiKEA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I live close to where this restaurant is located, and even though I drive every day to go to work yesterday was my first time trying their food, I was more surprised knowing that it has been opened for 6 months already.

Whenever I'm near Nellis, it's hard to resist a stop by Rilibertos! Despite the similar name, this place has no affiliation with Robertos and has WAY better food and service.  The breakfast burritos are a favorite item, ordered all the way, packed with ham and dipped in their awesome salsa verde- and it's like $3. Their regular burritos are also good, but my guy tends to order their plates. They have late HH discounts and coupons to make their already low prices even lower- if you spend more than $7/person, you're pretty much guaranteed leftovers.", "Date": "2017-01-08", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
