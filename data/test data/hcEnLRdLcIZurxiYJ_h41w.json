I've been going to this location for about a year as it is the closest to my house. However, I am going to be willing to change up my morning routine to avoid coming here.  As many others have pointed out, this is somewhat of a training location. Staff changes on a weekly basis. You may never know who will wait on you. The staff that does remain is a mixed bunch. Some take the time to get to know you, your order, etc. Others do not. It is apparent which ones are which.   The morning team cannot keep up with the demand of the location. It's sad when a drink takes 20 minutes to make. There is no method to the madness. If you go inside, they don't put your cups in the bunch with the drive-thru orders. So, be sure to ask for your drink.   The drive-thru in the mornings is a scene outside of the Hunger Games. If you don't time it right in the morning, you're stuck going in. If you do stick the drive- thru out, there is no order to pulling in. I'm actually shocked there hasn't been an accident or a fist-fight. People cut you off.  If you make it into the drive-thru expect to wait a good 10-15 minutes. I've constantly been faced with getting a drink and then having to go back inside as they made my drink wrong.    The inside of the Starbucks is not the nicest. It needs a good cleaning somedays.

Well let me begin with saying you get what you pay for!  Yes, coffee is cheaper at 7-11.  That doesn't mean the coffee is anywhere near as good as what Starbucks sells.    I ordered my standard of venti nonfat decaf latte.  It was perfectly prepared and served hot to the sip.  Ask for a stopper if you want your brew to stay hot until you arrive at your destination.    The baristas here at this specific Starbucks are friendly and work the drive-thru line very fast.  I was behind more than 5 cars and was through the line no less than 6 minutes!  I would say that it's always busy during  rush hour  in the morning.  Rush hour being between 7:45am and 9:00am.

The crew seems to be ever changing (not sure if this is due to the fact that this location is deemed a training facility or not), more often than not they get my order wrong, & and one time I swear I was served a drink made with sour soy milk. (I of course asked the Barista to remake it--which I don't like to have to do, but the first one tasted so bad it churned my stomach for the entire day) Furthermore, I find this all very unfortunate considering the fact that this location is very spacious and has a great amount of seats & plug-ins to hang out and use the free Wi-fi. However, the last few visits I opted out of coffee & only ordered tea to try to enjoy the atmosphere--big mistake! I usually enjoy the hustle and bustle of a coffee shop, even find it to be soothing, but not here. Way too noisy!

The only con is this place is always busy (which is great) but in turn they run out of things very often but they usually never miss a beat and always double check orders.

Now, I'm not one of those normal Starbuckers who knows all the lingo, so this past time I went I asked for a  pump  of hazelnut in my coffee (I wanted to sound cool!) and the lady asks  just one? or do you want a set?  WTF?! I froze! I was like  Uh yea, the second one  I could hear her laughing, then a man came on and repeated my order.   Not nice Starbucks lady! Anywho, my iced coffee tasted like shit, but my son loved his warm cocoa and the mini scones I purchased for the bf's dr and receptionist looked HELLA yummy!!

This is not the Starbucks experience that I am used to, and because of this will no longer be coming to any Starbucks location.    I came to Summerlin to visit my grandmother and went through the drive thru to order two drinks.   As I got home and tasted the drinks, it appears they were made incorrectly (wrong milk and wrong tea blend).   I figured I would call and let someone know.   The person who answered told me they would remake the drinks.   The next day I went back to the store and told them about the drinks and the Manager was extremely abrasive and asked for the receipt.    I told him I don't normally keep my receipts but that it was purchased in my Starbucks card, and to look it up on my card.   He arguably told me he could not look it up on the card and I needed to download the Starbucks app.    Okay, now the arguing needs to stop right here!!!!     I told the manager I spoke to someone who told me to come back.   He continued to argue with me and told me I need a receipt, and that his team doesn't mess up on drinks.  At that point I walked away and asked for his district Manager phone number  to let him/her know what type of customer experience they are providing.  As of today (6 days later) no call back from District Manager.    No more Starbucks for me!   Customer service is more important than coffee!  I will be going to Petes from now on.", "Date": "2016-05-03", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Dominique", "ReviewID": "kt4x5paayRMF0B_fx_xlKQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I am not a Starbucks person. In my late teens, I loved Starbucks. A 24 hour coffee house when I was under the age of 21 was where it was at! However... As my taste for great coffee improved... My love and tolerance for Starbucks declined. I will say that they are located in every major grocery store... On every major corner of every neighborhood... And now In target... And hospitals... So they must be doing something right. Because of the later hours of this location and convenience... I find myself sitting in this coffee shop to study quite often, drinking tolerable coffee... And tea.   The parking... Well... It sucks. Park by Baja Fresh and walk so your car doesn't get hit. The ambiance of the place is pretty typical of Starbucks... Lots of uncomfortable seating... Tables... Convenient outlets... The usual... Dim Lighting :), soft music, and cold cold air in the winter... I'm not sure they use the heater.  The service is always fast and efficient. They don't over charge me for a quarter cup of warm soy milk in my coffee... And they are always welcoming. Remember to Tip for good service.   The products are consistent. Usually overly acidic for my taste... But... Always consistent. I can appreciate them offering lighter sides to their high calorie drinks. My favorite winter drink to order here is tea... Unless I need a big boost... And it's always a medium triple shot soy sf vanilla latte... I don't venture out of the box often to avoid disappointment with the place. They are getting four stars...

(Try it sometime, trust me.)  I was running back to work after a doctor appointment, needing a quick snack and beverage because I hadn't had lunch yet.    The girl at the drive thru was pleasant, she informed me that the sandwich I ordered wasn't available so she suggested another.  She handed me the sandwich and the Very Berry Hibiscus Refresher and I took off.  I later noticed that my drink, usually a lovely shade of lavender, was mostly white.  I shook it to mix up the berries, but it was still a pale pink.  There were only about three berries with some fragments in my cup.    Additionally, I had asked for  light ice , since they usually fill the entire cup with ice leaving you about five good gulps, but you can see from the photo that the cup is full of ice.

The clerk mentioned he and the other staff all leave at 6pm tonight for a meeting to this other customer. I hope someone reads this review to tell them they need to acknowledge other customers. Once the young clerk finally saw me looking at my watch, he then said he would be right with me. There was a line starting to form at that time. The counter top was dirty with the previous customer trying out his sample drinks and it was not cleaned. The clerk got my drink wrong 2 times before I paid and when it was finally made by a young Asian girl, it was wrong again. She never apologized for making the wrong drink. There was a heavy set white girl working the window that kept saying she wants to eat all the caramel, I assumed she did by her size. And to think, I left a $1.00 tip in the jar when other people left small change. I would never go back to this facility again.", "Date": "2016-10-25", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
