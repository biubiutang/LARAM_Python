They have also renamed it to Great China and lowered the prices on their lunch specials.  I think my Kung Pao Chicken, rice, eggroll and hot-n-sour soup was $5.45   The food was good, service much better and it is very clean inside.  This is a big improvement from half a year ago when the prior owners had started to let the place really go down hill.

I've tried different dishes each time I've ordered, hoping my dissatisfaction was just from my selections. I was wrong. After receiving my order tonight, I will not be ordering from here any longer. The delivery service is fine, but the food quality is just not good. Everything is coated in tons of oil, and has a really fake taste. You can tell cheap ingredients are used. None of the dishes I've ordered were good enough to want to order again. For the prices they charge, they really need to step up their game.

The restaurant looks like an older run down place serving up Americanized Chinese food. The whole time I was sitting inside and reading the menu I felt unsure if I really wanted to eat here but I told myself I should at least try it since I was there. I ordered a beef chow fun to go since it's kind of hard to mess that dish up so I figured I was safe.   When my order was ready it was handed to be in a bag where I noticed they didn't provide utensils or chopsticks but I was too lazy to go back in since I was already in the car. Strike 1. When I opened the box I noticed that the portions were way smaller than most other Chinese places while they are charging a full entree price ($8.50-10.00)  for everything including the beef chow fun. Strike 2. The beef was fully cooked but had a weird taste to it and the dish overall just seemed bland. Strike 3.   I would not recommend this place at all and even Panda Express would be a better choice since their food has more flavor. This place also has a $20 card minimum so bring cash if you're not going to be spending over 20 bucks, which I'm sure is not hard to do here.", "Date": "2014-04-15", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "WatrBearer", "ReviewID": "CmFpIIIwfHIv297vLgABYw", "Overall": "3", "Content": "General to chicken not real spicy without asking works for us but the broccoli garnish was frozen...Curry is fine for casual dining....

I was observing her childish behavior while trying to enjoy lunch with my parents today. She was yelling and demanding free items and threatening the manager to go somewhere else that gives her free things down the street (she was only ordering three things and an appetizer). The manager agreed to give her something free and she still wasn't happy.  She then accused the manager of charging her too much and was talking to him like a three year old. The male that was with her said nothing and did nothing but stare at her causing a scene. What a pansy!   This place is great!   The food is delicious, the service is great, and the lunch special is a lot of food for a cheap price! ($5-7). It's even available on weekends until 4pm.  The place is very clean, despite the sort of tacky turquoise casino theme on the booths.   I come here often with my mom and we always order the Kung pao chicken and the cashew chicken lunch specials. I order the cashew chicken spicy or ask for the chile sauce on the side. The hot and sour soup and egg drop soup are both delicious, but are a bit thick (gelatinous), most likely from a cornstarch thickener or whatever they use.  The lunch special entrees are about half protein and half vegetables (which I like), and the Mongolian beef is just beef, white onions, and scallions. All lunch specials come with fried rice or chow mein, a cup of egg flower or hot and sour soup, and a spring roll.  I will definitely keep returning, and hope that they continue to provide delicious cheap Chinese food.", "Date": "2013-02-18", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Lily", "ReviewID": "eG7xiNsJ69exVeJfTzq8TQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Giving the combination fried rice five stars!
