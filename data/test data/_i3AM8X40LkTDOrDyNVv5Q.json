Debbie, a complete crap for brains decked in stereotypical biker/trailer attire, refused to sell to us because her own  personal reasons . I'm black, my husband is white, and my daughter (whom I adopted) is white. She didn't think to stop the family before us who, too purchased alcohol with younger children. My husband asked her  so you're telling me you're refusing to sell to me? That's illegal . Debbie stuttered and said  no it's not the law, but it's my own reason. You can call corporate, they know me very well . Angry, we left and I called the store and spoke to Ken. When I explained the situation to him, he was very perplexed as to why Debbie would react and behave in such a way. I demanded to see him, so we returned to the store. When my husband explained yet again what occurred, Ken told us that the reason Debbie refused to sell alcohol to us is because she overheard our daughter telling us what flavor of beer she wanted. First off, this is a flat out lie! My husband asked me what kind of beer I wanted, and I responded. How unreal to make up a lie to save your own ass? She has no idea about our backgrounds, or what we do professionally in our lives. Regardless, we took our business to Smith's where the customer service has been nothing short of amazing. Debbie, EEO will be contacted.", "Date": "2016-07-23", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Eddie", "ReviewID": "AP1VqOXnfeYnCj_IpwRyXQ", "Overall": "1", "Content": "People are very rude they don't know where any of their stuff in the store is and the cashier's check too long to check people out", "Date": "2016-10-30", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Perla", "ReviewID": "vuuMvu_2JhNRnd4GYXuA6Q", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Absolutely hate this place everyone I've  dealt with in the store is extremely rude I've  gone three times before i wrote this review and all three I've had a bad experience i will drive further down the road to Smiths to get a smile and better customer service!", "Date": "2015-02-10", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Lonnie", "ReviewID": "Bn-fSpNHP0UKDM8S2xEHWQ", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Never think to yourself that your gonna run to the store really quick! Especially if that store is Walmart. Mostly all checkers there have no sense of urgency and the people that shop there, wow!  So broke!  So broke that they're to blame for the lines because they're unable to pay for their crap. Why is it that I have to wait twenty minuets (not an exaggeration) to pay for my groceries with one person ahead of ME! While their other employees  act  like they got better things to do. There was a reason I stopped shopping at Walmart. For sure, I will never step foot in this place again!", "Date": "2014-11-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jack", "ReviewID": "09hl0GvnPSJgAcSvOiTUqQ", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Low quality product, clientele and employees.

The staff for the most part doesn't really care, so that is always a downer. Lately its hard to find the things we need.

They are usually out of everything that you might be looking for and they dont keep the store clean. Most of the produce is very sad looking and typically one cashier open (so plan on it taking about 20 min to check out). 2 stars for convenience (only other store within a few miles is smiths on centennial).", "Date": "2015-05-15", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Adlai", "ReviewID": "AYKx_OMRsMbpjdyxsG632A", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Manager is extremely rude and very uncaring.

They have most of what I'm looking for in a pinch and the prices are reasonable. Lines can be a bit long on busy evenings but that's just the way of the world. The managers and all the team are always trying their best.
