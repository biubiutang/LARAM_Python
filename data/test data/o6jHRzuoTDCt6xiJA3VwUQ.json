Now its a real pet peeve of mine when people consider themselves a self pro-claimed  Sushi Connoisseur.   Dahling, I've been to all the finest places and have had the finest, freshest fish!!  Turns out they've been to I Love Sushi twice and they became an expert on raw fish with a damn California Roll. Aside from my digression, I'm not an expert, but I know what I want and how I want it. That being said, this review is biased (but I guess you could say that about them all).    First time here, my friend and I missed the $1 off specials by a few minutes, but I was alright with that because we were there for a good time. I always order a garlic tuna and fatty tuna first as my  appetizer.  Yes, did those tunas appetize me! I've noticed many sushi restaurants have their own rendition of garlic tuna, usually just soaked in garlic ponzu, but this had a thin smear of wasabi and was actually topped with minced garlic. My mouth is watering as I type this, but I still would prefer the simple soaked in garlic ponzu... (I've had too much change these past months.. So maybe I'll adjust). And of course the fatty tuna melted its omega-3s far too quickly once it hit my tongue.. It's a love-hate kinda thing.   We shared 3 rolls: dynamite, volcano, and tiger eye. We enjoyed all 3, but not for their price and the fact that the selection of rolls seem to have the same innards but are spruced up by different fish on top and/or the sauces they are smothered in.  Food and service give this a 3.5-4/5, price knocks it down. I left satisfied, but could have easily eaten more. I think this is a fun neighborhood spot, but I prefer getting the same quality with more bang for my buck. Luckily, I have a $1 off the bill next time....", "Date": "2013-06-26", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "hWdaTdtATWIZC05Y02kQxw", "Overall": "3", "Content": "I had the chicken teriyaki + tempura combo and a ca roll for 11 on a monday afternoon.  - cheap deal! 5 bucks for the combo! 3 for the roll! 1 for a soda! - small combo portion. few pieces of chicken. 4 pieces of tempura (1 shrimp), tiny bit of mac salad, salad, rice and couple oranges. - good music! they were playing utada hikaru :) - fast and friendly service.  - nothing special with taste, but expected for what i got.  - good lunch in between work.", "Date": "2012-07-17", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Dean", "ReviewID": "YLTDpiJDmQooBaIaiyhRgw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "We like to go here every week.

One thing I should correct in my previous review is that they do a have a larger number of specials rolls than I mentioned before. You just need to look at the marker boards on the wall above the bar.  We got there early so take advantage of their early bird special. Between 5 and 6pm every sushi and food menu item is $1 off.  I went with my normal sushi fall backs: order of salmon, tuna, seared albacore in ponzu, and unagi. Couldn't be happier!  The wife and I also got shrimp and veggie tempura, which she claims is the best in Vegas and being raised in Japan you can't argue with her! Since the wife is a pregnant and decided to play it safe and not eat raw fish so she ordered futomaki (tomago aka Japanese omelette, crab stick, ginger, Japanese spinach). Definitely worth checking out for those of you who avoid eating raw fish.  We also ordered grilled squid and was shockingly tender, I only managed to get two pieces before the wife devoured it.

Sssaaaaiiihghhhht.  Fish is as fresh as any other neighborhood place in town is.  Meaning, Americans are too stupid to know the difference.  Nothing I ate had super stank face.  It's a decent enough spot but I personally found it lacking.  They had a ton of  special rolls  which were written untelligibly on a white-erase which might have been written in heiroglyphics.  Horrible marketing.    I got to spin this wheel.  Top price was $20.  Not 20%.  $20.  So much potential wasted.  The top prize is the price of a standard lap dance?  Fuck that.  The wheel is fun but offer something good or dont do it at all   As far as the food, Id classify it as standard Vegas neighborhood sushi with an extended wait period and too much  mayo.     Seriously I ordered salmon sashimi on a greed salad and was horrified to see the asian mayo on it. Thats not japanese, that's just stupid.  YEAH IM A FAT BOY but wtf.

There are no vegetarian choices on the lunch menu, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. The larger dinner menu though I did see more options. So we went with sushi. We ordered 5 rolls from a super awesome waitress and didn't have to wait too long to be served.   The place is tiny so you can hear everyone's conversations. Everyone was very friendly, the sushi chef was very talkative and talented at his job.   The sushi was amazing! We were stuffed after the rolls.

My friend went with the box lunch of fried aji and kara-age.   First was a bowl of miso soup. I love good miso soup, but this wasn't it. Not bad, but tasted a bit bland and generic.   The food was good, the fish very fresh, but again nothing out of this world good. Just very average place. My friend who is more into sushi than I am, said the same thing, and he liked ta-tas or I Love Sushi more. So I will try those places out next time.

The menu is very traditional but Chef Aki has an assortment of special rolls on his whiteboard next to the sushi counter.  We had the Rock N Roll roll and the Hello Kitty roll, which was my daughters favorite.  Sushi was extremely fresh and some of the best quality I've had here in Vegas and Henderson. You can tell Aki is a big fan of classic rock like the Beatles. Totally cool atmosphere and as I said earlier service was on point.  We didn't have to wait long for everything we ordered.

So let's break it down:  Gyoza: very good, had a bit of crunch to it Spicy Tuna: average, small roll with 8 pieces, mildly spicy. Not bad but not my favorite either. Hurricane- Ahi: good, recommended by our waitress this was a solid choice, tasty sauces. Japanese Lasagna: not for me, too unsushi-like, baked with cream cheese and a sweet sauce Hello Kitty: good, big roll with 8 pieces, sauce and tempura. I would probably order again.

Luckily Sushi Imagine is just a hop on the 2-15 from the shopping center, or just a street or two away.   At first I couldn't find it because my GPS was not being nice to me, but then I realized it was behind the McDonalds! If you get into the shopping center and can't find it... just look behind the fast food. ;)  The lunch specials, oh the lunch specials! Lunch specials for $5! And a big cup of soda for 95 cents! I opted though for the $7.95 lunch special - spicy tuna and california roll plus miso soup! Sure, they're kinda boring rolls, but for that price I couldn't pass them up! There are also other lunch specials where you can get a spicy tuna roll plus three nigiri!  Service was excellent and the sushi chef greets you as you enter!

Imagine this; A sushi bar that is adorned with a tasteful amount of Beatles swag on the walls. Off to a good start already. Saturdays are reserved for Beatles only music while the rest of the week you can hear anything from Aerosmith to Zepplin playing in the background. This place is a non-ayce place which causes you to be more thoughtful of your choices as to not have to take out a small loan in order to pay your bill since you're used to eating as much as you can stuff down your gullet at other places. Don't misunderstand me, this place is not expensive at all, we're just jaded a bit in this town with sushi prices based on the ayce model.   This place is refreshing! Small bar and dining that makes the quaintness of the place cozy as opposed to cramped. The Service is Superb! You feel as if you are a guest rather than a customer.  The quality is exactly what you'd hope to find at a REAL Sushi Bar. Top quality ingredients with great attention to detail not only with Chef Aki  mastering his craft but from the kitchen staff as well. Chef Aki's rolls are very artistically done with much pride and enthusiasm as you might be able to tell from photos (try the Hello Kitty Roll).  The bonus to this place is their daily lunch special. Each day of the week has a different Bento Box Special  priced at just $5. McDonald's across the way can't match that price.

Okay,  I understand you can't do it on a daily basis, but how's about checking out a Sushi joint that actually owned by a Japanese person, and has a Japanese sushi chef.     I came by this place by chance a few weeks ago, because I had to get a Pizza at  Papa John for my nephews, and this place located next door to them.    It's a small restaurant, and it was closed at that time because they take a short break between lunch and dinner; so I  put it on the back burner, and planned to come back.  Well, a few weeks later I finally checked them out.   There not much seats in this restaurant, and when I got there it was getting near closing time for them; so I got in without waiting.  I'm not much of sashimi person, so I ordered a Inari sushi  (3.00) for my appetizer, and I have to admit, it was very good.   Not too overpowering on the vinegar.    For my dinner, I ordered a Chicken teriyaki, Tempura, and Kara-age.   The teri Chicken was good, but the Kara-age was ono!      Wow....close to even my mom's recipe.      Service was fast,  maybe because I was the last person in for the night, but for under 20.00 with a tip, I was very surprised to have very good Japanese meal in Henderson.       It's not AYCE sushi, but who the heck can really eat that much rice without having a glucose tolerances issue.

After yesterday's lunch, I'm really looking forward to it.  After drooling over some of their food pictures, I decided to head there to try their famous Sunshine Roll. However, after looking at the menu, it would've been foolish to not take advantage of their lunch specials. Tuesday's $5.00 lunch was grilled mackerel & kara-age(bite-size fried chicken) including salad, rice, & miso soup. I settled for their 3-piece nigiri, tuna, salmon, & shrimp with California Roll. Accompanied with miso soup, also. $5.95. Great deal, I thought. Fish tasted fresh and yummy. I'm not sure if I looked at the kids menu, because they had a regular chicken teriyaki bowl special for $2.99. I ordered that for my son and we shared everything. Our bill = $9.56. Nice!   Moms of toddlers: it was ultra cute when the server brought my son an adorable kid's plate, that came with matching fork & spoon!  It's a small place with only about 5-7 tables and seats at the sushi bar. The staff  greeted us warmly and our food was served fast. Our server was very nice, I did notice she forgot my water. No big deal since I had brought a water bottle for my son. That is overlooked if my server is smiling.. and remembered my extra wasabi! Other thing that was noteworthy was she seemed hesitant when I asked them to substitute my shrimp nigiri for something else equivalent. They did...just was hesitant, it'd make me wonder if they are very open to substitutions. I'll see when I go back!  I glanced at their rolls and dinner combos. Rolls were priced about the same as other sushi joints, and dinner combos had a big variety to choose from.   I'll write an update after trying their Sunshine Roll my next visit.

I really enjoy Japanese food, and I must say that this one is rather authentic.  From the Japanese Sushi Chef to the lady helping, this is not a big business hiring a bunch of people to say  welcome  in Japanese, but the real deal.  The difference in the real deal compared to so many other places is that it is simple, not overpowering and you get the real flavors, not a bunch of flavors that are indistinguishable.  Appetizers - Had the Edamame, Kara-Age and the Gyoza, Simple salted Edamame that was very firm and easy to shell. The gyoza was very nice, not soggy or with sauce on it. You have to dip it in sauce if you want it. Chicken Kara-age is very simple, almost fried pieces of chicken. Yet, it is easy to be oily, or simply breaded. This one was very tender and the crispy batter was very light.  Main Dish -   California Rolls - Very nice.  Chicken Teriyaki - My daughter did not seem to like it so much as it had a lot of sauce, but I found the chicken to be very tender.  Combo 1- Chicken Teriyaki,Tempura,Kara-age - Son had this and it was ALL gone. Lots of food, had left overs.  Salmon Teriyaki - Perfect fish and the skin was crispy. I like it this way.  Sushi Combo 6 - Sushi,Sashimi,Kara-age - Love the simplicity of this dish.  Desserts - Did not try any.  Service - Very nice, pleasant. Very accommodating.  Prices - I did not see all you can eat, each sushi roll is about 12-13.00 and the set meals are all about 10-16.00.  Parking - Strip mall, very easy.  Seating - This place is small.

Too bad it doesn't taste as great as it looks.  -Spicy tuna roll topped with a white fish: never again will we order this.  The spicy tuna over powers all the other flavors, assuming that there are other flavors.  -Order of hamachi sushi:  Not the best piece of fish...

My friend has been urging me to try Sushi Imagine for a while now, and I finally agreed to eat lunch there with him today. Easily accessible in suburban Henderson just off the Valle Verde exit of 215, this small sushi restaurant is in the corner of the Smith's plaza about as far away as you can get from that grocery store.  There is a $5.00 dine-in only weekday lunch special that's different on each day. It's only available between 11:30am and 2:30pm. Tuesday's is grilled saba (mackerel) and kara-age. This particular one feels like such a steal, although the pictures of the others don't look too shabby either. They start you with a good miso soup that isn't too salty or watery, and then they bring out the bento box with rice, salad, a mushroom/seaweed mix, a couple small slices of orange, and the aforementioned proteins.  It is astonishing how much protein I got. The mackerel is a large chunk of moist, flaky fish that can go for around that price on its own at other places. The kara-age comes as five bite-sized chunks of juicy, flavorful chicken that can be dressed with the lime wedge. The rice is a balanced portion if you eat it with both proteins, and the veggies and fruits are fresh and tasty.  I will be back for Sushi Imagine's lunch specials sooner than later. I'm a little sad that I'm always busy on Fridays now because I probably won't be able to try the chicken curry for a while, but I'm sure the other specials will be as good if not better.", "Date": "2015-11-03", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ramsey", "ReviewID": "nLsZNZfVZRLAEpmFzH_z1Q", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Sushi Imagine is an absolute GEM in the Henderson area.

Coolies, it's located right off I-215 and Valle Verde so it's easy to get to. Why not. But I have to bring my 2 year old along so this complicates things a bit as he's picky. So we go and they are not open till 11:30. Ok, we go do something else for 30 min and come back and they're open. From the outside it looks like it's just another place in a strip mall. Step inside and you'll forget all about that.   You have two places to sit, right in front of the sushi bar, or at one of about 6 tables in the place. Service: Expectations totally exceeded. WOW! From the minute our wait person came over to our table until we left, she brought her A game. We had MANY questions and she answered them all. Kids plates, a sippy cup to contain any drink mess, and smiles all the way through. They didn't have a  kids menu  but she recommended several things and we went with Udon noodles. Smart choice. Once they cooled off he practically inhaled them, and was smiling. If he's happy, I'm happy. But it got better.   I ordered a lunch special with miso soup, Fried Aji & Kara-Age. Oh wow. I couldn't finish it all, not that I didn't try. There was nothing on that plate from the salad on down that I didn't enjoy. But the real treat was the sushi rolls. We ended up ordering a Rainbow Roll and a Dragon Roll. While the way they were presented at the table was nice, the ear to ear smile that my family member had was all that I needed to see.

It took me this long to mull over what rating to give this place.  It gets five stars by default.  Let me explain.  I guess I am a neanderthal, but I have never eaten sushi before.  Yup, it's true.  I was raised in the Midwest.  My family eats burgers and hot dogs and drinks sweet tea.  There isn't a sushi restaurant for several hours in any direction.  (Did I mention I didn't drive on a paved road until I was 18?  It's true.)  So, you must understand, trying sushi was a REEEAAALLL stretch for me.  In the interest of being culturally proficient, I solicited opinions about what to order from all my (more cosmopolitan) friends on Facebook.  List of suggestions in hand and fear in our heart, we walked into Sushi Imagine hoping to discover a new love.  Oh my sweet, sweet lord.  This did NOT go as well as planned.  I think we just don't like sushi.  In fact, we made total jerks of ourselves because we don't know how to use chopsticks.  I won't lie, we just went at our plates with our hands.  We tried the California roll, spider roll, and inari.  I will say, the inari was delicious.  It came out first and gave us a lot of hope that we might like the other things we ordered.  It was not to be.  We were wasabi-dunking fools - who knew that stuff was so darn spicy?  Not I!  I walked out with the clearest sinuses I have had in years.  And the sushi?  I don't get it.  I really don't.  I wanted to like it, oh yes, I did.  I guess I'm just a simple country bumpkin after all.  I gave this place five stars because the service was excellent, the presentation was gorgeous, and they were pretty gracious about us leaving out plates behind almost full, laughing as we paid and left.  I'm sure we were a sight to behold.  If you want good sushi, I'm sure this is the place.  I might go back and just order about ten orders of inari.  If you see a curly-haired woman with a plate full of inari, it's probably me.

It wasn't the largest meal but I wasn't super hungry so i ordered only two items. I had the spicy tuna roll and their specialty aloha ahi tuna delight... or some name like that I don't recall exactly. The spicy tuna was excellent, the best I've had in years. The rice comprising the rolls was not dry or old tasting and the meat was just perfect.   The ahi tuna roll was even more amazing. Each piece had a succulent slice of ahi tuna over it and man...the spiciness was right at my level. Every last bite was blissful-- I can't say enough wonderful things about this establishment. I would have ordered more rolls but my girlfriend wouldn't let me.   I can't wait to come back and try more items on the menu.

Different than your typical sushi place. The special cucumber roll that we had at other places was especially tasty with their pesto, spinach sauce, so good! Screaming O was also delicious, hubs said best he's tasted. Steak with mustard sauce also very good! It was like a mustard/wasabi/ginger something, whatever mustard mix it was, was really good with the steak. Also had the magic carpet which I thought with the kiwi might be too sweet but it wasn't. It was the perfect light appetizer.  The sunset roll also had that pesto sauce and sirracha mix that made it extra tasty!  Kids enjoyed spinning the wheel.

They're so good, super affordable, and are located within like three miles of two different places I've lived.  The other day in particular (Christmas Eve) I called up because my wife wanted some sushi and we thought we'd get some for her dad who was working all night. We called up and asked about several of the rolls. The girl up front knew exactly what was in pretty much all of the rolls offhand, and when she heard my wife (in the background) mention that she didn't like uncooked fish, she made sure to tell us that they could cook the salmon that was on top of one of the rolls. She also recommended their special (the Obla Di Obla Da Roll) when my wife mentioned what she likes in a roll and it was an amazing recommendation.  This wasn't my first visit, it won't be my last, and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "2016-12-27", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Rick", "ReviewID": "LR783H0NDCs7k8ph3yD5nA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Delicious, fresh and the most creative sushi around!", "Date": "2011-04-10", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jadey", "ReviewID": "8TzDoE5iMyL5y9AJSsRfNw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I feel like all I've been leaving lately is 5's, and that I'm being soft, and not critical enough.

This is not AYCE, but instead a journey of the palate interpreted through the story of the Beatles (the restaurant's namesake). Specialty rolls like Yellow Submarine, In My Life and P.S. I Love You are odes to top Beatles hits that include common sushi components enhanced by the craft of Chef Aki, who creates stunning art both on the roll itself and around the plate (see Sunrise Roll in the photo album) as his wife and family round out the remaining staff.  This is a family-owned business in every sense of the word. Customers pay homage to their amazing customer service and hospitality by providing various Beatle memorabilia, which is seen throughout the walls of the establishment. The memorabilia is only outmatched by the hundreds of photos of patrons lucky enough to win the grand prize from spinning the wheel. Yes, a chance to spin a wheel for every $30 you spend, and a photo of you with the $20 voucher (myself, the proud owner of two such photographs).  This is a great lunch spot, with traditional reduced price items, and generally good dinner specials as well, myself a fan of the Large Beer + free sake. The liquor selection isn't anything to write home about, if only because Many are too busy admiring the quality of the fish Aki uses.  I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the nigiri given the love shown for Aki's specialty rolls. Cuts of fish are generally thick, the fish/rice ratio (scientific term) is incredible for nigiri lovers, which I actually prefer to specialty rolls in general. Look for fish specials written in the white boards on the wall, or ask Aki yourself. The man has an amazing memory and can make you whatever you want, or anything you've had elsewhere, if he has everything he needs.   If you are tired of the quantity of good sushi you've consumed in Las Vegas' many good AYCE spots, try the quality of amazing sushi at Sushi Imagine. If,  All You Need is Love  you can't go wrong with this place.

Upon entering the sushi chefs and staff greeted us enthusiastically, as before. This is just one of those home-feeling joints where guests are always made to feel welcome. Our kudos to staff, thank you! Jalapeño bomb starter lived up to its name, bomb diggity! Husby had the miso soup, delicious though not extraordinary. Next, the highly-revered Hello Kitty--still our favorite. The Spider roll was delicious and the presentation gorgeous. However, we were disappointed to receive just 5 pieces rather than the 6 to 8 received in other rolls. The spider roll is one of the few soft shell crab items on the menu, and it is delicious. The Crazy Mexican--spicy tuna, jalapeño, cream cheese, avo, cilantro etc--had beautiful flavors, but we did not realize the tortilla wrapper until after receiving. We both agreed we would likely further  enjoy this combo w seaweed wrapper as opposed to tortilla. Husby was still hungry so we had shrimp and veg tempura, EXCELLENTLY done, and the dipping sauce flavorful. We had a coupon from our last wheel spin for a free large sake ($5.50 value) and it was very much appreciated.

No AYCE means I'm not stuffed when I go back to work, but it also can be trouble for me because my lack of discipline can lead to a $40-$50 lunch. It's hard to say no when I'm eating good sushi.   I order the lunch special #3 ($7.95) which consists of miso soup, 5 pieces of nigiri, and 4 pieces of california roll. That usually isn't enough for me so I'll order a roll or two more. Keep an eye on the dry erase board which has some additional delicious items not offered on the menu. The writing is small, so you might have to get up to look. On this visit I also ordered the A Little Help from My Friend (~$12?): cucumber, cream cheese, crab, topped with seared NY strip and mustard sauce. The roll was delicious.

Not wanting to limit ourselves to just the fish, we went with a combo that included a salad, some sushi, miso soup, tempura, and chicken karaage. We also added a roll and set forth to eat a modest dinner.  The soup arrived first. A fine bowl of miso. Then the platter with the chicken, sushi and tempura veggies. All were solid. I was a big fan of the chicken but you have to like karaage to enjoy the texture. It was served plenty hot and was definitely juicy. Tempura veggies were a light golden color and still crispy without being overdone. The extra roll came last and was generously portioned and a welcome addition to the mix.  Strip mall sushi spots are some of my faves--because they're so unassuming you can often have your expectations met. Such was the case for me. Simple dinner, then back to the hotel.
