I have never had more than a 5 minute wait from time of pulling into line, very important for when I am on lunch!  The staff has always been friendly and always responsive.  Although, evertime I go they have this generic message asking how my day is and I always respond like a tard- so to save yourself, dont worry about responding! :)", "Date": "2012-08-14", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ramsin", "ReviewID": "R7bsfJG1W5AUsw2rRmKJww", "Overall": "1", "Content": "the burgers are honestly on par with any and every other burger king i've eaten at. what i don't like specifically about this location that makes me give them 1 star is on 3 separate occasions in the past i was served re-fried fries. 1 of the times i saw them actually rescoop  my fries up from where they sit to get packaged and thrown back into the fryer so they would be warm... anyone that has had re-fried fries before knows exactly how they look and taste. disgusting and unacceptable.  Edit : these experiences i had were before they actually revamped and updated this location. i do not know if they still do practice this since then, nor do i plan to ever find out.", "Date": "2014-09-02", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Karla", "ReviewID": "Yye4VAmWDkZyh2aEPwjX7Q", "Overall": "1", "Content": "fuck this establishment, made me wait 45 minutes for my nasty ass food.

It is like every other BK around and is pretty consistent.  It gets the job done when you are in a rush and don't have time to cook.  I have to admit, I am here pretty regularly.  It is because:   1. I live around the corner and it is the closest place to my house. 2. It is cheap and has ok burgers and chicken sandwiches. 3. My kid loves the milkshakes and smoothies they have on the menu.  I love making her happy, so we visit pretty often. 4. The play place is pretty fun for the little ones.  It is especially nice when it is so hot in the summer.  It is nice and air conditioned, which us Las Vegans LOVE. 5. I may or may not be addicted to the new SatisFries.  This particular location has just gone through a remodel.  It is now more modern with a coffee house style to it.  The food is still the same, but it is now in a prettier locale.  So if you want a fast food joint, this one is pretty and pretty good at what they do.", "Date": "2013-11-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ms", "ReviewID": "YZZWLxmqVZXPbI-u_tfeiA", "Overall": "1", "Content": "CHICKEN KNUCKLES aka CHICKEN FINGERS are always burnt or cold. The first week advertised was the only time the order was right. The food always taste like it's sitting underneath a hot lamp. Their buffalo chicken tenders are never prepared the same way whenever you order. No continuity of service.

I just happened to drop in here because I had my daughter with me & I wanted her to play at their little indoor playground after we ate lunch (it was getting too hot outside to head to the park).   Anyway, I ordered the Angry Whopper combo meal because it looked delicious and it was. I just didn't end up finishing it because it was just too big for me. I guess my eyes were hungrier than my tummy. My daughter got their two chicken strip kids meal with the fries, and she loved it.   What really fascinated me about this place was they had that cool Coca-Cola touch-screen vending machine! That was definitely fun to play around with. There were soooo many choices too! I would go back there just to see what else they had!  Overall, clean establishment, nice staff. It's Burger King, so there wasn't really a  wow  factor this place other than it being, well.. A Burger King.", "Date": "2014-04-10", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Dana", "ReviewID": "A8sEOIo5lvIIenObr40kEg", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Every time I come to this location there's never been a time where they haven't ggotten my order wrong or gave me cold, old fries. Obviously I know that it is my fault to even come back here every time but it's the closest one to home. And j know every time when they give me regular Coke instead of Diet Coke... People know the difference... That's why they ask for the diet kind. Please please please have better service in the future!!!!", "Date": "2015-12-20", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "J", "ReviewID": "KXaV5tW1HgRRSvn-y5FSTw", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Having a 14 year old Son means a lot of trips to Fast Food joints and this one is in our neighborhood.  This one is not one of our favorite joints.  The food quality here is sub-par....even by fast food standards.  The Beef never tastes fresh and the Bread seems a little old at times.  We decided we wouldn't eat here anymore because it's that bad.  There are 1000's of other fast food joints to choose from.", "Date": "2010-12-15", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Sarah", "ReviewID": "RD6QyFZsSzK1QHRuKu3oZw", "Overall": "1", "Content": "I love Burger King but this location always messes up orders.

I was so surprised to see that they had brought the  Rodeo Cheeseburger  back! I have been still ordering it after all these years since the  Little Soldiers  gem disappeared from the menu I just had to customize a regular Cheeseburger to do so. It was cheap yummy!  The store was clean inside and I did use the restroom to wash my hands and it was clean too.

My son and I love coming here on a hot day after the library!! Here its a little hidden, but once you get here its super nice and air conditioned! We've been here a few times and each time its been pretty swell!   The wait is usually short bc its not always busy, the cashiers are pretty nice also, except one of the weirdos who told the manager she wasnt going to refill the ice in the machine.  The prices here are comparable, although I dont usually eat the burgers I do sometimes like the onion rings. What I really come here for, in addition to the kids meals, are the fruit smoothies and sundaes! The ice cream here is seriously sooooooooo yummy! And its only 1$ for a sundae! The mango smoothies are also super yummy and are 2$ and change!  My son loves the kids meals here, they include your entree but what he loves most is the paper crown attached.  They also usually have some pretty neat childrens toys.  So we will def continue coming here for the cheap eats, and nice cooled play area!", "Date": "2012-07-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Juju", "ReviewID": "dB3pFXnZNSZCVHvHZdQdxg", "Overall": "2", "Content": "This location can never get my order right. I asked for chicken fries and got chicken nuggets once. I didn't realize until I left.   I got cheetohs chicken fries and onion rings this time. I really couldn't tell if the cheetohs chicken fries sucked or if they messed up and gave me regular chicken fries. And I don't think their onion rings are actual onions. They taste like they use onion flavored batter.", "Date": "2016-11-02", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
