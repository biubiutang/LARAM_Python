Was also told to go as early as possible because it tends to sell out quick and when it's gone it's gone.  Given that today was Sunday, I do enjoy lamb, and it was pretty early a buddy and i figured we give it a shot.  The roast plate comes with a few slices of lamb, a giant yorkshore pudding, peas, carrots, some kind of sour vinegarie dipping sauce, a pat of butter,a piece of deep fried potato and an additional bowl of gravy.   The lamb itself wasnt very gamey tasting and had a present rosemary flavor to it. The slices themselves were fairly meaty with some fat for flavor. Gravy did an excellent job complementing the meat. Peas and carrots were your average canned sweet peas, the carrots were boiled down to the point where they were soft but mostly lost all their sweet carrotie goodness. The potato was interesting. Seemed they boiled it first then deep fried it to give it flavor and a crispy shell, potatoes are good... Yorkshore pudding wasnt exactly my favorite but who cares? We're here for lamb and we had some lamb.  Overall 10.95 is a bit pricey for the plate hence the three star instead of a four. If the slices were a bit thicker or maybe two more slices it would have been perfect and justifiable for the cost. In the end it was still a decent plate of lamb roast.", "Date": "2012-09-17", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Simone", "ReviewID": "Pn25iQ7GyuWThSkA1gMOgA", "Overall": "1", "Content": "We came here on a Saturday afternoon and the place had two other customers in it, but that didn't stop the bartender from being extremely loud everything she said she had to yell.

We also had the fish and chips, the fries were burnt, the fish was mostly just bland breading with a completely unflavorful piece of fish inside of it. I had to drown it with unflavored vinegar and salt before it was even considered edible.

I eagerly stumbled in on a cold, rainy night to imbibe in some traditional English brews, have some good pub food, watch some sports and try my hand at some video poker.  I should have stayed in the rain....  Service was fast and friendly but I was disappointed to learn that they only had an abridged menu for food.  My Smithwicks was a nice treat and made the shellacking I took on the video poker a little more palatable.   At least the beer would be free I reckoned, considering my 40 dollar donation I just gave to the machine.  I then decided on a bowl of clam chowder which was good in an unspectacular kind of way.  I watched some soccer they had on tv and then ordered a Harps as I needed something a little lighter.   So you're all thinking two stars....where's that coming from?  Well, let me tell you....I get my bill and both beers are on the tab.  For those of you that are not from Vegas, its a general rule of thumb that the bar takes care of at least one drink per 20 bucks played, more if there feeling generous.  I politely called this to my waitress attention and she said because I wasn't at the bar but at a side table with a machine, they charge.  I said that is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard but not wanting to cause a scene, I gave her my money and promptly left.    Considering there are hundreds of bars in town that wouldn't do a bush league thing like that, I have no need to ever go back there.  In fact, Im sure not even the main Crown & Anchor over on Trop would do that.  Im sure if I pressed the issue I could have had it resolved with a manager but the point is, I shouldn't have to do something like that.  Its akin to a restaurant charging for refills without saying they are and then you get the bill.  In today's society, complimentary soft drink  refills are standard so I shouldn't have to argue about that.  That's how I felt on this matter.  Im giving two stars because everything else was satisfactory and Im willing to give them a shot again down the road once my anger subsides...but if you must, do yourself a favor and head to the Tropicana location, you'll be a lot happier.", "Date": "2010-12-20", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "S", "ReviewID": "vkLmW_BsuTnWcmd0vElttA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Been coming here for years-  they even have a Sheffield United scarf hanging up in the pub!

I knew I was playing with fire since this location is on my way home from work and I could potentially wind up here more often than I would like.  But I guess luckily for me, the Little Anchor isn't as fun as its big brother.  It has a similar British/nautical theme as the original location, but it's not as dark and moody.  The bartenders are a little slower and the clientele a little clique-ier.  The bar was covered in food crumbs like it hadn't been cleaned in days.  We ordered onion rings and they were just awful.  I don't know how the breading managed to soak up 13 gallons of oil, but it did.  I took a bite and that was enough for me.

In Dallas we don't get many strollers and babies running around our bars.. but Vegas is a whole other ballgame.  Perhaps it is the Free Clinics form of birth control, let kids run amuck in the bars.  It was a cold, blistery evening (ok really this is in Vegas so it was more warm then anything) when I entered the Crown.  At first I thought they might be closed because the parking lot was bare.  We had gone in search for a place to watch the World Series as everywhere in the Casinos was either douching it out or showing College football (which normally I would be all about but the Rangers were in the World Series this time).  So after driving around a few places in search for a sports bar we settled on an English Pub.  They are bound to have TVs and sports right?  Yay I was right for once in my life.  We were quite literally the only people in the here and had the run of the place (it got more busy as the night went on).  They were great about changing TVs to what ever channel we wanted and turning up the volume.  This was the day before Halloween and the bartender lady was all decked out as a Slut cop (not a reflection on her I am sure she was a nice lady but that is what she was dressed up as).  She was great to look at and was nice but lacked in the service department.  I had to keep getting up and saying  umm.. Officer, can I get another beer?   Officer, can I have a dinner menu?   Officer is this blood on my shirt?   So basically I had to serve myself.. which my Mom told me would make me blind (good news apparently that is not true as I can still see!)  It was dark inside and the whole bar area was made up of video poker machines.  I found it odd when we ordered liquor we were told you could not order liquor at the bar and that we had to order food with it.  Weirdest liquor license ever.  Also I did notice several bugs cross our table which in a drinking pub no big deal.. but considering I was now eating here that became a huge turn off and it made it harder for me to serve myself... (do you see what I did there?  Turn off, hard to serve, myself.  no don't get it?  Ok you see by serving myself I am using visual parody to convey.. oh fuck it nevermind).  I had the fish and chips which comes with peas.  It was ah-ight.. I found it funny that the menu read..  same great fish now just more of it  ..  It was funny because I got one piece..

After I ordered my usual glass of wine, I noticed the Magner's Cider on the menu, and thought  Oh well, next time.     We had burgers and mine was superb - the meat was excellent, done just right, and the Stilton cheese was an unusual choice (I know, this is a British Pub, but you can't get it at MickeyD's, right?) that really made the burger taste special.  I was able to substitute a salad for the fries with no upcharge, and the salad was fresh romaine loaded with a ton of stuff.  My husband ordered the fish and chips - one piece of fish, but very big, and tons of fries, so I was glad I was able to get the salad, 'cause I helped him eat those very good steak fries.

It is especially a win if you're a soccer nut. That's not my thing, but I can appreciate that there is a place for them in a country that named our sport in which you throw a ball that can't touch the ground, football. There are free darts here as well, so that is pretty awesome.   One quirk I gotta get out of the way before I sing any more praise. They have an absurdly antiquated liquor license in which you can only drink beer at the bar. If you want the hard stuff you gotta feel like an outcast at the tables. Ok, so in a small place like this, perhaps outcast is a bit of an exaggeration. And they do have machines at some tables so you could still get your gamble on if that's your thing.   Now onto the positive stuff. The staff is always super friendly here. Bartenders always make me feel welcome, they are generous on comps, and the female bartenders are equipped with pretty awesome work attire. I'm pretty sure everyone loves school girl skirts, so that's a genius move on their part. They are genuine here too, we can BS about anything without the pretentious, keeping it proper type of conversation. I always appreciate genuine people. The food is also really good. I've had the burgers, which are not bad, but the chicken fingers are where they seem to shine. Nothing is outrageously priced, but including fries with their fingers would be a better choice in my book. The grilled chicken sandwich is pretty good too!

But then I drove by this place and remembered that there was something that I had to try on Mondays...  I found out after walking inside that Little Crown & Anchor Pub offers the same all you can eat fish and chips for $13.95 on Mondays (5pm thru midnight) as its big brother does. Having never tried this AYCE special before, I decided to take advantage of the opportunity.  The first plate that they brought out was huge. I'm actually not sure that I would've been able to handle it fully had I been in optimal eating shape. There was a huge pile of chips, a perhaps-too-generous helping of peas, the battered fish (of course), a lemon slice, and a dipping portion of tartar sauce.  I think the crispy batter was the best part of the meal, but the fish itself was slightly dry and fairly bland. Everything was on the bland side really, and no combination of condiments (salt, pepper, malt vinegar, tartar, even ketchup) truly helped the situation. The chips strongly resembled Red Robin's boring steak fries. They'll be happy to bring only fish as a continuation of your AYCE experience, but I ended up with taste buds dulled both by repetition and by some sense of feeling full. And flavor aside, I doubt that the fish filets are premium cuts given their nonchalant attitude toward providing seconds and toward wasted food.  I wouldn't really bother returning to Little Crown & Anchor Pub just for the fish & chips.

However the service left a little to be desired, they only had one waitress. I know it's a small place but damn. It wouldn't have been that bad, but we had uninvited guests at our table who would not leave us alone (gnats) and we wanted our check ASAP. The table next to us were discussing dining and dashing, because they were going through the same thing.  Overall this place wasn't too bad..

The server was quick to take my order.  I ordered an ice tea, onion rings appetizer, and the fish and chips of course.  The rings came out rather quickly and came with a side of ranch dressing.  Although they were lightly battered, they were literally dripping with oil, so much so there was a small pool of oil on the plate.  The fish and chips consisted of one medium sized piece of fish, thick cut fries, and a small bowl of peas.  The fish was above average, the breading was a touch on the heavy side.  The breading came off with a small amount of vinegar.  The tartar sauce was sweet, making it difficult to taste the relish or any other flavor.  The fries were nothing to write home about, looked overcooked and mushy and the peas were...peas.  The service was the worst part of dining here unfortunately.  Although our waitress was super cute (especially in her outfit) and nice, my ice tea took forever to be refilled and we usually had to request it.  When it came time to ask for the check, she gave us the check from the only other party in the pub.

We went in for the all you can eat fish and chips on Monday which sounds better than you feel after 3 reorders.  It wasn't overly greasy (except for the last 2) but the breading on the fish just lacked in flavor and the fish was frozen cod (not that I was expecting beer-battered halibut). So after downing a plate full of thick steak fries and getting a few reorders, I called it a day at 6 large pieces and requested the bill and walked out not entirely full but not wanting anymore...the quality is better than something out of the frozen section at the grocery store but less than I've had in any other restaurant. At 14.95 x 2 plus tax and tip, I could have had a better meal at 100 other places in town.

I'm not a huge beer drinker, so I usually stick to Boddingtons when I'm there, but the place looked to have a decent selection. I imagine less than the Trop location just based on the size of the place, but a nice selection none the less.   Since i did go on a sunday night, I imagine it wouldn't have been packed. but it was perfect for what we were going for. which was a few beers and their chicken curry. The portion was pretty hefty and easily shared between two people.

Literally, every time I stop in, some crazy sh*t happens to me. Pretty entertaining.  The first time I ever stopped in, I was supposed to be meeting up with my buddy Tien N. He totally stood me up, too....  LOL, actually, it was a miscommunication sort of thing, but I still tease him about standing me up that night. Anyway, as I sat there all glum and bummy (because none of my other friends wanted to hang out with me), I noticed something. There was a raffle going on. You could win hats, t-shirts, and what else?... BOOZE.  I had a ticket, but me being the unlucky person I am, I knew I wasn't going to win crap. This dude sat down next to me, and commented on me looking like a hipster, where I in turn, commented on him looking like some bum with a fake sports jersey on. Stunned by my snappy response, he apologized and offered up his name. Conversation died out, and soon he was munching on the food he had ordered.  The last raffle of the night, guess what? This dude wins!! He decided to take the bottle of Stoli. Then what does he do? Mutters,  Merry Christmas... , hands me the bottle, then promptly walks out. I was stunned. I guess he felt sorta bad..... By gads, it was a Christmas Miracle!!  Oh, and this older, semi-creepy gentleman was hitting on me, because I was there alone. Or maybe because it was simply because I had a vagina. Whatever the case, I explained to him about how I had been stood up, and he leans in and whispers ever so softly,  That guy is a damn fool if he's gonna miss out on a girl like you.  Cue in Berlin's  Take My Breath Away.   Funny thing is, he was there the next time, when both Tien N. and Anthony M. were both there, and I pointed, then yelled,  That's the dude that stood me up!!!  Tien was just like,  Huh?....  Good times.  The ambiance is good, and everyone is pretty laid back. Accept for the crazy jukebox guy. That dude plays the worst music, but he's so happy about it, you can't help but feel good about what's assaulting your ears at that moment.

To sum up our experience: when we got into the car, the first thing my husband said was  do you think I'll get sick from the chicken pot pie?   We headed here looking for a slice of British fare, ordering fish and chips, chicken/leek pie, and a side salad.  To start, the chicken pot pie was absymal. Albeit the pastry was a nice flaky crust, the filling was sour and unpleasant. I have no idea why it was sour. Hence, the question about my husband's intestinal health soon afterwards (he's fine but felt like he dodged a bullet). The uninspired mashed potatoes came with a generic gravy and frozen peas.  The fried fish was overbreaded, greasy and soggy on the bottom from either the moisture of the fish or the oil pool on the plate. The accompanying tartar sauce was too heavy on the mayo and lacked acidity to cut through the richness of the sauce. The chips were not crispy on the outside and were bleh.  The side salad was okay but the house vinegar/oil dressing had chunks of dried rosemary in it which made it unappetizing.  Finally, our waitress. We had to wave her several times to refill our drinks and she gave us the wrong check. I think she switched our check with the table next to us which is a bit mistake on her part (their check was 3x more than ours). I felt bad for her at the end of the day.  As someone who appreciates beer and British culture, I could see this place being fun to check out a football game or some great brews.
