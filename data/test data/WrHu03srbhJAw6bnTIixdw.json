There are other places in town I certainly prefer.   The ambiance is great. Very nicely decorated. Service is so-so. The waitstaff are all friendly but they could be more attentive. On multiple occasions I have had to flag someone down to get a drink refilled, and this was during lunch when it's rarely busy. Don't count on getting things in a specific order, despite asking to have certain selections come out first, things usually come out randomly.  The sushi is tasty, I particularly like the Screaming Orgasm. I have never had trouble finding plenty to order, but potential customers should be forewarned that not everything on the menu is available for AYCE.", "Date": "2010-06-29", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Yelp", "ReviewID": "tOqkOnfN2X4Fu5-cjx8j7g", "Overall": "4", "Content": "The $10 Lunchtime sushi special was a great deal and tasted great too.", "Date": "2016-10-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Marilou", "ReviewID": "XBsWQR1Wwj78npXlIIZd9Q", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Love this place.

If you like good service, this place isn't for you. If you want food outside of sushi,definitely not for you!  The sushi is very mediocre but the service is much worse. The rest of their food is nothing to write home about. The servers will give you plenty of attitude if you ask them questions about the menu and they frequently get orders wrong(tiny asian guy)....I've seen it. That's not to mention the long wait time. Something as simple as a glass of water may take 20 minutes to get, or be completely forgotten.My kitchen orders took almost an hour.When it finally came they gave us a burned skinny shrimp tempura,burned cheeseburger and the angel hair pasta that looks like a prison food taste was disgusting,.burned garlic,too sour,and the pasta was dry and was all over the plate mixed with the green powder stuff,what a hell of a wait for a crap food!  I'm not sure whether this place is just poorly managed, poorly staffed. Or both. I get the impression that they just don't care one way or the other if they satisfy their customers and it comes across in the service as well as the quality of the food. There are much better sushi places in sw that have great service and experience chef,don't waste your time here unless you're only interested in sushi and drinks at the bar.", "Date": "2012-03-24", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "LJ", "ReviewID": "WORNW47zFp8BXzIs4EuwYA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "It's All You Can Eat sushi people. You can literally eat all you can eat sushi until you blow or they cut you off.  I've been here a few times for lunch and they're very fast, even when their busy. I remember one of the times I did AYCE, our party of maybe 6-10 hungry people couldn't eat faster than they brought it out, it was weird cause most places it's the other way no complaints there. It was crazy, food kept coming out and we had no room on the table to put it. We ate as fast as we could and it seemed to multiply when we ate it haha. I loved it. The foods good, aren't all sushi  sushi grade  so they suppose to be good. If I closed my eyes and took a bit, the consistency and taste was all there so I'm a fan.  Let me see if I can remember my last visit. Picks my teeth. I had a spicy tuna roll, good and spicy I liked it. I had the Who's Your Daddy? roll, it was fish, cream cheese, and shrimp in a roll, deep fried, and topped with spicy eel sauce. I love deep fried sushi rolls. I had the Happy Ending roll, spicy soft shell crab in and out topped with avocado and spicy eel sauce. OK I lied I didn't remember this all from picking my teeth I'm reading off my receipt. Let me just list everything else it says.  *Bonzai Roll *XXX Roll *Crazy Jalapenos *Poki *Maguro (tuna) *Hamachi (yellowtail) *Hirame (halibut) *Garlic Tuna *Hotategai (scallops) *Amaebi (sweet shrimp) *Unagi *Uni (sea urchin) *Masago *Salmon *House Salad *Grilled shrimp salad *Pot Stickers *Shrimp tempura *Yakitori beef  I'm sure I had a lot more than this. Who's receipt is this!? Salad really? haha. I'm a fan of everything with or without screaming orgasm sauce, spicy eel sauce, tempura, fried, or baked, etc.  The interior is very nice and very spacious. They share the parking with various busy businesses so there might not be parking right in front or close by but park right behind Kobe, everyone forgets about the parking there. They don't offer a frequent diners card but there's little wait, friendly and fast service, and last I checked lunch AYCE was $22.99. There's also a Happy Hour 1/2 off rolls, 30% off sushi, and 2 for 1 alcohol after 5pm, don't remember what days though.", "Date": "2014-03-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Leslie", "ReviewID": "zhxZD4XQXSRWcE8TMlJOrg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "One of my favorite sushi place in Vegas--- I lied my only place I love to eat sushi!

And the real attraction to this place is their happy hour. Tons of rolls for half off. And some entree dishes as well.   The sushi is not top quality or anything like that just typical rolls like any other place.  The restaurant is quite big and lots of tables so you don't feel cramped like sushi mon.   The service is pretty good but they aren't super attentive.  Try the coco roll and their beef teriyaki both on the happy hour menu.", "Date": "2014-02-04", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Charlene", "ReviewID": "8thpknTPft0bEJfMySYUyw", "Overall": "3", "Content": "I have a love hate relationship with this place. I feel like it depends on the group of people I go with. Once I went with my boyfriend and instead of giving us any sushi that was on our order guide, they gave us all the a la carte items first and then started giving us one sushi order at a time slowly. I felt like they were trying to get us full fast on purpose.   I've also gone with a certain group of co-workers who are loud, obnoxious and fun to be around, and that's when I get the best service. I feel like the more livelier your group is, depending on your waitress, you get exceptional service so they can work a better tip out of you. Not only that, they've also given us extra plates of dessert  secretly  or let us  hide  food so we don't get charged.  There was also one time where we paid with credit cards, but we left a cash tip. Later to find out that they added a number to the tip line and charged us more tip for each person. Wtf.  And my last gripe is the plate size for these little portions of food. I love that when they bring out food, it is extremely fast. But the problem is, the plates are so large and unnecessary, it fills up the table completely way too fast and you have no room to work with.  The only thing this place has going for itself is the food. It's not the best I've eaten, but it's bearable compared to other places I've been to. I go here only with the certain group of co-workers on occasion and also because it is nearby where I live. This place is mediocre at best and so is the service.", "Date": "2013-09-15", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jane", "ReviewID": "y3a_SpFz5cSj9akQ3nk_ow", "Overall": "5", "Content": "For FRESH sushi in Vegas this is the place to go. They are having a promotion for All You Can Eat 23.99 dinner which is an incredible price for the variety of foods.

My recent visit discovery of the chicken plate I ordered tasted like rubber.    The sushi were ok. Nothing stands out compared to other around the area.  Their side portions like noodle soup are huge. I guess they want you to eat more sides than sushi.  There is no oyster or soft shell crabs. Service has improved and faster now.  This place has more mixture of family and hipster crowd.  Oyshi (or I called Trance Sushi since they always play trance music) has a more young hipster vibe.  there's never a line since the place is big.", "Date": "2014-09-26", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Din", "ReviewID": "VFfJhCaEt6SHXhWq3NRkSA", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Feel bad for this place actually.  The food has been consistently good, and my better half has enjoyed the Salmon entree many times.  That being said, came here on an evening with a friend who enjoys AYCE.  My wife and I rarely ever eat more than a roll or two, and we've never been big on the all you can eat thing.    Now, due to this restaurant having a party of 11  kids  show up at some point the previous week, and four ordering AYCE and sharing with the table, I am not sure how this translates to every other customers problem, or why someone didn't cut that party off sooner. Kobe has implemented some new policies, and management have decided that either everyone at the table orders all you can eat, or every one orders a la' carte, regardless of wanting sushi or entree dishes.  Even worse, they don't tell you this until you sit down and get comfy.  I felt for our server, who was trying his best, but when you have a place that is this careless in the first place, what can really be said about the rest of the operation?  Again, it's too bad really. We've been here several times before this, and have spent an average of $70-$80 w/tip for two people, including drinks (and NOT AYCE).  Because of one BAD service experience, we won't be going back, ever.  A lot of things are forgivable when going to a restaurant, poor service is not one of them though.   And, yes, we did go to another Sushi establishment this evening (Sushi Koma), ordered what we wanted, and spent some good coin in doing so, and it was still a fun and great evening, thanks in no part to this restaurant however.  2 stars for the server trying the best to make a sticky situation work out.", "Date": "2016-01-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Amy", "ReviewID": "n8Uu-a3dQ1_xqBhVda4gHA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I found the service here amazing as well as the food.
