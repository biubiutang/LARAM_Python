We were seated right away and service was decent.  The prices are a little high for breakfast, but it is after all Vegas and the portions were pretty good.  I had the peanut butter and banana stuffed french toast and it was very yummy!  It was super super rich though, and I really had to push myself to finish the entire thing.  The belgian waffle was pretty plain and boring, and the corn beef hash was decent.  The best deal is their (i forget what it's called) eggs, pancake, ham, bacon, sausage, potatoes combo plate.  The portion was very generous and the ham was delicious!!  $14 may seem a bit steep for breakfast, but you do get what you pay for.  I don't think I would go back again, considering there are so many other options in Vegas.

The overall quality of the food is fine and if your on your way back to your room after a night of gambling fun its an ok alternative. If you have time go somewhere else.

If you're staying at Caesars Palace, it's always open and even during slow times, the Cafe still gets moderate traffic.  The problem with ol' Augustus is that I have never had a great time with him.  He's comfortable, that much is true, because I know him well.  They serve pretty much your standard American fare with a few random outliers (most of which are Italian).  Augustus is really no fun.  Be willing to wait in line here.  I had the Caesars VIP pass that let me cut in front of all the sad folks who have been standing in line for a good 45 minutes.  I truly did feel bad for these people but, hey, Augustus and I go way back.  The service here is fair at best.  It gets insanely busy in the restaurant.  I'm not looking to constantly hold hands with the server but throw me a bone here.  At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.  The only redeeming factor is that Augustus is there for you when you need him and he's surprisingly dapper in the morning.  I will say that the one thing that Augustus does well is breakfast.  If you can beat the breakfast rush, they have some pretty high-quality items going on.  If you've got another option, take it, otherwise prepare for a meal version of watching the Lord of the Rings trilogy.", "Date": "2009-08-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Amanda", "ReviewID": "HxEuUYeLVlAcVFN2LaUObw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Okay, so we ate here the first time mostly due to its close proximity to our room and our extreme need for nourishment. They are open 24 hours and their menu is pretty extensive for such a little place. We never waited in line and the hostesses were friendly. The wait staff was a little spotty and the same person never came back to our table until it was time to bring us the check. It was hard to know how to tip for that, but we were so full by the time we left that we hardly cared at that point.   We ate at Augustus once for breakfast and once for lunch. I can honestly say that both times it was wonderful. For breakfast, I had a Belgian waffle (complete with Caesar's Palace stamped in the middle!) and hash browns. Typical morning after drinking fare. The waffle was fluffy and the hash browns were just salty and greasy enough to hit the spot.   For lunch, I had a chicken Caesar salad and was not disappointed. The bright star of this meal was the side of fries I got. Delish!   So, we were happy with this little cafe being so near our room's tower. We basically fell out of the elevator and stumbled in here.

My goodness! For $58, you would expect a decent meal. (April, 2011) I ordered the chicken sandwich with potato salad and my husband had the Cuban with black beans. Nothing fancy, nothing hard to cook, just good solid food after a day of walking the strip.  Honestly, this was absolutely the WORST chicken sandwich I've ever had. It was dry, overcooked and had alfalfa (not sprouts) on it, which was bitter and revolting. (I never start taking apart sandwiches to pick things off of them but I couldn't tolerate this and took the green stems off.) I love chicken sandwiches but this thing just did not fit the bill. It also had avocado on it - which I love, but they'd failed to add even a touch of salt to them so they were tasteless. And, I should probably mention there wasn't a spec of any kind of sauce on the sandwich - no mayo, no mustard , no salad dressing, no honey mustard, nothing! Which added to the overcooked dry meat effect. It was awful. The potato salad was made with real mayo (nice touch) but was greasy and had a weird texture. Made me wonder how long it'd been unrefrigerated. Didn't finish it either.  My husband was non-plussed with his sandwich too. He simply said that  we can make better at home . And he didn't eat much of his beans which looked gross - of course black beans aren't the most appetizing bean on earth served all soupy in a white cup. Oh well.  We could have had a better, more satisfying meal if we'd gone to McDonalds... That being said, the service was fine, although being what Caesar's Palace is, we felt a touch underclass dining here. It was at the end of a long day and we were tired and looking forward to a good meal. We felt really screwed by the end of this dining experience.

The sandwich was enormous and stuffed with really good turkey, perfectly ripened avocado, and crispy bacon. The pile o' french fries were really good! Shoestring, crispy on the outside.

The first time, we were sitting in a group of 14. The waiter did not split the bill (don't know why they can't). I mean, it's not like we all sat together at the table at the same time; people were trickling in so it's not like he had to take all 14 orders at once.   The service was really slow and since there's 14 of us, they tacked on the auto 18% gratuity even though we only saw the waiter...maybe once until it's time to pay...(he took the orders and different waiters brought the food in increments). That was not cool at all but I guess that's how they roll. Whatever.   The second time, service was okay. Our waitress was really nice but there was practically no other patrons at the restaurant so I didn't get why our food was taking so long. My brothers and I were joking about how they're busy baking our cheesecake and creme brulee at the back.   Anyway, 3 Stars because I like the food. I highly recommend the cheesecake (bang for your buck, it's freaking huge!) over creme brulee because I had better creme brulee from somewhere else.", "Date": "2010-08-18", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Gabby", "ReviewID": "Y5Msvs6eAKB5fhfUOrPrHQ", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Apparently yelp does not let you rate with negative stars like this place deserves. This is the WORST place to eat in Vegas EVER! My friends and I came here for a late breakfast and were sadly disappointed at the breakfast selection at 1pm on Sunday, this is Vegas after all. My friend and I ordered the make your own omelet and not only did they mess up the order once, but twice. Not a complicated order either. And to top it off it took darn near 45mins to get the food. The waiter gave us free bread to make up for screwing up our order... maybe that is compilation to some... Needless to say this place is a waste of time and to top it off its VERY expensive for food one step above Denny's. At least Denny's gets my order right and HOT!", "Date": "2011-02-22", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Monica", "ReviewID": "zGPJs_-gN-rQG4HYPD7cfw", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Two stars for decent food (not bad by any means) plus a half star for the bread basket and another half for our sweet waitress  First off, you shouldn't expect to eat in any casino restaurant (and I'm not talking about a place you could call a joint/diner/cafe) without overpaying for what you get.  Augustus in Caesar's is no exception and you're looking at $15 burgers, $11 quesidillas, $9 cups of soup, and $20+ if you want an actual entree.    Hell, you dont even get a free basket of bread if you order anything that can be construed as a lunch item (appetizers, salads, soups, sandwiches, burgers).  That is, unless your waitress is sweet enough to bring you one on the sly.  We understood why it was such a big deal only after we devoured our zucchini bread muffins and egg&bacon breakfast rolls.  Nothing could have been more soothing for our hangovers than the essence of breakfast captured by our single bread basket.    Like everyone else has said, the food is agreeably mediocre, though it makes for a safe and solid choice when you cant stand to have one more bad meal.", "Date": "2007-07-02", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Sarah", "ReviewID": "NAIYNyKnmOrXibVfTgRtRg", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Food  located near the entrance of Cesar's Palace, breakfast, sandwiches, salads, burgers, entries, shakes, smoothies, moderately priced, quick service, hearty portions", "Date": "2010-09-05", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Leslie", "ReviewID": "GlaxB_wSujdKCAkAUo3MHQ", "Overall": "3", "Content": "The line for lunch and other busy hours is looooong, but you get to cut everyone if you're diamond club.
