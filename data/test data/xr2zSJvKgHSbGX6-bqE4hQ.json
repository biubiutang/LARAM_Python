A drug store. Closed that early on a Friday night? For god's sake, many Walgreens are 24 hours!  Whoever runs this store - drugstores exist to serve people when it's convenient for THEM, but when it's convenient for YOU. If you don't want to stay open on Friday nights, you're in the wrong line of work.", "Date": "2011-02-22", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Greg", "ReviewID": "8Wfz37u2qw4mzGlcDhidLA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "OK, I have to say I zipped into this place only for about 10 minutes.  I give it a four overall.  a.  Hawaiian Section - OK, this is the 5 star point. They have a small section for hawaiian product, snacks and some ingredients.  If you are a fun of hawaiian snacks, this is great and they have a decent selection.  b.  Service - 4 start - Not bad, the line was not long, and when there were more than a few people, another cashier showed up to reduce waiting. I thought that this was great.  c.  Location - 4 star - Inside a mall is a bit busy.  All the lights to turn into Galleria Mall take like forever to turn green.  Parking is a bit  busy  as there are plenty of other places near to this Walgreens.  d.  Go Back Factor - It is a bit more difficult to get to this one, however, I will be returning for the Hawaiian food as it is great to load up on snacks.  GK says, if you are in the area, try it out.  Otherwise, getting there is a bit of a pain.  If you have a hunkering for Red Nori Iso Nuts, or Le Hing Mui, or Arare crackers, this is the place to go.  Check it out!", "Date": "2013-09-24", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Richard", "ReviewID": "EarTMKKHBsgLSv2rMRwD-Q", "Overall": "5", "Content": "FUCK N AMAZIN  Customer service? CHECK. Shit you need? DOUBLE. BUBBLE. CHECK.  Now if you were coming to this Walgreens and expecting it to transform into Optimus Prime and take you to one of Saturn's glorious moons... You are in for a surprise.... because it's a fuckin walgreens.   Now... If you came to a Walgreens... expecting to be at a Walgreens. It has GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE and the shit you know is at walgreens. You can't come to Walgreens and get pissed that it wasn't secretly a Walmart inside with a gaming section and full grocery store.   All this being said. I'm gonna punch this Walgreens in the face with 5 stars.   Thank you.", "Date": "2013-10-26", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Michelle", "ReviewID": "i1qOIYTWqoPbvKcZuax3TA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I go to this Walgreens all the time. I saw what the girl wrote about the one manager. He is no longer there. This store is always clean and the people have been extremely helpful especially when I'm trying to get specific sized photos made. Justin in particular has been very helpful. I've also seen him go out of his way to help other customers. It's true the hours are not 24 hours. If you need something in the middle of the night go to a convenience store or Walmart. But this store has been amazing each and every time I've gone.", "Date": "2015-03-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Paul", "ReviewID": "2SmbVjFuisPD63fgv00emw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I like this location because it is pretty slow I mean I do see people in there, but very few. The manager is very nice and helpful. There is always parking. The lines are always short here and there is almost never a wait.

It's never too crowded and the customers aren't too sketchy (as with the store up on Flamingo and Boulder) - Anyways, the clerks are always helpful.. The cosmeticians are always sweet and understanding. The pharmacy was always accurate with my prescriptions.   Now I work there and I enjoy it. Cary the Pharmacy Manager is really efficient and pleasant to talk to.  He is very knowledgeable and remembers faces really well. Great experiences here!", "Date": "2013-01-08", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Rick", "ReviewID": "a5eyDVdcBgxaMNGPww_nOw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Shorter hours than the rest in this area bit there is almost never a wait of line.
