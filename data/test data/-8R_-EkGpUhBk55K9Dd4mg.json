I ordered the Yellow Curry and my boyfriend ordered the Pad Thai. She asked us how spicy on a scale of 1-5 how spicy we wanted our food and they were spot on. The Yellow Curry was delicious I loved the addition of coconut milk. The Pad Thai was excellent as well. The food is super healthy. The prices are very low, and the service was awesome. Check this place out for sure!", "Date": "2013-11-18", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jessie", "ReviewID": "0hclY2GztJE7g2-FIvn4FQ", "Overall": "3", "Content": "I work up the street from Sin City Thai, so when it opened up I was excited to have another potential lunch spot. I finally got around to trying them for lunch on Valentine's Day with the lovely Jaime W. as my dining date.   We started out with delicious hibiscus lemonades. Very refreshing, definitely something I would try again. We also shared a chicken satay appetizer. It was good, but not great.  For my meal, I went with the Mixed Vegetable lunch special which is a good deal at $6.95. The menu does not give a description of the dish, I assumed I would get an assortment of veggies like corn, mushrooms and broccoli. Instead I got onions and peppers in assorted colors. I was rather disappointed by this.   I decided to go back and get some takeout before posting a review. This time I went with the Orange Chicken lunch special. I did not call in my order, but they still had me on my way in about 15 minutes. I liked this dish better then the Mixed Vegetable dish, but it still didn't blow me away and I doubt I'd order it again.   Service each time was efficient and friendly, and since I work really close I will probably go back at some point to try the Pad Thai. Hopefully after that I can update and add another star but until then, Sin City Thai is just alright to me, nothing special.", "Date": "2013-02-27", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Orion", "ReviewID": "xeIIAkwyTXkp6Q0617-AnA", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Came here for lunch during work.  The food was pretty good I suppose but I haven't yet been to a lot of Thai restaurants so I don't have many places to compare it to.  One thing that I have to note though is that the  Yellow Curry w/ Chicken  (lunch special) had a small strand of hair on the spoon which I had to send back.  But they quickly took it back and brought me a new bowl as soon as I mentioned it to them.  If it wasn't for my friends I probably would have just left, but I was being a team player.", "Date": "2013-12-04", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Debbie", "ReviewID": "3KZ2DNn8TMylkHraWVi23A", "Overall": "2", "Content": "We actually tried to go to Berlin Cafe but it is closed on Saturday for lunch. Since I was hangry, i just needed to eat and this was next door.   The space reminds me of a diner with seating and an open kitchen. The seating area was decorated minimally with some wall decor and small fake floral pieces on the table.   The server was friendly and nice. A little young and needs to learn the service process more, as our table did not have enough silverware and she never came back to check on us  We ordered:  Silver Noodle Salad -  this was a 3 out of 5 in spice level and out was out of control hot for a  medium .  In terms of flavor, I couldn't taste it because my mouth was burning.   Mongolian Chicken - not Chinese style but good flavors  Pad See Eww - it was ok, nothing special.   I would not come back.", "Date": "2014-01-01", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "AllYson", "ReviewID": "wMInPu_BxaammGB68LDojw", "Overall": "2", "Content": "So my office eats here quite often because its pretty close and we only have 30mins. Never had issues before but this past time was just terrible.  Ordered 2 lunch specials, 1 reg chicken entree, order of egg rolls and 1 sticky rice.  Got there to pick up and wanted to add on an extra sticky rice but they said they were out. OK.. no big deal. Got back to the office and realized I didn't even get my 1 order of sticky rice one of the lunch specials had onions (requested to leave them out) and only 2 packets of soy sauce. Called and told them we'd come back for a new order w/out onions. The office assistant went back and got the new order, asked for extra soy sauce and asked for the sticky rice we didn't get. The bigger guy said he put it in the bag himself so he knows we got it.  She got back to the office w/the new order.. it was sooooo spicy, maybe I was being punished for complaining they got my order wrong. They gave 2 more packets of soy sauce (like really?). And when she told me about the man telling her about the sticky rice I was so annoyed I called.. Talked to him and after arguing for 5 mins he said  now that I think about it I might have given it to someone else.. We got really busy.   Why would I lie about a $2 side of sticky rice, come on?! Very rude. Service was horrible. And food was just OK.", "Date": "2014-11-11", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ashley", "ReviewID": "RP1BIAwCrsGmfjqS7_cmIA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Sin City Thai was amazing!

I called in and the girl was quick to take and repeat my order:  1. beef salad - surprising amount of beef! but needs more lettuce and juice/sauce. i love any beef salad, this was middle of the road good flavor wise. the beef on it though was better than average because it was cooked well, wasn't chewy, and there was a ton of it. 2. beef pad see ew - not bad, not great, just averagely good.  i wish there was more broccoli in it.  3. green curry - i debated between yellow and green and the waitress said  our yellow curry is more popular but i like the green curry flavor more . so i went with the green curry with chicken. it comes with white rice, and is the greenest green curry I've ever seen. almost a lime green. the color threw me off but the curry itself was good. Good consistency, packed with veggies and thin (maybe too thin) slices of chicken. I told them  mild spicy  and it was on the tame side. i'll try this again next time but with  medium spicy   10% off if you pay cash! (which I didn't have) .... my total came out to $30.11", "Date": "2013-10-24", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Terry", "ReviewID": "ELbc9ci-wUMpf7TUYi8ctw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "We order the pad kea mow spicy level 3, papaya salad spicy level 3 and a side of sticky rice.

The restraunt it's self is pretty small,  only about 8 tables.   When I arrived in was still kinda crowded from the lunch rush,  and none of the tables looked bused yet.  The gentlemen in the front serving noticed me right away and cleaned off a table promptly.   I ordered a plate of pad kea mow,  which is my favorite Thai dish.  I got my food quickly in less than ten minutes.  One thing I thought was strange was how the noodles used were not fat wide noodles that I usually see in the dish.  Instead they were similar to fettuccine noodles.  When asking how spicy I would like,  the waitress asked between one and five stars.  Now,  I'm used to them asking me in between one and ten,  so it took me a second to decide on my desired spiciness.   I went ahead and went with a two.   The dish it's self was still pretty spicy, and it was lacking some of the essential flavors I was looking for.   All and all,  it was a nice cheap and quick place for me to spend my lunch,  and I will probably be coming here again.", "Date": "2014-09-29", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ryan", "ReviewID": "nx1x9j_X64TLS6Fhj5VElg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "First time I got food from here I ordered Chicken Fried rice and Crab ragoons. Rice was awesome. Ragoons were a little too sweet for my taste so I wasn't feeling them. Went back like a week later during my lunch time but this time I only had the fried rice it was just as awesome as the first time. Definitely recommend it. There's not many places in this area to eat if you work around here, this is a good place to consider. It's cheap and they only charge 2 bucks for delivery I believe. Portions are great too. Fried rice I ordered was enough to feed 2 of us.", "Date": "2016-02-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "LJ", "ReviewID": "pFwGsuEz8-WyR8K9sC23eA", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Came here for lunch and it was packed. Usually a good thing. They have a nice looking lunch menu for $6.95 which includes an egg roll, won ton, soup, rice, and choice of curry, pad thai, beef broccoli, and few more. Warning they use a 5 levels heat scale for their curries just incase you order a 5 thinking its medium, most places I've been to use 10 levels. Customer service was great. The interior was nice and clean. Sounds like I should be having a good experience.   Unfortunately when it came to the food, the one and only time I think I'll ever be here, it was pretty bad. Yea I ate the whole meal but it was a struggle and I was hungry. I went with the yellow curry with chicken from the lunch menu. It was pretty runny to what I usually  have at other places. The chicken seemed over cooked and some of the veggies were partially raw. The flavor wasn't as strong also. After the first couple spoons I was like I don't want anymore. Started to add rice maybe I would get better nope. Anyways I ate it all feeling very unsatisfied. Would I be back? Maybe, I should really give them another chance but not rushing it.", "Date": "2015-09-10", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Sabrina", "ReviewID": "awQv6i_X-0sTUmf0dtz0vQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Edit: I had to drop one star.  Their consistency has gone down.  Their curries used to be sooooo good but the last time I got it it was soupy and liquidy. Not like their normal items at all.  Same with their Pad Thai. Disappointed.  :-(      I am picky when it comes to Thai food and this place was surprisingly good.  The pricing was cheaper then archi's and the decor was definitely not there but the green curry was great.  The pad kee mow was a little disappointing but the owner told me that it was not gonna be the same since they had run out of the large flat noodles. And i agree it was not the same but it was still decent.  The Thai tea was ok...I still think archi's is better... but I saw the thai coffee as I was leaving and it looked good.  I will definitely be going back to try the other dishes I have not tried and a another huge plus... they deliver!", "Date": "2013-03-29", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
