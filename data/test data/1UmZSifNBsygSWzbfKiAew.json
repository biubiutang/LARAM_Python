It is tucked in a shopping complex. The place is not too small and quite cozy. The decor is simple yet still showcases an Italian atmosphere.   We are welcomed by our lady host who is both friendly and seem to sincerely enjoy her job. Customer Service is very very important to me and she pass with flying colors! I myself cook so-so Italian food so I can pretty much figure out their recipe, but at least I can say trying a parmesan alfredo cream-sauce pizza for the first time, I must say, it is quite a difference taste (I will surely try to make my pizza this way). My husband definitely liked their 18  specialty pizza alfredo for $18 + add'l chicken for $3.50 and it is good. The  size  is awesome with the thin crust perfectly done (not burned, which is key). You may fold the slice ala-NewYorker style. The bacon bits thought initially as too sparse, but the taste is just right, however, I still would've liked it just a little bit more in there for the price you're paying. The chicken I paid extra is nicely sliced, so can't complain there.  We did have calamari fritti for appetizer, and it is nothing extraordinary from others I've tasted before, it is good but the only thing is, it is a smaller serving than I am used to, so for $9 it is a bit expensive for its size. However, it is a local business and understandably its usual higher pricing. The garlic knots could be a bit bigger, but its taste is also alright. We had the Penne Alfredo, plain in presentation but the taste makes up for it.  It has the crumbled italian sausage which is quite tasty.   Groupon did suggest the Shrimp Parmigiana Sub sandwich, and although our order brought to our table was incorrect, the hostess graciously acknowledged and had the right one prepared (no big deal). The breaded shrimp is smaller than I expected but with the marinara sauce, and having devoured the pizza + pasta, I just can't seem to taste the sub separately. Since we were stuffed and took home most of the sub sandwich, I can perhaps taste this next day to really appreciate the taste and judge it accordingly.  I did give it 3 stars of 5 only because it is very similar taste to many Italian Restaurants I've been to, but it doesn't mean it is not good. The food is good overall and quite friendly staff, but at this economy and tight business competition, one should really have to invest in great customer service really if they want to survive and stay around awhile. I do not mind coming back and try their stromboli since I read it is quite good! I wanted to order it but my husband wanted the shrimp sub instead.  However, having said that, it is a tough economy and I'd rather come back with yet another (discounted) Groupon rather than paying full price, but then again, boosting the local business should not hinder me either.  Observing customers this evening, I see a couple or so families. A couple more coming in to order to go, and seem to be a place you just want to eat at cz it ain't crowded and perhaps more of - let's skip cooking tonight and have some pasta night kind-of place.  So, I do recommend this place! It ain't gourmet by all means but a simple and quaint place to go to with alright italian/pasta and good service.", "Date": "2012-04-26", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Shokouh", "ReviewID": "TnC6RLfxS04g7SnYHTMtOQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I bought a Groupon deal online and based on my first impression and the amazing Stromboli we had I'm giving this restaurant 5 stars.   I cannot judge any of their other menu items since I only ordered a Stromboli but let me start with the service.   Upon entrance we were greeted by a little girl. She was so sweet and she took us to our seats and took our order of two waters. This little girl was so polite and professional. She was a way better waitress than so many others we have had.   Then some other lady took over and took our orders of food. She was also very friendly and when I asked if I could substitute something, she went and talked to the cook to make sure it was possible.   She also brought us house made bruschetta which was delicious (any restaurant with any type of appetizer on the house scores for me automatically).  I ordered the cheese Stromboli with ham and mushrooms. I admit,  I was a little nervous that it would be too small considering that it was at about $6.99 the cheapest entree type of food on their menu.   When our food came out I was positively surprised and stunned. The portions were big and it looked absolutely delicious. The Stromboli had fresh minced garlic all over it and the whole thing was full of flavor.   This first visit raised my appetite to go back and try more of their menu items.

The pasta tasted like a can of chopped tomatoes dumped on some spaghetti with no seasoning. The eggplant Parmesan was heavily coated in thick breading that took away the flavor of the eggplant. The calamari was mussy and had no flavor. I went into the restaurant for a eggplant sandwich  and was asked if I would prefer the eggplant on the side with pasta. It sounded good.  To my surprise when the check came I had ordered a dinner portion and was charged $11.75 compared to my $6.95 sandwich.  I was not able to finish my dinner portion and due to the eggplant was so bad I had no desire to take it home.  My lunch came to a total of $32.95.  My stomach was upset the rest of the afternoon due to feeling like I was taken, and the rich food.  They have lost my business and I will share my experience with friends and  neighbors.  I give you less than 6 months of being in business with the food you are serving and your customer service.", "Date": "2011-11-11", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Robert", "ReviewID": "LH4uWbG1iXk8hrKmxjOxdg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Server was quite friendly and food was tasty.

I seriously don't know what the other reviewers were complaining about.  We ordered pizza, garlic knots, subs and chicken francese.  EVERYTHING was wonderful!!  My chicken tasted outstanding, although I would have preferred a little more chicken for the $13+ paid, however it was yummy!  The bread for the subs was fresh and the sauce is perfect!  I hate overly spiced sauces where your mouth is on fire.  This was tasty.  The chicken parm on our sub was mainly chicken, not breading and before eating here I would never consider ordering a meatball sub.  This place changed my mind.  The meat was tender and seasoned just right.  My in-laws ordered a ham pizza and I like that the crust is thin.  It was very good and not as expensive as another back east pizza place just up the road.  And the bruschetta served with bread (complimentary) prior to our meal was a perfect addition.  Great service and outstanding food!

We were a little surprised with the prices but decided to give it a try. Wishing for the best, since there isn't that many restaurants on this side of town. So we ordered the spaghetti and meatballs to split. Sauce was ok, tasted like something I could of made from the can with a few added herbs from my pantry. The meatballs I do have to say were really good. Oh and the portions was big enough to split.  Also it was nice to have the owner come out and greet us to see how our dinner was. I'm hopping this place stays around for a bit. I'd like to come back and try something different.

In the past I've had their pizzas, which taste great. However, yesterday I decided to try their chicken Marsala. It was only 5 small strips of chicken with the sauce and a few mushrooms with spaghetti on the side for $12. For the lack of taste in the chicken and the small amount, I felt ripped off. My friend ordered the Brooklyn Calzone and it tasted great. The service was great. We had refills of our drinks and you have the option of choosing iceberg or romaine lettuce for your salad. I must say, the cannoli here tastes awesome. Just avoid the chicken Marsala here.", "Date": "2012-07-21", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Greg", "ReviewID": "N3I62LnsKvrbAS6r4mJOqg", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Ok I love Pizza.

We were greeted right away by a friendly server who made us a table for 6. Atmosphere was very nice, Sinatra playing in the background. There are several signs throughout the restaurant that have sayings about family which help to really emphasize this place is a family-friendly restaurant. The menu had a nice variety of pastas, Stromboli, calzones. The server brought out delicious, soft bread with butter on the side and a side of bruschetta. Very tasty!   I ordered the angel hair pasta with shrimp, broccoli, garlic and olive oil. The pasta, shrimp and broccoli were cooked perfectly, but the overall dish needed a bit more flavor, nothing a little more salt or red pepper flakes couldn't fix. My son loved his spaghetti and meatballs. And my older son had baked spaghetti which he devoured as he proclaimed he liked this place. The hubby ordered the rigatoni bolognese and though I didn't taste it, he said he enjoyed the dish and that the pasta was cooked al dente just as he liked it. My father ordered some side sausages which were excellent!! I'm normally not fond of sausage but after hearing my husband and father talk about how great they tasted, I tried it. It was flavored perfectly. The spices that went into it were just right as was the texture.   Lastly, we ordered a large pepperoni pizza which required the waitresses to bring over another small table just to hold it! The pizza was good, right amount of cheese, nice crust. My husband is always on the lookout for great pizza and he really liked this.  The people were wonderful! The owner came out from behind the kitchen and went to each table to ask how the meals were. Very friendly, very personable...even joked around with us! We found out it is his daughter that sometimes greets people at the door and seats them. How cute is that? Our waitress was excellent also. She was very friendly and was on top of her service.   Overall, I really enjoyed Spaghetti & Co. The family atmosphere, friendly and cajoling staff, and the food made us feel as if we were eating dinner at our Nonna's house (if we had one)! We will definitely be back!

If you're looking for the Americanized version of Italian food, it's best if you just go to the Olive Garden or Denny's. This place has the real deal authentic Italian. Their Ala Vacca sauce and Carbonara is amazing. The only place I've had better is in NYC.  As far as the bad reviews I've read, I can't find anything about the place to back up their experiences. I've visited and eaten at S&C on four different occasions, and the food has always been hot, the noodles al dente, and the pizza divine. The service is friendly, and the staff truly makes you feel like you're sitting at momma's table. Their portions are generously served, and the prices are reasonable. They recently started serving wine and beer, and that just adds to the zest of the place.  Not only will I continue to come here for my Italian fix, but I am starting to have my business lunches here as well. You don't have to fight the rabid crowds of the strip or pay the exorbitant prices either.

WTF?  This place has gotten better as time has passed since opening. Quality ingredients like Boar's Head meats and dough made fresh keep me coming back. I admit I live close by and might not travel too far out of my way to get here if I didn't, but only because a good Italian restaurant isn't too tough to find in this town. This one is clearly better than average, or at least it is now. The growing pains are over, so take my advice and enjoy some fresh, authentic Italian cuisine next time you're in the area. Pizza and Stromboli are particularly good. You won't be disappointed unless you're as unreasonable as some of the other reviewers have been lately. I could give an honest 5-star if they served beer & wine.  Due to lack of booze and ambiance it really is only a 4-star place, but had to award the fifth star to make up for the lack of fairness shown by some other reviewers.  It's a solid 4-star, and it's only a cold beer or a pleasant glass of wine away from being a 5 'er.", "Date": "2012-03-25", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jonny", "ReviewID": "FZC62QljxueoYsNHHfT-6Q", "Overall": "1", "Content": "I tried this place out their opening week a while back.  I was pretty excited because I loved the Carmine's that use to be at this location.  I have to say I was incredibly disappointed.  The ambiance was ok.  Very similar to the restaurants that were in their previously.  I was a bit put off that you ordered at a counter and was not waited on.  Considering the prices for some of their items it would be nice to feel like you are in a restaurant.  This could be forgiven if the food was amazing or even serviceable alas....  My friend and I ordered a salad,  garlic knots, mozzarella sticks and a pizza.  We did not need this much food but wanted to try a bit of everything to see if this would be a standard place to go for us.  First they were out of the salad my friend had ordered.  We had assumed the salads were made to order but they are not they were premade in a cooler.  While I understand they were a new restaurant there is no excuse for running out of basic house salads.  If you are going to run out it would be nice if your staff was aware of this before the costumers paid.   The garlic knots were incredibly dry and tasted like something I could have made out of a Pillsbury can.  The mozzarella sticks were inedible (6 for $6.50).  This is saying something because I love cheese and I could not eat them.  They were thin, overcooked, and the breading tasted like something found on fish sticks.  The pizza was actually okay,  Nice thin crust but nothing spectacular and for the price could have gone to the pizza hut across the street and got something comparable.  To top it off the  chef  was having an argument with some gentleman who I assumed was the owner.  Which seemed fairly heated and just added to the poor experience.  I will say the young lady who was the busser was friendly and polite.  It is rare that I say I cant imagine giving a place another shot especially one that is a five minute drive from where I live, but I cant see myself doing it.", "Date": "2011-11-07", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Pacu", "ReviewID": "V81HHZZ_N3xRqSc8URHNIQ", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Grand Opening.......Grand Closing probably isn't that far behind.

A very small percentage of the pasta was a little too firm, but overall I thought the ingredients were of good quality and the taste was nice. The way the meat was prepared was in-line with proper Italian meatballs, if more on the subtle side with seasoning. The appetizers I tried were cooked perfectly and the bread that comes with the meal was quite good. The most negative thing said at my table was that the fettuccine was bland.  The place is still new and looks it, with a few holdovers from Italian restaurants of the past (music and aesthetics). Business seems to be totally dead, as there wasn't a soul aside from the owners, and judging by their excitement to see customers, I wouldn't be surprised if that's the norm. The  Grand Opening  sign is still up months later, which doesn't inspire the most confidence. Kind of shame considering the food really isn't bad. It's seriously filling (I wasn't hungry again for quite a while), though I can see how the basic style of it doesn't stand out beyond the norm. It reminds me of good homemade food rather than revolutionary, mind-blowing chef level stuff.
