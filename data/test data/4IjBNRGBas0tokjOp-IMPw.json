There were quite a few people lined up pretty early this morning and I we were about in the middle of the long line. Once the line got quite long after we've been there about a half hour before they opened up the doors to the store a couple of the Sam's Club staff came out and one-by-one asked us what deals we were interested in.  Once we informed the Sam's Club staff of the deals we were given tags of the items in the store and directions to where those items would be located. Once we were given the tags you were instructed to go to the counter, if there wasn't a line for that item, give the Sam's Club associate the tag, the Sam's Club associate will grab the item you want to purchase, then another available associate will take your item of purchase and walk you to the first available check out counter.  Some Door Busting items had long lines but if you didn't have a tag you were advised that the item was 'Sold Out'. Sam's Club was very organized to avoid any disputes or physical altercations in regards to the deals we were quite impressed. I'd recommend coming here for good customer service and good deals (when advertised).

I arrived at Sam's club about 2:15pm this afternoon and checked in. Upon trying to checkout, the manager was unable to find my order. He even went looking for himself. I am not sure what happened but the order was never pulled. I ended up getting the order myself. The manager, CHRIS, apologized numerous times and gave me a $10 gift card for my troubles. I understand glitches and whatnot happen and I accept that. However, without asking for compensation, CHRIS offered it. It  is refreshing to have a unpleasant situation bettered without having to ask for it.

Costco's stores are so full of people that you can't move. Sam's basically empty. Reasons: 1. Costco provides riding cars. About 50 per store. Tough to walk around these huge stores. Sams has 3. Horrible management. 2. People standing in line while employees stand in front chatting. 6 or 8  girls all in a group standing around talking, while, customers stand in line. Unacceptable. 3. Costco provides boxes to haul out your purchases. Sam's has nothing. They treat the customers like dirt.  4. Costco is easy to get out. Sams has 1 little old lady at the door checking purchases and she has to hand out coupons for future visits. Bullshit. Get people out the door and quit screwing around.

I shop at this location often because its fairly close to where I work.  I sometimes order pizza for my employees from here.  I love their pizzas.  If you ask nicely, they can even throw on some extra toppings.  I even come here to pick up some meat and chicken to bbq.  This location is the one that has boneless/skinless chicken thighs.

Other than that, in comparison to other Warehouse Bulk stores, easy to shop around, if you take the time, you might see specials that they are offering on certain items, always is nice to come in when they are giving samples too.

We've gone to this one several times. Greetings and promotions (gotta show your membership card) upon entering the store, which I've come to name  the swapmeet hustle.  You know, the  Can I ask you a question?  or  Do you know about....?  They've come to be a reality now whenever you go shopping at a mall setting (it's so annoying).  The layout is easy enough- it's a warehouse, basically. The items are well-stocked. It's a clean store. The employees are helpful (when asking about a product you don't see on the floor) and nice.    Sunday was our most recent visit. Samples are the weekend usual ritual here. We sampled soup, organic fruit and beef jerky. There was much more, too like, toaster strudel and some others in the frozen food section.   The best prices are: the princess (disney- very yummy) seedless green grapes for $3.98, a 24 pk. pure life bottled water for $3.98, strawberries, 2 lbs. for $3.48, chicken sausage- a large pack with 3 rows, for $11.98 (hint: freeze the rows so you have it handy), sandwich thins, 18 pk. for $3.98. We don't buy a large amount of groceries here because we only shop for ourselves (2 people can't finish these large quantities of food items). But when we shop here, we do like what we get. It's hard to beat the prices on the items I just mentioned. You also show your membership card at checkout. Keep your receipt handy; on the way out, someone will check it off.   There is a cafe, which is also very popular, due to low prices. Even with their availability of seating (picnic tables), it's always a packed house.  Parking is not a problem for us.

Although all Sam's Club locations are pretty big, this one would probably be one of the smaller locations in comparison to the newer ones around town. They also do not carry all the products I've seen at the other locations. On a positive note it's not as busy here, which makes it easier to navigate through the store. Since their carts are huge you sometimes find yourself putting so much energy into pushing your cart trying not to bump into anyone, which is not the case here. Semi empty aisles make shopping ease free. The check out lines at the other locations seem to be longer than here . They're not as strict about only having 1 sample or kids having to be with their parents in order to have 1, which is something I encountered at the SERENE location. The thing I don't understand with all Sam's Clubs is that for credit cards they only accept discover and master card? I find that kind of odd maybe an issue with banking systems? Or they are trying to persuade their members to apply for the Sam's Club Discover card?

And when my sister in law asked to talk to the manager she got the bakery manager who instead of trying to help an already very stressful situation, made it worse by having a crazy disrespectful attitude.  They gave me a cake but it was a piss poor job as far as what it looked like. No flowers because they didn't have anymore, the ribbon was jacked up.....it was no bueno.... And to top it off they even messed up the cupcakes. We asked for 30 chocolate and 30 white ended up with more chocolate than white.

My family in one form or another has held a Sams Club membership since they opened their 2nd location in Missouri 30 years ago. Some gripes about Sams Club never change and certainly apply to the Pecos location. Checkout can be slow. They don't always restock the carts. And why do they make the cashiers lift every single flat of water out of the cart? Beyond all that this location isn't flashy but it's one of the better locations I've seen in 14 states. Why?

This Sam's Club is located on Pecos and Tropicana.  It's the closest one to my house and I like it because it's clean and always well stocked.  Check out lines are usually well staffed and most of the employees I've talked to are very friendly. We always hit up the snack bar for the outrageously cheap and tasty food.    I shopped for about 30 minutes and then I went to the checkout lane.  I checked out at 5:01 PM at checkout stand #10. The total seemed a bit high but I did have a cart full of crap so I let it go and headed out to my car and loaded my things.  I put my boy into his carseat and the total kept nagging at me so I pulled out the receipt and noticed they had charged me twice for a box of probiotics that I bought.   So I drag my baby back out of his carseat and head inside and go straight to customer service with the one box of medicine and my receipt.  I wait in line for about 20 minutes because there are a few people in front of me.  I finally get to the front and I tell the lady (the one who looks just like Old Gregg) what happened.  She calls the manager and the manager says they'll have to check the security tapes. *sigh* Okay, fine.   20 more minutes roll by and by this time I'm getting mildly irritated.  First they tried to rip me off, now they've made me wait 40 minutes to correct their own mistake and made me feel like some kind of criminal in the meantime.   Finally the manager calls up and gives the cashier the go-ahead to refund the money to my card.  She does the refund and then she asks why the box of medicine I brought in doesn't have a  door tag .  I guess the 90 year old dinosaur at the front door was supposed to give me some kind of sticker that indicates that I brought the product inside.  She said she'd call the manager to check the security footage to make sure I really brought it inside and didn't just pull it off the shelf and bring it over to customer service.    Now I am losing it.  On the inside I feel my skin peel away from my skull and fire shoots out of the sockets where my eyes used to be.  I let her know that I was not happy and I want to go home.  I'd been a pretty good sport up until that time.  The solution was that the manager could walk me to the front door in leiu of having a  door tag .    I've never been so humiliated and inconvenienced.
