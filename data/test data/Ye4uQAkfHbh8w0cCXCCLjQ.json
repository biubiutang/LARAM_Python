From the time you walk in to the time you leave you feel clean and good about yourself and what you ate and have a good feeling about your lunch choice.  This location was very clean and always they are very friendly. I describe this place as like a subway type ordering system for salads, sandwiches and soups but way better. They have menus available in the line to make it easier to be ready to order and have many combo options.  One of my favorite choices is the California cob salad and the garden veggie chowder soup. Highly recommend both.    They always give you a chocolate covered strawberry and a piece of bread!  Also many beverage choices , and options with raw honey sugar alternatives in their beverages which is nice. As well as sea salt and ground pepper options on the table.  Another bonus, the charging station bar. What a great option for people on their lunch break!", "Date": "2016-12-14", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Tanja", "ReviewID": "TdSTb6vzePCEGT9_iaBTOQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Wonderful food. Cafeteria style setting, still warm and friendly. Got our food fast and easy, lots of help in working with the menu.  We both got combos ( soup / salad / sandwich, pick 2 ). I had a crab and avocado melt and mushroom bisque. My wife went with a pesto chicken and lobster bisque. Everything was delicious. For drinks, we hit the beverage bar and tried their house made Drink Infusions made with raw honey. We both agreed that the orange berry Infusion was the best. We finished it up with a couple of hand dipped strawberries, although we need to try those creme brulees next time.", "Date": "2016-10-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "ufmRB97noCPLZDWlW_8VDw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Fast service, great food, nice atmosphere.

I have to say that this is a pretty good place.  This place is located on Charleston Blvd not too far from highways so it is pretty convenient to get there, and the restaurant does offer quite a lot of parking spaces so it shouldn't be hard to park. The restaurant itself is somewhat large, but it was still difficult for us to find a free table even though we got there around 1:30pm.  We decided to take a panini and a salad since they offer both for $8.99. Service was pretty fast even though we waited in line quite a bit, but they food itself was good. This is a typical  fast-food type  kind of little place where you pay at the counter when you order.  In conclusion, I would say that this place offers a good quality/price ratio and I would recommend it.

It's the same set up as any other location but they have added whole ancient grain wheat bread to their menu! So if any of you foodies are looking for another option besides white bread they do have a substitution of wheat. They have their try 2 combo for $8.99, my personal dynamic duo is the strawberry harvest with chicken and the pesto chicken sandwich, or the Yucatan tortilla chicken soup and the glaze pork salad! It comes with a complementary bread and strawberry and towards the end of the line they have delicious creme brûlées. You are greeted at the front by their greeter where he/ she explains the entire menu and ordering process, from there you would tell the person at the front of the sale station your salad or sandwich order (if you are also or only getting soup then you would proceed down the line at their soup station!), next another person will ask you what was in your order at the dessert case to put it together on a tray - CAFE STYLE, last you'd pay. That's it! The employees are upbeat and always friendly, this is overall an amazing place to bring your family and friends for lunch and dinner.", "Date": "2016-10-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Lance", "ReviewID": "2_UrqG6PiQIN0ljkAZkIbg", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Could be better. We got a 50% off coupon in the mail so we figured we would try it out. It wasn't very obvious where to start ordering; their menu on the wall has small print so it's somewhat hard to read; I ordered a sandwich but the guy didn't ask if I wanted everything on it so by the time I said I didn't want any red pepper hummus (bleh) he said they had already made the sandwich (which had only been maybe 20 seconds, but at least they still remade it); then we were unsure about how to proceed as we made our way to the cashier; the bottled drinks in the ice bin weren't very cold but they had the same items in a refrigerator; the cashier took a while to get everything entered while another employee started crowding our trays with other trays that were piling up; then they said they would bring my daughter's sandwich out in a few minutes but it actually took 15 minutes (the rest of us were almost done eating by then); the sandwiches were lacking when it came to the ingredients (you don't get much pulled pork) and they neglected to keep the coleslaw off of it as requested.   They could be a lot more helpful and informative about what to do and how things work.

I was so frustrated that the info couldn't be found, I emailed the conpany. I was told the food was all healthy but at this time they don't offer the public nutritional info. I find this unacceptable. Everyone posts nutritional info including fast food restaurants. This leads me to think this restaraunt has something to hide.

But I can never get my homemade salad to look or taste as awesome as Cafe Zupas.  Every salad option looks appetizing.  I like one to fill me up since they're just greens.  The Thai Coconut Tofu protein salad bowl does just that!  I'm peculiar about the way they fill their soup bowls though.  Is it by weight or does it depend who's serving?  Well a half order is already a premade bowl so if its by weight that's just ppptthhh.  I'll give em yay points for their soup selections anyway.  So far I've tasted three - all really good.  I don't yet have a favorite.  The great thing is they allow you to taste it before you order.  Dessert is available! Yeah-uusss... Not too many selections, but its nice they sell it, especially their creme brulees.  Yep go ahead LOOK and STARE.    The customer service greetings are pretty general: Hi welcome! How are you? For here or to go? Would you like to try a sample? Will there be anything else for you? Can I offer you a dessert? There you go kids... if you're about to start the job experience workforce in foodservice, that's my 10 cents right there.  Customers walk thru a people guided ordering system.  With their sometimes long lines, it helps and the lines flow pretty quickly.  The pay system is also jiffy; run your card, no signature, and your receipt spits out.  Have a nice day!  Review is a one star lacker only cuz the soup issue and maaaaybe so-so pricey.  I'd still come back anyway.", "Date": "2016-12-22", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Griselda", "ReviewID": "DwE5bwyV3-dgAPsx3_0qyQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I ordered the Wisconsin Cauliflower soup and the Chicken Pesto sandwich.  The food is delicious and you can see it is prepared fresh.  And my co-workers were satisfied with their meals too.   My only complaint is you give me a plastic container to hold my sandwich.  A BIG container... and then everything else is thrown in the bag individually.  Why when the plastic clear box looks to hold everything inside? I found this frustrating when trying to figure out who's sandwich goes with which soup, etc.  The boxes look like they should contain one complete order inside.  There are 3 people working the counter - 2 cashiers and 1 just to pack the items.  It wouldn't hurt to take the time to pack it right so it's easy to carry out.  Especially when dealing with multiple orders from the same person.", "Date": "2017-01-13", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jessica", "ReviewID": "aNRn0KvxZ7NlWFojEF5Cjw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Love the salads, soups and sandwiches at this cafe!

I've been to different locations & it's like this at every location.   There is a different person at each station; sandwich/salad, soup, dessert, & cashier. Today I got asked 4 separate times if my order was for here or to-go. 4 times! They ask you at every 'station'. I was asked what food I ordered at dessert area...then one step to the right the cashier asked what I ordered again so she can ring it up. So after repeating the same answers, at the end they have you say your whole specific order (annoying when you order for a whole family). It is just unnecessary to have that many people fulfill your order!!

No place to sit so we ordered to go. Little did i know that if you order 4 or more things to go you have to go to the end register to order...

Would have been nice to know all this and save us some time. They gave us free drinks which made it ok but still annoyed. Food is great. Tasty panini sandwiches, (dessert) salads and soups.

I felt patronized as I was ordering my food, and then they got it wrong... Then as I went to use a coupon and there was big stipulation in using it, so simple, it's a coupon! Ended up not getting to use them I just didn't want the argument about it. Then as my friend, Who is ordering separately, was trying to use the same coupon, and the manager I assume, said an extremely snide comment to my friend, I said  there's no need for snide comments  well he got mad I said something and decided to kick me out of the store. I was in no way yelling or making a fuss. He made the store look very bad by kicking somebody out when I was walking right out anyways. And also he put his hands on me not in a physical hurtful way, but you are not supposed to touch people especially customers, again I was walking right out there was no need for touching.

I've missed Cafe Zupas as I haven't gone since I lived closer to their Lake Mead? location. I'm not a fan of the layout, it takes so long to get from the front door to the line and then having to rummage your way over through the tables was uncomfortable. I should have used the side door but wasn't sure if it was an emergency only door when I first arrived.   I ordered the Mango Berry Salad, it was delicious I just wish they used spinach or a better type of leaf as some of mine were browning otherwise totally a great veggie salad! Also had a cup of soup which was perfect and exactly what I needed to end my day.  The Salad associate was very friendly, warm greeting loved interacting with her. The Soup associate was kind of rude and not friendly at all. The General Manager was very friendly but he made it awkward, very awkward when he kept thinking I was the mom of the kid in front of me in line....no sir I have no kids, nice of you to assume i'm a good mother but no that mother was sitting down and making her kid order all the food and pay not me. So it was just awkward having to stop him from letting the kid almost pay for my meal.  The  bus girl  was very nice, she wished me a good evening when I was getting my iced tea to go and that was unexpected.

Noisy, hectic, unpleasant.  Metal chairs make a cringy scraping noise on the polymer floor.  Horrific stun tunes blare over what sounds like a cheap boombox. This is what the dining public seems to prefer, so the typical Yelper will give Zupas five stars for atmosphere.  As you walk in you are confronted by a bevy of order takers, soup getters and salad fixers doing their best to cope with the stressful conditions.  They are lined up cheek by jowl, invading each other's personal space.  Everyone's shouting, so you can't hear what's being said.  I said  huh?  to one and he snappishly repeated himself.  Luckily printed menus are available.  No way could I read the complicated fine printed posted on the wall.    The sparse sandwich ingredients are squeezed within crusty Ciabatta. You need a good set of choppers to blast through the slabs.  Mine was a turkey-spinach-artichoke (TSA).  There was no identifiable taste of artichoke.  Not much taste of anything for that matter.   I had a Try 2 Combo, which leaves about a cup of soup.  My New England clam chowder (with bacon) was tasty.  An extra star.  A chocolate-dipped strawberry was included with our meals.  Is this just a grand opening treat?  Will they charge for it later?  For gadget addicts, Zupas has a  charge bar  where you can plug in.    Anti-mayo:  Lucinda wanted mayonnaise.  Zupas is anti-mayo.  There was none to be found anywhere on the premises.  And you shouldn't ask for mayo in an eatery that features a line of  signature  sandwich spreads.", "Date": "2016-10-31", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Paul", "ReviewID": "w9Y8m9osmUGXZcL1HaKFRw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I love cafésZupas cafeteria style food.
