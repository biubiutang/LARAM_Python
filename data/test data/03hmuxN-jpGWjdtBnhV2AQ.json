I went on a Friday night when they have karaoke sponsored by Maximum Comics. Such fun!  It's a total dive bar, but in that way that is just awesome. They have seats around the bar, as well as some hightop tables. There's a small stage, a DJ (or in this case KJ) booth, some room for dancing, pool tables, etc.  They have gaming and will comp drinks. They also have drink specials. They have very little on draft, but lots of bottle options for beer. The bartender was super nice, attentive, and funny.  The bathrooms weren't scary. And there's a free condom dispenser too.  It was a cool crowd - just enough people to be fun. Not too many people to be crowded.  There's also a little place to order food from. The food is super cheap and surprisingly quite tasty. I don't know if the nachos were the best in all of Vegas, but they were darn good and loaded with toppings (and so cheap). They most definitely hit the spot.  In sum, this is a great dive and I had a blast.", "Date": "2016-04-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jez", "ReviewID": "iAJIijPFNXi1w1kWUlZV8A", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Somehow I'm currently the Yelp Duke of this place.  What?! HOW??   So it's divey and super casual and that's FIIIINE by me. It's nice to go to a place where the chill and friendly GM will come out and have a drink with you and talk to you about theater.  Or see a drag show.  Or get pulled onstage for Karaoke.    I don't regularly go here (maybe every six months?), but the few times I have, it's been relaxed with a chill crowd and it's exactly what you want.  A good 3AM gimme-a-drink gay bar with no attitude.    (I did a Blue Moon pub crawl and my ONE complaint is that my orange slice in my beer was like, the tiniest sliver. I've had limes bigger, lol!)", "Date": "2016-02-08", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Theresa", "ReviewID": "q50dYCMphx_iea9dYdchng", "Overall": "5", "Content": "They play Beyonce and Hanson what more could you ask for in life.

Yes, after 30 minutes, whether you smoke or not, you WILL smell like a gigantic ashtray when you leave.  Yes, it's a bit trashy and probably the best place to troll for a lunchtime shag.  Yes, they have strippers, and drag queens and karaoke....OH MY!!!!  And, I gotta tell ya', probably the most laid back drunken brawl of a good time that you'll never regret.  FLEX should be a Vegas landmark.  If it's not, make it one now on your own terms.  If you're pretentious and need to be in a smokeless ultra lounge, I would suggest anywhere but here. ( or maybe a procedure to remove the  no fun  stick from your booty.)  So......go to FLEX...NOW!!!!  Get FLIRTY, Get DIRTY, Get KRUNK!!!!  Cuz at the FLEX if you don't.....you don't belong.   Goobah Gahbah ONE OF US!!!!!!   ( I know it's not subtle at all, but i really wanted you to know what it's like there.......if the above makes no sense then look below.)

Anyway, we arrived earlier in the evening (9, 10??) with a group of about 7.  Later in the evening, there was drag performers...who were very nice and patient with my quite drunk sister in law.  It never got crowded the entire evening...and the patrons looked like locals who wanted to play lottery at the bar.   Anyway, the drink were moderately priced -- and the staff was adequate.  The place is smaller...with some pool tables.  The  stage  is not really a stage at all, as its located in a small corner of the bar.  Anyway, we enjoyed our stay at Flex for the most part...but we haven't been back, so I don't know what that means :-p", "Date": "2010-03-01", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Marvin", "ReviewID": "VpDXNvdsi2th5K0gnFeajw", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Was visiting from out of town, so called this place to see when their good night was and they said it was Friday, when they have drag show and strippers/dancers.  Called Friday evening to find out time of drag show, and person who answered phone said midnight.  Us 8 visitors arrived at 11:45pm, and by 12:45am, the drag show still hadn't started *and* there were no strippers or dancers anywhere.  Place only had about 20 people, with an empty dancefloor that was about 10' x 10'.  I was embarrassed to have brought my fellow visitors to this place--wish we had gone somewhere else.

I made the mistake of taking a cab out there. If you're going I'd suggest driving, or going in a Vegas where Uber exists.

Upon walking in it quickly becomes evident that dive it is not. Ultra lounge is ain't either. This place is well sized and well laid out for the local queer community. This is a good hometown gay watering hole.  Sure you're in Vegas but if you like to see how the locals roll, then this is a queer staple.   Another Yelp reward spot- upon checking in at Flex, Yelp rewards pop up with a $2 shot of any UV vodka.   Hump day in Vegas doesn't yield a packed house but it's not overwhelming for those who don't do crowds. Two pool tables , double dart boards and strategically placed digital slots built into the bar provide enough to single or multi-player entertainment.  Draft beer choices are limited to 2 - the usual suspects for any gay bar across America (bud light and blue moon). Aging up you drink to the cocktail level opens up double full bars sporting what seems like the entire catalog of UV vodka, 5 rows of Absolut choices along with plenty of other bar hard Liquors.   It's Vegas and smoking inside bars and casinos is still legal. Most local watering holes ( and most casinos) have a constant cloud of cigarette smoke causing those non-smokers to either constantly worry about their clothes or choke while just trying to breathe.  At flex the industrial AC and plenty of ceiling fans keep the air flow going and the spacious layout keeps you from having the very light 2nd hand smoke hard to detect. I'm not saying that one can't tell, it's just not the smokey dive you might expect.   Throughout the venue plenty of tv screens keep you updated on specials and all play the same thing simultaneously so no area of the bar offers a blind spot to the bar info. A vending machine offers standard blend of chips to candy bars to gum. Otherwise if you need to carb up or got the munchies this is not a one stop solution.   The decor is modestly modern without any uber fanciness. Artfully placed color changing lights  and led ribbons add a rainbow effect throughout the space without being overtly  gay  ( the M4M PDA does this just fine).  Lighting is more colorful than helpful for seeing and somehow this dark bar just doesn't seem like a dark boozey place.   The clientele here are real people. No pretension, no drama queens, no lottery winners here.  Dress code is a blend of those who just got off work and those who just put on slippers and walked here.", "Date": "2016-01-14", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Teddy", "ReviewID": "valIx_pwr_1f8bwNITArvQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "My last night in Vegas on memorial day weekend I headed here with Tiny (Luke) and had a blast.

Overall drinks were poured generously and the clientele was entertaining. Of course by the time we ordered our 3rd cocktail we were getting close to missing our flight and had to slam it and run back to our hotel to pick up our luggage.

I wasn't expecting much after perusing the reviews left on Yelp but I really didn't expect to be walking into a smoke filled nightmare. funny thing was they actually had a VIP section. i'm kind of ranting here but it's because I can't wrap my brain around how horrible the place is. It's like going to a garage party when you were in High school but take away the hot guy you had a crush on and replace him with the 8th year senior that's at all the parties.   oh and i had to do laundry after because EVERYTHING i was wearing smelled like the carpet in the suncoast casino.

You can either walk up, or come out of curtains along the back. I liked that effect, and it's gives the queens options :)  I guess there used to be strippers here. I saw plenty of high heels and sparkly dresses, but no strippers :-(   The bar was modern looking, almost like it would belong in a steakhouse or some chain restaurant. The only thing that I thought was weird was when I tried to pay with a card, the bartender asked me if that's all I wanted to put on it. When I was like,  ummm, yeah I guess. Why?  He informed me that you can't add the tip after. You had to add it before he rung you up. Ohhhhhh-kaaaay. Thought that was a little weird, but whatever.
