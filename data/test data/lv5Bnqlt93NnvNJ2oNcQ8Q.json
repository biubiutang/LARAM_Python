We both each had a margarita at half price and I will say the margarita was pretty good, not the greatest but very good. The food was excellent! I had the fajitas a la poblana and it was amazing. Incredible flavor, and the steak was awesome. It was cool to have some authentic mariachi music by their live band but it was pretty loud so it was hard to talk to people at the table. The service was excellent everyone checks up on you including the manager multiple times. My only complaint was when we got change for a bill that we paid for with cash, the server only gave me change to either give him a $2 tip or a $20 for a $50 bill. I don't mind giving 20 or even 25% tip but when you're trying to force me to give you a 40% tip, that doesn't fly too well with me. Lucky for him we were in a good mood so I got change from the bar to give him a good tip but do not try and force me to tip you nearly half the price of my bill unless you want me to only give you the $2 change that I had left.

The chicken in the  fajitas tasted like it was meant for a Chinese dish with a strong taste of soy sauce on a bed of onions; Literally just onions and chicken. Sucked!  Tortillas could have been good if they were not served on a paper towel in a French fry basket. They got hard after about 2 minutes.   Service was subpar with the waiter not asking our preference of beans or tortillas.   Chips and salsa were okay. The avocado dip tasted like green sour cream.

This is a small chain from Texas and the food is good, if atypical, Southwestern style Mexican food. Los Cucos can't compete with Vegas local powerhouse Lindo Michoacan, but it still has pretty good eats and great service.   The interior is strange, a rag-tag looking atmosphere in what is (obviously) a space formerly inhabited by MiMi's Cafe. The Mardi Gras balcony is still there, but now there's some sparse, randomly placed Mexican decor lining the walls. The restaurant feels spacious, open and clean, and there's a particularly nice open bar area right inside the front door. The place lacks character, but it's a pleasant enough atmosphere.   I had to laugh at the menu because it's loaded with misspellings ( crispi  tacos,  romain  lettuce) and some of the descriptions are exactly the same for different items (check out the special fajitas on the menu). When I pointed this out to our server, she couldn't explain it nor tell me which item it was that was the correct description. I eventually got what I wanted, but the menu had the dish listed under two different names. You'd think for a chain restaurant, the menu would be consistent (and free of spelling errors).   As with most Mexican eateries, the house serves complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were good enough but served cold; the salsas are DELICIOUS. Like seriously delicious. There's a spicy, smoky red salsa that's served warm and a fantastic avocado crema style cold salsa. Both of these were the highlight of my meal and I am still craving them (they'll make me return to the restaurant often).   We ordered the queso with shrimp as an appetizer. At $11.95, it's overpriced. The cheese wasn't that warm when it was served and the queso was loaded with red onions, mushrooms and other unnecessary stuff. The shrimp was seasoned well and quite delicious; however, I wouldn't order this again.   For lunch I ordered chicken fajitas and my husband ordered steak fajitas. The meat quality was top-notch. I LOVED the marinade on both of the meats, and we both agreed the meat was some of the best in town. The fajita vegetables were just okay -- onions and poblano peppers. I was disappointed in the overall fajitas, but I'd love to have just the meat served on its own. I had fajitas that came  loaded  with bacon and cheese, and it was an unusual and very tasty combo. The side plate was huge and had so/so beans, average rice, and very tasty guacamole and pico de gallo.   Fatty alert: they serve homemade flour tortillas, and they are delicious! I love Mexican restaurants that care enough to make legit tortillas, and I'm happy that Los Cucos does it right. I could've eaten two dozen of them! It's a bummer that they aren't served in tortilla warmers to keep them soft but instead are plopped on the table sandwiched between paper towels. This means the tortillas get hard very quickly. Best to gobble them up as soon as possible!  After our lunch, Jesus the manager came over to ask how we enjoyed everything. He was very eager to please and happy to listen to our suggestions. I was very impressed with this personal touch and the efficient, friendly service we received.   This isn't the best Mexican food in Vegas, but the kitchen uses very high quality ingredients, the prices on most menu items are fair, and the service is good. This is a great place to add to the dining rotation, especially if you live near Mountain's Edge and the Arroyo.", "Date": "2017-01-04", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "SJannet", "ReviewID": "UmWlzYiJKmTf8brdXNqhrQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "The cucos restaurant THE BEST !

We have eaten many times at the restaurants in Texas. While not the greatest Tex-Mex, it is certainly not the worst (at least in Texas). We decided to try the new location off Arroyo Crossing. The restaurant is nice and clean and the service is fast. My wife and I had a sampler plate which contained fairly typical Tex-Mex offerings. Overall, we were quite disappointed. It has little resemblance to the restaurants in the same chain in Texas. The enchilada was without any flavor whatsoever. The refried beans had an unusual texture and taste and were somewhat overdone. The rice was anything but Tex-Mex. The beef fajita meat was actually pretty good. The tortillas were fair. The price though was considerably higher than the same restaurant plates in Texas. While we were hoping for a true Tex-Mex restaurant in Las Vegas, this one missed the mark. The lack of flavor and seasoning were disappointing-- akin to a Mexican TV dinner.

Usually Mexican restaurants bring out food thrown on some colored plates, but these had some love and time put in to presentation.  They also give you warm chips with 2 sauces for free.

I have to admit, I walked in with pretty low expectations but they proved me wrong. Walked in on a Friday night famished! As soon as we walked in we were greeted and seated immediately. A few moments later our waitress came over to drop off chips and salsa, both green/red and took our drink requests. Soon after that another employee approached us and asked if we wanted to order guacamole, we of course said yes, she walked away only to return with a cart..she proceeded to make the guacamole right in front of us, after she was done, she asked us to taste it to make sure we approved of it, definitely a major plus.   Looking through the menu, everything looked pretty tasty but what caught my attention was the stuffed avocados. I was curious and intrigued so I went right ahead and ordered one. Food came out pretty quick and right away my mouth started salivating, my plate came with tortilla soup, beans, rice, a fajita taco and my stuffed avocado, big portions so come hungry. The stuffed avocado was breaded on the outside, despite it being cooked, the avocado was firm and fresh and it was filled with cheddar cheese and steak, happy bells went off in my head as soon as I took that first bite. The only downside to my dish was the fajita taco, they put a layer of cheese on top of it and melted it but it tasted like a kraft slice, other than that my meal was perfect. On another note, I noticed that their rice tasted just like Pollo Loco's, not their current rice but the way they used to make it years ago before they changed their recipe. That made me an even bigger fan! I washed everything down with a peach margarita, it was pretty good and you have the option of choosing salt or sugar for the rim.   Overall, I really liked this restaurant and I'll definitely be stopping by again, service was quick, staff was super friendly and very attentive, our waitress was on top of it.

When I walked in and asked them, I was elated to find out that it was the same!   And that they have the same menu.  They have an On The Border here, which is a Tex-Mex place, however, the menu is very different than the ones in Texas.  The Los Cucos menu was not.  It was the same!!!   I was very, very pleased to see that the cheese enchiladas were served with chili con carne or chili gravy instead of the disgusting red or green chile that most of these west coast places put on their enchiladas.  And they were good.  And the refried beans were perfect.  Some places make them too runny.  These were very good.  The service was excellent.  I had multiple managers come to the table and speak with me, and that was great.  My two complaints were that I was not a fan of the rice.  Although, I remember I didn't care for it when I went to the locations in Texas either.  For some reason, there was corn and carrots in it.  Just give me plain Spanish Rice.  Also, I used to like the red sauce they served with the chips in Texas.  However, I was not a fan of either of the sauces they served with the chips, and they were a little stale.

Hours later I can still feel the pain in my mouth.", "Date": "2017-01-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Emily", "ReviewID": "aBusRbO3HZt1HGR5f2csWg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Nice sit-down alternative to the taco shop type Mexican that is ubiquitous in Las Vegas valley (I'm looking at you, Roberto's and Don Tortaco). To start they give you generous portions of chips and their two salsas which I've found not so common since moving here. Menu prices are a bit high but the potion sizes are reflective (we ended up with a box to take home). The restaurant was clean. Food took a good while to come out but the servers were attentive and took notice when it seemed to be taking too long. Steak for fajitas was well seasoned. And tamales weren't dry at all. Beans had great flavor. Even my kids' meals were delicious when I sampled them and the portions were very generous.", "Date": "2016-12-31", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Marlena", "ReviewID": "LwL6Og3uGFGp_XALg5yQ-Q", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Never had before and I have to say I was impressed.

We ordered the spicy  cucumber margarita which was amazing, comes with two glasses and a bottle.  When she brought it over, half of the bottle poured on the table and made its way to the floor splashing on to my shoe and pant.  She apologized but didn't offer to give us the 15.99 bottle half off, so we ordered another one to give her the opportunity, nope.  The next thing we noticed was extremely unprofessional.  The people next to us had a different waitress, they had already received their drinks and placed their orders.  They decided to move tables and I guess the new table they chose was now our waitresses.  As the other waitress brought out the food to the guests who were now at a different table, our waitress literally stood like two inches from her face saying they were her guests, she was so close to her, the other waitress couldn't even get around her to serve the guests.  She should have handled this in the back of house, not caused a scene in front of multiple guests.    I can't remember the waitresses name tother than the first letter of her name, S.  she also wore braces and a thin head band with white flowers on it.  We will definitely go back because of the food and ambience but will be requesting any server but her.", "Date": "2017-01-15", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jeff", "ReviewID": "7H8-tuv5mze7zfycMhk4TA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "This used to be a Mimis Cafe and u can still see the old mimis layout inside. The interior is nothing exciting at all but I'll come back to that. I've watched for months as they converted the place into a mexican restaurant and eagerly waited for them to open. The food is really good. The salsas they bring out with the chips are not traditional. The red salsa was heated in the oven and the greenish salsa was like an aioli mayo based concoction. I didn't mind either but my friend was not a fan.  Margaritas were cheap and very good. We ordered a large variety platter for 2 people to share and it was so good. We received steak and chicken fajitas, grilled shrimp, a green onion and bacon sauce, rice, beans and more.  The perfectly seasoned steak was so tender it just fell apart in my mouth. After that I didn't expect much from the chicken but it was also perfectly seasoned and so soft. I would definitely give the food 5 stars and the staff could not have been any more friendly and on top of things. The only dissapoitment is regarding the interior design. The walls are pretty bare and there aren't any cool mexican decorations.  It looks more like a cafe than a full restaurant.  If they could get an interior designer in here to make it look more like Panchos or Lindo they would be golden.", "Date": "2016-12-30", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Teri", "ReviewID": "-0p0evO3IhGMKjjUNTZIxg", "Overall": "3", "Content": "It was just ok.

Their food has a lot of flavors. I ordered the Mexican bowl (rice, beans, veggies, fajita chicken) with two different salsa...the tomatillo green salsa is sour and spicy(its great). My husband ordered El Gringo which comes with rice, beans, salad, enchelada, tacos, fajita beef with fresh flour tortilla.  Both of our meats were tasty and have a lot of flavors. The only thing negative I can say is that the fresh flour tortilla gets hard so fast and my husband says that his beef was a little dry other than that It was great. I recommend all of you to try it.

My grandma got the same thing with shrimp in it and loved it. My mom got the same thing with only cheese. She loved it as well! The soup is DELICIOUS! The homemade flour tortillas are amazing too!!! My grandparents are so happy they found a great Mexican restaurant nearby! When we are back in Vegas next time we will be coming back here! I highly recommend this restaurant!
