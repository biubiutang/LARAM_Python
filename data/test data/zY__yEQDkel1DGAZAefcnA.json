First off the music is amazing!! Dj Corona keeps us dancing from the minute We step in till We leave (usually Closing time). The bartenders never leave you waiting very attentive and nice. Gorgeous go-go's who even take the time to teach this girl how to perfect her twerk the owner Christian makes us feel Like VIP's every time checking in with us to make sure we are having a great time! My husband and I prefer Krush over any straight club hands down!!!", "Date": "2016-09-07", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "A", "ReviewID": "X5GuBPC3G0n0PQIcdiSCeQ", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Terrible place! On Thursday, me and some friends decided to check out this place. Discovered that they open at 10pm, so we decided to go to Charlie's before to pregame. Had a great time there, but we decided to head over to Krush not too far away. We get there and they ask us for ID and metal detector check us, which I appreciate. The place was almost empty, and didn't really look like a nice club at that, we wanted to have a drink and walk around. We get to the bar, and the bartender kind of ignored us for 10 or 15 minutes, and when he finally got to us, I asked for one of their signature cocktails and after going to the other tender to ask about it, clearly he had no idea, he said they didn't have the ingredients for it. My friend asked for a glass of wine, he turned around, opened a few door and drawers confused and said they had no wine. So we get just a regular vodka cocktail, and when I gave him my card, he said that the bar is cash only. Seriously? So we left and went back to Charlie's where the staff was super nice, we got our drinks, and could pay with a card. I will not be back to Krush, and will encourage my friends and clients (I'm a concierge) to skip this mess of a place.", "Date": "2016-08-05", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "B", "ReviewID": "aedwthGGvWB5d-hXcy3DjQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Beautiful venue, great drinks and prices.

The cocktail waitresses excellent. The dancers were unbelievable. The hosts gorgeous. The music fantastic. Thank you to everyone on the dance floor. Your combined energy made our party such a blessing - We had the best time drinking and dancing at Krush. We arrived late with a birthday boy turning 21 years old and you took care of us like no other club with buckets of champagne, vodka, drinks, cranberry juice, pineapple, music, we had our own private cocktail waitresses with a dancer on the stage next to us. The dancers were sweet. They took photos with all of us during their break. Seductive lyrics, great moves, excellent music: Thank you to the amazing team at Krush for the best party Labor Day Weekend 2016. I would return every week if I could. Each person I spoke to felt the same way. They all agreed that we had the best time dancing with our party at Krush.", "Date": "2016-09-05", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Kay", "ReviewID": "iM8_Cj9DfKAt7b0MB38LYg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Omg, best gay club I've been to in awhile..
