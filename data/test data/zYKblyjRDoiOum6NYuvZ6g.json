Today, I happened to wait close to 10 minutes for a drink that wasn't custom made during a time when NO ONE else was there.

HOWEVER....  The seating area is crowded and to navigate your way to the cashier to order is a mess.  The place where you get your drinks from the barista is also right against the door which means if there is a drink line, then that blocks incoming and outgoing traffic.  Along with the crowded seating area, trying to get coffee here is like trying to navigate an accident where it goes from 4 lanes to 1.  Drinks wise, it's typical after Starbucks had their worldwide shutdown training.   Consistent drinks across the board.   But the whole having to navigate through a sea of people is not really my taste in store layout.

I'm not giving 3 stars for the place, but for the drinks I've gotten from here thus far. Compared to the Starbucks on my side of town, where my drinks always come out pretty much perfect, and the Starbucks on the Air Force Base, where I also frequent, this Starbucks gave me  okay  drinks.  For instance yesterday I ordered my typical Non-Fat Ice White Mocha with no whip and I left with it. When I got in my car and was going down the road, I took a sip and thought it tasted way, way too bitter. It almost had a sour undertone to it.

This is one of the reasons why I stopped going to Starbucks.   I walked in because I was walking into work this morning and I was cold, so I said why not stop in and grab something warm. Well I haven't stepped foot in a Starbucks in a year.   I got tired of drinking flavored coffee drinks full of high fructose corn syrup. And yes unless it's sugar free all of their flavors have it! I used to be a barista and we brewed all the Starbucks stuff and used their sauces, the whole nine yards. Even was trained by Starbucks on exactly how to make everything. Oh and btw Seattle's Best is owned by Starbucks. But the other reason I quit going to Starbucks is because the people are rude just like their customers.   I walked in standing away from the counter looking at the menu trying to see what's new or sounds good. The cashier yells can I help you like I'm deaf or there are people everywhere. I was the only one there. I said still looking. Then people came in I waved a few by and got in line. I get up there and the same girl says are you ready now? Instead of asking a question about a drink I said grande Carmel macchiato that's it. Handed her my card and then waited for my drink. Watched her not even do the crisscross stuff just a swirl. Got my drink and asked the barista for a stopper and left. Had she made the drink right it would have tasted right. Just tasted like coffee with cream.
