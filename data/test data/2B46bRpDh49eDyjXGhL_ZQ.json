I am from New Zealand and my partner is French. I have also spent some time in France, so we both know a good crepe when we eat one.   Safe to say this place met our expectations, the owner is a lovely woman and her cooking skills are superb. One of the nicest meals I have had in the US since being here.

I was an 18 year old exchange student living with a basque family of 10. Every day I had crepes! They were waiting when I came home from school around 1 pm.  I fell in love with crepes!  Maggie's crepes had me reveling and time traveling back to those days. . Excellent crepes. Perfect earl grey tea.  Super friendly staff. The savory crepes are made with buckwheat so they are gluten free.  The ingredients were fresh and complimented each other very well.  Love this spot!  Highly recommended! bravo!", "Date": "2017-01-15", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "A.", "ReviewID": "InfFrwMSS-6UGpJxYP2s-Q", "Overall": "4", "Content": "The crepes are definitely a great quality and are quite tasty.  Sweet?  Savory?  Delicious.  Major downsides are the price and size.  The crepes are obviously not very filling and they are quite expensive.  These are not really an expensive item to make, or rather, should not be.  The crepes are $8 or $9 a piece and come with pretty much nothing else, so a lunch with 1 sweet and 1 savory will easily be $20 and might not fill you up if you are hungry.  The quality is definitely high and the taste is great though.", "Date": "2016-09-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Mel", "ReviewID": "Lru_GayU_xSmhLCuexja3Q", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Loved Maggie's place!

Apparently they even bring their flour from France. Their prices are reasonable and the customer service is very good. I ordered a sweet and salty crepe. My favorite were the sweet options. I tried the Nutella and bananas as well as the pear and cinnamon. They were both great. Their sweet fruit glazed was very tasty. For my savory option I had the chicken with mushroom and mozzarella cheese. I liked the texture of the crepe and the flavor of the mushroom. However, I wish the crepe would have include some type of sauce on top as it lacked a bit of flavor.

I personally don't like them. Well - that has changed. The crepes Maggie makes are TOTALLY different. So thin and crispy on the outside but soft in the middle. How you can have that much texture in something so thin, I do not know. But she does it. I ate every bite of mine. We opted for sweet options because we had lunch in a few hours. The savory options looked even more appetizing but we didn't want to fill up.  Seriously 5 stars.

Offering up crepes and galettes, I've visited twice in an attempt to widen my French food horizons.  Upon entering the caf√© on my most recent visit, the sweet smell of strawberry basil jam being cooked on the stove greeted my gal pal and I.  Chef Maggie was making a new batch to sell and I'm sure it went quickly.  I had my first galette, the July special, with mozzarella, tomato, goat cheese, and honey.  You can sit at the counter and watch your food being made in front of you.  Using authentic buckwheat and wheat flour imported from France for her crepes and galettes, Chef whipped up our orders in no time.   My galette was delicious, especially with the pairing of the cheese with the honey.  Chef Maggie also let us sample the freshly made strawberry basil jam: ooh la la!  This is food made with love from a real French chef.

My wife and I ate there yesterday for the first time. We went based on a review in Vegas Weekly...very glad we did. The food was outstanding...the coffee was excellent. But, beyond that, I have a deep appreciation for her commitment to being a  one woman  show. It just really has that authentic vibe. Maggie took our order, then slipped behind the counter to prepare the food herself....totally old school. I also appreciate the large tables...the power outlets at each table...and my wife loves the purse hooks, which may seem trivial to some, but is a nice convenience. On top of everything else, Maggie herself is very endearing and clearly loves feeding people...she's the kind of person you want to see succeed. Which is why I'm writing a review...which I don't normally do. BTW.....Her homemade jams are otherworldly !", "Date": "2016-08-05", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Paulina", "ReviewID": "HMpKT8sMxlFOzwaA666TBw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Super yummy, very glad I stopped by!

I'm not sure about other times, but our visit was very.. French lol. We were probably the only non-French speakers in the restaurant at the time, which added to the cafe's charm. Although I was too full to order a dessert crepe, my husband and I each got a galette. They were both filling and tasty, but my unrefined American palette would prefer more sauce (or ketchup lol) so it doesn't taste too dry. I would highly recommend getting a smoothie with your order; the smoothie we ordered was so refreshing and had a nice balance of greens and sweetness from the fruit.
