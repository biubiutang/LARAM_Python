We started with the Twice Baked Cajun Wings & their bottomless breadstick basket. Cajun is the style, not flavor, so we got to choose our flavor. Upon the advise of our server Mateo, we got the garlic parmesan...10 absolutely yummy baked wings with bits of roasted garlic pieces. The breadsticks were soft and warm, and fresh! Not microwaved, so they didn't get hard when they cooled off & remained soft. Served with butter, but I preferred to poke it on the wings plate to get those yummy bits of garlic instead. Oh yeah!  We ordered the Tilapia Francaise & Meatloaf entrees. Tilapia was a garlic lemon butter creation of awesomeness...with LOTS of garlic bits, so you better like garlic or ask for an alternative to the way it's prepared if you don't. Luckily for us, we were down for it. Meatloaf was homemade and came with two generous slices crisped on the flat-top, with mushroom gravy. Some places slather with  eh  tasting gravy, but their mushroom gravy was really good (lots of button mushroom slices and not over salted at all).  Both dinners came with soup or salad (both good), veggie of the day (nice fresh green beans cooked perfectly, still crunchy and good), and choice of potato.  If you are in the neighborhood, or even if you are not, make your way on over to Sunset off Boulder and pop into the Klondike for some good food at Sarah's Kitchen. You won't be disappointed.", "Date": "2016-10-23", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Westie", "ReviewID": "j9m7RHdOT0cmRtA3qbagHA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "The casino is petite with this cafe accounting for possibly 30-40% of the total space. Seating options include tables, booths, the counter and the patio. The dining room is spacious and we found the service to be pretty attentive.  My wife and I each chose the $1.49 breakfast special of 2 eggs (easy over please), 3 slices of bacon (yes!), toast (wheat) and hash browns. My wife also ordered a coffee that cost 80 cents more than her eggs though she did get 2 refills.

The eggs were not exact, the pancakes had a bit of a hard skin (too much heat lamp, maybe).  Lunch today, less wait, but food was just  OK , not excellent.  The specials are very inexpensive and filling.  After being closed for years, the Klondike Casino on Sunset Ave has reopened.  Sarah's Kitchen is inside the casino.  I think the staff are still learning their jobs, and there are some personnel issues they need to sort out before this place could be considered decent.  Overall, the service is slow.  The food specials are a good value.  The food quality is passable.  I hope the front of house and back of house improve because this place is close to my house.  The bread served with the spaghetti and meatball lunch special was gummy.  The spaghetti was boiled too long (it gets big and too soft).  The sauce was good.  The meatballs were good.  The cheese was good.  Getting your drink refilled can be a bit difficult because the wait staff are still learning the basics (but they are friendly, so some things can be forgiven).  I've been here 2 times now, once for breakfast, and once for lunch and each time, order accuracy (forgetting to put drinks on the bill) and prompt service have been issues.", "Date": "2016-08-16", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Margaret", "ReviewID": "ZaUYaudvfEZ3ra5xpbReNw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "This is a hidden gem. We did wait about 10 minutes for a table but that was because they were packed. I had the deuces breakfast, it came with 2 of the following, pancakes, bacon, sausage links and eggs for 2.99.

When you first open the door of the casino it has a very strong cigarette smell, but inside the restaurant no issue at all. I was seated by a friendly girl who informed me the prime rib special that night was $5.55. That's old school Vegas pricing which is hard to find these days. The menu is your standard diner fare offering up a little bit of everything. I chose the meat loaf and the wife got fried chicken. Both dishes were better than I would have imagined, and the portions were huge. Both dinners included a small dinner salad. Our server Rose was fast, friendly, and attentive. I'm new to the area and never visited the old Klondike, but I will definitely return if I want some tasty diner food at a more than fair price.", "Date": "2016-09-02", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Melissa", "ReviewID": "yejctDaEB54_5kHIwW6uWw", "Overall": "1", "Content": "I can not write a review on the food because I never got to try it.  I tried to be open minded because the reviews were mixed but I can confirm the service here is horrible. We were seated and after 10 mins of being ignored we gave up and left. I get places can be busy (though there were several open seats in the small restaurant) but you can at least acknowledge someone and let them know it will be just a minute.", "Date": "2016-10-03", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Tim", "ReviewID": "SCKQ-1XjI-E1tNEeh2nLtw", "Overall": "3", "Content": "It's probably exactly what a reasonable person would expect from a recently renovated, small 'locals' casino -- clean & modern 24/7 cafe with a basic menu, decent food & cheap to fair prices.  I ordered the onion rings as an appetizer, & the Meatballs & Spaghetti as the main course, however, as a vegetarian, I asked for just spaghetti marinara -- no meatballs!  First out was a small salad, which comes with the entree.  It was good.  Next out were the onion rings -- about 8-10 rings of various sizes, and Ranch dressing as a dipping sauce.   The onion rings were pretty greasy, as I suppose most are, so I'm not complaining, however I do expect a big stomach-ache from them at any moment -- hopefully I'll be home by then!   I do wish more places would get rid of (more of) the grease before serving onion rings, or set them down atop a diaper or something!   The pasta course was good.  Instead of them bringing Parmesan cheese on the side, the entree came with it already atop the pasta -- fine for me, but beware, if you don't want cheese.   Also included with the pasta entree were two fresh garlic bread sticks -- they were very handy in absorbing the excess liquid in the bowl of pasta.  I was sad but not surprised to see that instead of deducting a dollar or two off the price of Meatballs & Spaghetti ($8.99) since I asked for pasta & sauce without the meatballs, I was charged full price.  My bottom line:  Decent food at an OK price & good, friendly service, but neither the casino (I don't gamble) nor the restaurant will be a 'destination' for me -- I came here because I was curious, my curiosity is now satisfied, and I don't see a reason to return.    But if you're a local looking for a small, clean & friendly place to gamble or hang out at the bar & watch a game on TV & while you're here already, you're hungry for some basic food, Sarah's Kitchen will meet your needs.", "Date": "2016-09-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Mari", "ReviewID": "OguZZFI_xLDpQDcryqfyTg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I had a chicken noodle soup and a soda on the side.

Very happy we did.  Very nice re-model of the previous casino/restaurant. Friendly staff, good service, generous portions, good prices. The first time we went I had the hamburger, my boyfriend had the fettuccini and my daughter had the salmon. All of them very good, especially the 1/2 lb burger. The second time we went, I had the prime rib special, my boyfriend had the open face pot roast sandwich, and my daughter had the club sandwich. Again, all of them very good. My only recommendations at this point are (1) use fresh cut fries instead of frozen, and (2) improve the garlic breadsticks on the appetizer menu, or lower their price.", "Date": "2016-08-16", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
