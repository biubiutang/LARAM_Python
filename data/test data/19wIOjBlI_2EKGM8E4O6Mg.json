There was only one lady making sandwiches and it took a while for her to get to us. She apologized for the long wait, hence 2 stars.  And what the hell is Quizno's without a condiment bar?! I need my peppers and other sauces. It was also disappointing that their soda machine lacked pepsi/coke! Who does that?!   I'm sorry Quizno's, honestly, I really like you and missed you in California but please, fix the most pertinent things there!", "Date": "2016-12-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Phil", "ReviewID": "0lZX5JMU6rJ1WqHOvKrfMQ", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Sorry this location fails to offer the level of sandwich making expertise that I've experienced at better locations.    My sandwich was over sauced and put together sloppily.  Maybe the guy was new or the manager just didn't care to offer him adequate training.  But it was my second time going there with subpar quality.  When I got home and opened up the sandwich it was soaked and no way to eat it easily.  I think the owner should take a little more interest in what's going on inside their location.", "Date": "2016-04-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Amanda", "ReviewID": "LUm4uNF5eo0bUmxKpR_sSQ", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Bad service.

The gentleman who works on the weekend is awesome.  He took all the orders and was doing all the work when the language barrier lady was working.  He hid his frustration and worked quickly to make all the customers satisfied.", "Date": "2016-03-05", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Aria", "ReviewID": "CxfYoxg4pm7IYAd6bvSgpg", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Came by a few months ago. Charged me twice for tea and didn't know how to do a refund. She called the manager on her cell phone and refunded me. Two weeks later, the money isn't in my bank account. It wasn't worth coming back and complaining.   Establishment is dirty...I've seen a cobweb or two lurking about.

A coworker and myself came here for lunch (to go), we were the only customers there at that time. The lady making the sandwiches was extremely nice BUT there was difficulty with communication between us (English is not her first language). We were able to make it through and customers started to fill for their lunch and she appeared to be the only one available. When our sandwiches were coming out the oven another Quiznos worker comes through and starts to ring us up, he had difficulty with the coupon code we had and had to call his manager, at this point there are about 8 people in the store (not a big store) and the average time they are MAKING a sandwich is about 10 minutes (if you are 3rd in line, your lunch is shot). Luckily the manager was able to navigate him over the phone, then we gave him our cash and as he opens the cash register the drawer is empty. He ask his coworker about the drawer and she says  in the back , he went in the back to get the money and gave us our change. Our overall time was approximately 30 minutes for two regular sandwiches and no special order. The point I'm trying to make is staff should have a little more pep in their step (especially dealing with people's food during time sensitive matters), they need to make sure there drawers have enough money to give out change, and make sure customers can communicate with staff on tyre front line. I will give them credit for not being mean or disrespectful.", "Date": "2015-09-23", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Pamela", "ReviewID": "m4enNqVjBZzGSTKkN0WA7w", "Overall": "1", "Content": "This place is horrible. I've been in here a few times and every single time, the service is unacceptably slow and the customer service is really lacking. I went in there another time and not a single employee in sight. Wtf? It was in the afternoon so it's not like they were closed.  I could hear people in the back talking. I called out for someone to assist me multiple times. I waited there for 5-10 min for someone to come out and not one person answered me or even bothered to come out. What the hell is up with that?! Hello...I'm about to spend money on your damn food and you ignore a customer?  Ridiculous. The owner needs to find some better employees because these people suck. I ended up leaving and taking my business elsewhere.  UPDATE: I tried calling the store to see if I could get a hold of a manager to speak to.  The phone rang for a while before the phone was finally picked up...the person on the other line didn't say anything.  After I said  Hello?  the person just hung up without a word.  Seriously?  RUDE and UNACCEPTABLE.  How do you expect to run a profitable business with crappy employees like that?", "Date": "2013-10-24", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Brett", "ReviewID": "UdjEaiuYD7oiL7S_VrQniA", "Overall": "1", "Content": "I ordered online and went to go pick it up. When I got there at the time it was scheduled to be done, 3 lady's gave me attitude and told me they just got the order. When I got home and started eating, they made all 3 of the sandwiches wrong.

I've come here before and have had to wait after I had already called my order in. My order is the same every time. I always get 2 chicken carbonara sandwiches. This time around my order was ready right away. The 2 ladies that helped me were friendly and inviting. I even got a 10% discount for living in the area. I will definitely be back.

It smells like sewage. Not all the time but most of the time. The worst thing by far is the Soda fountain. It tastes like dirt. the soda line might be dirty or they are just using crap water. I don't know. They are always out of stuff. The rags they wipe the knives on are dingy. The girls are pretty nice to me but they seem to really not want to be there. When i mentioned how bad the soda in the fountain was they always just shrug. No body tries to rectify this situation. I don't know who owns this place but please clean the place up and fix the soda!!! I really hope they open something up that i can walk to..

Unorganized and VERY unprofessional attitude, poorly managed store- And dirty. We were the only customers- Waited almost 30 min and the sandwiches weren't even done.

I was craving a nice fresh  and I decided to stop at this location as it is close to my home and was on the way.  I was craving a very simple thing.  How do you ruin it??  I just wanted an oven roasted turkey sandwich.  The meat looked like the bottom of the barrel and she didn't even both to separate it or anything.  She just plunked it down.  Asked if I wanted tomatoes and proceeded to place two old rubbery wobbly tomatoes on the sandwich.  I was craving the fresh purple onion and mushrooms I'm used to.  I tell her I want lettuce, mushrooms, and onions.  I see something weird and dark going on my sandwich....I realized that they don't have the fresh sliced mushrooms here...they are those dark rubbery canned ones.  EW What??  The onion was thick slices completely unsuitable for a sandwich.  At least the lettuce seemed fresh- green, and crispy.  Worst sandwich I've had in a long time.  I'm going back to my Quiznos on Craig to get the taste out of my mouth.", "Date": "2011-06-29", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Eddie", "ReviewID": "izVnW6zWXnG9Wg4Wv-GSkA", "Overall": "2", "Content": "The employees are rude.

It is much cleaner than all other reviews make it out to be. All the food was in the proper place, nothing was on the floor, and there was no smell in the air (although a lady walked in after me and mentioned something about a smell, but neither myself nor the two employees could pick up the smell). The employees were helpful, and pleasant, and got my rather complex order done quickly. No rudeness that I could see at all. Also, they offer delivery (and were even offering a $5 coupon for your next delivery when I was in there today).  Some complains though: -The raspberry lemonade was out, and some of the drinks were not working too. The fountain drinks I couldn't care less about but no raspberry lemonade? Unforgivable.  -The employee who made my sandwiches did mess up my first order. But, once he figured out his mistake, he apologized and said he must have misheard me. He then asked if I wanted a new sandwich, but the mistake was minor (regular size as opposed to small size), so I said I didn't care. - No condiment bar. Could be because of the size of the place, but this is the first Quizno's I have ever seen without one. Weird.   All in all, ignore the previous comments, since they are from a few years ago. This place is much cleaner now, and the staff seems much nicer.
