So first off, sign up for their free club. Once you are signed up you earn rewards and they regularly send coupons. If you buy here without at least a 10% off coupon, you are robbing yourself.

I don't think I've walked out spending less than $50 with coupon, and we even just bought a replacement kitchen table there that is awesome when they had their furniture blowout sale (50% off all furniture).

Edge, this place is a playground for those of us who enjoy eclectic kitchenware and furniture, as well as rare treats from around the world.

Here are the highlights  Staff/Service: Really friendly staff who are willing to look things up for you and guide you to find what you are looking around the store. At the time of visit this place was not very busy so the checkout process was fast and efficient.  Wines: This place carries wine from almost every part of the world at an affordable price ($6-$25) and, although we did not get any, I have heard the quality of wines is superb from friends who frequent this place.  Serving ware: This is the only place I have been to that actually carries a section of just 'tastings' size dishes in all sorts of shapes and sizes. If you are looking to have a romantic dinner with your significant other, or want to entertain your closest friends, the 'coolness factor' of these dishes will impress your guests.   Kitchenware: This is where you go to get your kitchen tools, if you want them with a twist! Measuring cups, baking pans and cookie stamps are sold in cool colors and shapes, making them ornamental and functional at the same time.  World foods and treats: I was surprise at the variety and desirability of the products they carry. Stocking foods from different part of the world, you will find anything from spanish serrano ham, to rice paper and nori for sushi, as well as indian curry paste, italian bacon chocolate and truffle oil.

My favorite time to shop here is before a major holiday like Easter or Christmas because they have the best holiday items. I could buy all of my stocking stuffers for Christmas at this store alone.  The World Market Explorer program is the way to go if you shop here with any frequency. For every $200 spent you get $10 in rewards. Additionally, being part of the program gets you coupons and I would say there is an active coupon most times. Coupons are also issued for your birthday through the program. Large furniture purchases count towards the reward program which made my kitchen table purchase an even better deal.

I can still remember my first visit well (cue the blurry, squiggly lines and flashback music). My wife and I stepped into the store and were surprised to discover it filled with all sorts of strange knick-knacks, plates, wind chimes, furniture. It was like some sort of Ikea meets a middle eastern bazaar. Ialmost walked straight out in bewilderment, but my wife somehow managed to drag me in and we made it toward the back of the store and discovered the edible goodies from around the world and, most importantly, from Australia.  I was absolutely thrilled to discover that Cost Plus carries Australian  Bundaberg Ginger Beer  -- a product  and brand ubiquitous in Australia -- complete in its brown glass  stubby  bottles. The label is a little different than what I was used to, featuring a kangaroo, presumably as the most recognisable global signifier screaming  Australia  to Americans, instead of some guy kegging-up brewed drinks, but the taste is the same. Today, my wife (an American convert to the ways of Bundaberg) and I can't drive down Blue Diamond without a stop in to Cost Plus for fresh supplies of Bundaberg. You'll also find Cadbury's chocolate (the real stuff, not the abominable version made by Hershey's that you'll find in supermarket chains), biscuits (that's Commonwealth-speak for  cookies ) from around the globe, an assortment of imported wines, international delights such as Vegemite and Marmite, curry sauces, salsas, crackers, and more.  What prevents such a treasure trove of great memories from home and new international experiences scoring the perfect five stars? Well, firstly, ninety percent of the store is the aforementioned non-edible odds and ends from around the world. Fine, they are international goods - but stuff like this is imported all the time and I've seen it all before. A plate or some knives and forms, or a chair is the same wherever it's from. The other problem is that Cost Plus, in addition to carrying some wonderful stuff that you just can't find elsewhere, tends to pad its shelves with items that are already generally available in the US at grossly inflated prices. I'm sorry guys, but Patak's Curry Sauces aren't exotic and tough to find anymore. My local supermarket sells them. Darrel Lea Licorice (from my home city of Perth, Australia) at $4.00 a bag is too much to pay when target and Glaziers have it at a fraction of that price. Ok, so perhaps somewhere in the wilds of Wisconsin some of these things aren't generally available, but the store could easily adapt to suit each marketplace, surely? I can accept that while the homegoods dominance of this store is one of their main drives -- something I will have to live with and accept as  just not my bag , but when it comes to the food, I would love to see the available-elsewhere-for-much-less chaff cut out so some more excitingly tough to find goodies can fill the resulting free space.", "Date": "2011-12-14", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Luigui", "ReviewID": "2DK2LAok9cCOxe2xGpRTgw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "this place is awesome love the variety of products and also their offers , they use beakn which is pretty awesome everyone should download this app it pushes deals directly to your phone for stores near you.  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beakn.beakn", "Date": "2015-12-08", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Diana", "ReviewID": "sPlnw1H3JPE64gWDG62YEQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I am a lover of all things unique and globally-influenced. So every time I go to World Market, I am in love.   Conveniently located near my favorite Target and In-N-Out, I often times come here to kill time, yet leave with all the things I didn't know I needed. Their selection is amazing - from adorable gift bags to fragrant soap bars to adorable kitchenware. My favorite has to be located all the way in the back of the store: the food aisles. They don't carry the normal fare - everything spanning England to India, I can always find Tahini (most times cheaper than even Wal-Mart) to various Ramune drinks. They also carry the most unique selection of snacks - including Zapp's chips that are insanely addicting.  The best part of World Market would have to be the rewards program. Just for signing up, you receive a 10% off coupon for your next purchase as well as a gift card for your birthday. Just another reason for me to spend both time and money at World market.", "Date": "2011-08-07", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Trina", "ReviewID": "8O89NWoIzTz_WBDYsDLKyg", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I love World Market for the wines, snacks, and kitchen items.

Discount Taken at Register   When you see that, what do you think?  I think,  this is the price, I'll take it to the register and it will be 50% off   You would be wrong about that if you were at this store.  I asked the cashier and she says  Oh, I don't know.  We don't normally do that    I can get the sign for you.   -hesitant-  Oh, okay.   I get the sign and show it to her.    Cashier:  Hmmm, that's interesting. Let me call someone.   She calls up this other woman and she says,  No... it's priced as marked.    So why does it say 'discount taken at register?' What does that mean?    Well we don't take additional off.  These aren't outdoor pillows anyway...   WHAT THE F*CK?!  Do I have DUMBSH*T stamped on my forehead?  Just because the workers are stupid doesn't mean I am for shopping there.  This was truly a disappointing experience because of the magnitude of how much I love Cost Plus.  I seriously don't know where the disconnect was and I'm wondering if we were being singled out.  That pillow was definitely an outdoor pillow and that sign definitely said Discount Taken @Register.  I've shopped enough clearance sales to know what that means.  I'm still very baffled by this experience.  And as much as I want to say I'll never shop here again, I really can't resist.    I love this place but I hate the employees....

Always for their tins of ginger thins. They are just yummy delicious and freaking so addicting.   True story:  When me and Art were first dating and I lived with roommates, they had a tin full and he would always just take 4 or 5 upon every visit and soon enough their full tin became an empty one and it was time for me to move out. LOL!  All jokes aside, this store is pretty fun just to venture through. Items and selections that are vast and from everywhere.   Everyone is always helpful with very customer service orientated attitudes. One visit I knocked over two or three bottles of root beer with my purse. They cleaned it up fast and I steadily apologized but they never made me feel bad about it and assured me that I wasn't the only one that this happened to.   I could easily spend an hour or two in this store just browsing over everything. I could easily spend a whole paycheck here too if allowed.   I recently discovered their coffee and it is hands down some of the best coffee I have ever had in my life. I am in love with their Peruvian whole bean blend.   If you join their member club you get awesome coupons, like $10 off a $30 purchase or more. Twice a year they do a special on their coffees, buy one get one free. And I even have a coupon waiting to be used for a free bag of coffee.   This store has it all. Candy and food from around the world.

Chocolate, candy snacks from other parts of the world. My fave: English Chocolate. Cadbury to be exact.   2. Dining room linens - cloth napkins, runners, table cloths   3. Unique seasonal decor - Halloween, Christmas, Easter. Find cute, unique decor. Great sales the day after the holiday.   4. Everything you need for holiday gift baskets - baskets, filler, wine, etc.   5. Glassware, serveware and other kitchen essentials - Don't come here for your TRUE kitchen essentials like pots/pans/skillets, but they have great unique items like the little rack to hold up my stuffed chili peppers as I smoke them in our Green Egg. And my GIANT glass beverage dispenser that I make large batches of sun tea in and then we just keep it in the fridge. You get the picture.   6. Unique gifts for reasonable prices. Jewelry, bath, candles and holders....   This place is dangerous because it's on my home from work :) Too easy to stop in and find a little  present  for me.
