The S.F. Shrimp Bar and Deli can not get more  old Style.  Shrimp cocktail for $.99 - it does not get better than that. Crab cocktail for $.99. once again. Each comes in an old fashioned ice cream dish with a glop of spicey sauce. Each comes with two packs of genuine saltine crackers.  The really great thing is live piano music for your enjoyment while you are dining.   Old Style  piano music played by older musicians that are glad to have a place for people to enjoy their talent. The deli serves up some typical deli sandwiches with San Francisco names - the  Cable Car  etc, and they have a selection of iced beer and other drinks to go along with the fine shrimp. Totally  Old School  - totally worth your time....", "Date": "2008-01-07", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Steven", "ReviewID": "nCuEXWS8Atd9R-DG-mNB_Q", "Overall": "1", "Content": "FAIL!!!!!

AWESOME!  AWESOME!  The shrimp cocktail is absolutely phenomenal.  It's only $1.99 ($.99 with a player's card) and it's totally worth $99.  The shrimp is fresh and tasty and the sauce is tangy and has a kick to it that only horseradish and wasabi gives.  Complement that with some salty crackers, lemon juice, and you have the best snack in Vegas!  It'll give you enough fuel to win some money on the tables before you go out and eat the $7.99 prime rib.

We sat at the cafe/deli bar, and 2 ladies were seriously handling the whole place. they must have refilled my coffee 8 times in the course of a half hour.  The breakfast is delish and what you would expect.  then the check comes, for two, $12???  yes people.  I gave the lady 30% tip and she was stoked.  Later we walked through the casino and all of the dealers were really friendly, asking you to come sit and play.  And they have $5 craps, which is hard to find on the strip, PALMS minimum is $10.

Do not be intimidated by the long lines. These people are pros and can get people in and out of line fast. They are famous for their delicious shrimp cocktail, which anyone who plays even a little can easily get as a comp. The rest of their menu is pretty good too. I keep telling myself I'm only going to get a sandwich or bowl of chili, but each time I find myself adding a shrimp cocktail to my order. On this visit, the guy making sandwiches looked new since he kept having to look at the menu to make sure he was putting everything he was supposed to on the sandwich. It still turned out to be one of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time.  One thing to note: water is not free here. A cup of water is $1 or you can buy a bottle of water which I think is also $1. The only bottles they have are the same ones you get from the cocktail waitresses; the small bottles. Just splurge and get a soda or a bottle of SOBE. They don't charge that much for them and you're already getting a deal on the food. They even have cheap bottles of beer that go great with the shrimp.  There was a sign up saying that the original shrimp cocktail will soon be $1.99 even for club members, but that members could get 99 cents price for one club point. Not a big deal for me since I usually play a little each visit. One club point is one dollar coin in meaning that if you put a dollar in a slot machine and lose it, you get a point. If you get lucky and turn that dollar into $1000, you still get a point. So worst case scenario you are still just paying the regular $1.99 price.

It may not be the greatest you ever ate, but it certainly is a great value. The sundae  glass is full to the brim with shrimp, not half or 3/4 full of chopped celery or lettuce as with other places.  The shrimp in the $1.99 version are small but far from the tiniest I've seen, and they taste good. The cocktail made with the larger shrimp now costs $3.99, but I choose the little ones. You can get extra cocktail sauce, saltines, Tabasco sauce, and lemon if you like.  Under 21 are not allowed in this shrimp bar/deli in the Golden Gate Casino. Only soft drinks are available, no complimentary water is served, and the water fountain that used to be nearby has been removed.

I have pictures of colossal cocktail-sauce splattered pyramids of  shrimp cups that my friends and I constructed.

I had the 49er and it was delicious. We ordered two more french dips as well. It was great and the price is awesome.   I am not one for shrimp but by the looks of it people love it.
