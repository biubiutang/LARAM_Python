Unlike the normal Chinese fish filet I normally get, that's saut√©ed and smothered in black bean sauce--and not that there's anything wrong with that but--this delicious concoction smashes the standard Chinese options of fish filet. The dry pot comes mixed with red chilies, onions, and mushrooms. The peppercorn opens up your taste buds even more enhancing the flavors. It's Jesus opening the portals of heaven in my mouth, pretty much. A quick tip is to eat it before the crispy crunchiness goes away. After awhile the fish trends to get soft and it just isn't ask yummy.  Other dishes I've enjoyed was the mushroom dish that is cooked in pork fat.  The spicy egg plant didn't disappoint either.", "Date": "2013-05-14", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Rachel", "ReviewID": "oo7V6DZBgwUklsb7w1_GYA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Update 04.14.2011: Been here 3 times in the last 8 days.

Day two in our search for a comparable Yunnan style restaurant here in Vegas. We were led to Jugoo by a fellow Yelper who told us about this  Yunnan  style restaurant yesterday.  Looking at the pics and review from fellow Yelpers, we had to give it a try. Though nowhere as good as Yunnan Garden, IMHO, it is better than J's Noodle which we tried last night. Price-wise, most of the dishes that are under $10 are about $1 more than Yunnan Garden. The letdown is that the dishes here are smaller than Yunnan Garden.  Here is what we ordered:  Dan-Dan (or Tan Tan as Jugoo calls it) Noodles-I have eaten several variations of this noodle in Vegas, SoCal, Taiwan and China. Flavor is light and delicate. My biggest complaint is that for $7.99, I expected a larger portion with a little more meat. I was disappointed that the bowl mine was served in (see my pic) was not as big as another reviewer. This portion is about 75% the size of Yunnan Garden's in terms of total noodle weight and mix-in ingredients and $1 more.  Sliced Fish in Oil (spicy)-Well executed dish.  Very flavorful and consistent with others we have tried. The one thing is that Jugoo cheats on portion size by using Napa Cabbage on the bottom as  filler  material to make the portion of fish appear larger. Again, Yunnan has Jugoo beat in terms of price and quantity of fish.   A-Choy  in Garlic-well executed and full of garlic flavor.  A-Choy  is like spinach where it cooks down to a small size. There was plenty of vegetable in this dish. We really liked this dish.  Mushroom and Pork Stew- Wheres the pork???  I have saved the worst for last! What a big disappointment this dish was. If  I came alone and only ordered the Tan-Tan Noodles and this dish, Jugoo would have received a One Star from me and I hardly hand out One Star. My expectation of a Chinese  Stew  is something that comes out of a clay pot or a large bowl. I envisioned a savory variety of mushrooms with chunks of stewed pork. I was terribly mistaken, my fellow Yelpers. The  stew  was placed in a metal basket kept warm with some Sterno on the bottom. Mushrooms were the long-stringy type (sorry don't know the name-look at my pic for these dark stringy items). The pork was a sad collection of thin strips. The total weight of the pork before cooking had to be less than two ounces; there was hardly any meat. To add insult to injury, Jugoo used green bell peppers and white onions as  fillers  to make the portion appear larger.  Jugoo needs to re-read the definition of  stew.   I am a big fan of beef stew noodles and see they serve it here. But after this meal, I refuse to trek back.  I really wanted to give 2.5 Stars but Yelp doesn't have half-point ratings and a 3 Star is not warranted based on our experience tonight. We feel really cheated by the Mushroom Pork Stew for $11.99 (IIRC) that hardly had any pork and had more green peppers and white onions and also, the Napa filler underneath the fish to make the dish appear  larger.

Upon entering the establishment, I noticed that all of the patrons were Asian....truly a mark of authenticity.  :)  The interior was clean and cosy and service was efficient enough, if lacking in warmth.  Unfortunately, the credit card machine wasn't working that day, which meant we had to do some scrounging to find enough cash to pay the bill.    We ordered the spicy eggplant, the spicy tofu, and the tofu/fish dishes.  All were very tasty and spicy, but not *too* spicy.  I could taste the non-spice elements easily.  My only criticism is that the eggplant dish was a bit on the oily side, but then again, eggplants are the sponges of the veggie family, soaking up whatever they come in contact with!  I would definitely come here again to enjoy some yummy food in a quiet atmosphere close to UNLV.  *FYI: Jugoo is in the same little plaza as the Smashburger on Maryland Parkway.*", "Date": "2012-09-27", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Leslie", "ReviewID": "ha6hLJvV08nCXiidnNwfWw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Although it doesn't have a lot of atmosphere, the food here was amazing and inexpensive for what you get.

Small and uncrowded, as close as In-N-Out and cheaper than Smashburger for lunch. Infinitely better and comparably priced to Panda in the SU.   I've been here twice now and had the following:  Sichuan chopped chicken - comes on a bed of dried chilis, great and peppery. Chicken was a bit bony, though. This is ostensibly their signature and it definitely tastes great and leaves your tongue pleasantly numb.  Sichuan twice-cooked pork - Fantastic lunch special dish, spicy in all the right ways.  Eggplant in spicy garlic sauce - not nearly as hot as the above two dishes, but amazingly savory and visually stunning.

You will most likely see a Maserati parked in front. Just throwin' it out there, it's not a wealthy patron with a taste for Chinese food, but in fact the owner's fancy ride.  Jugoo was  featured  on Dirty Dining. I generally assume places clean up their act after a hit from the health department--and the news--but not this place! While everything seems clean and hygienic, on my most recent visit, I discovered mold in the chili sauce. The tiny plastic container kept on the table was full of mold--in plain view of the customers. Totally a gross discovery. While the food was generally tasty, the rotten chili sauce AFTER the health department was in there is pretty ridiculous.  If they'll put moldy chili sauce on the table, what do you think the food looks like in the back? Reason why spoiled rich kids shouldn't run restaurants.

Their peanuts and tofu is an interesting yummy appetizer, veggie fried rice tastes just like the fried rice I use to eat in Japan, not too strong with soy sauce like Panda Express or too greasy... Full of veggies like I like it. Lunch has a great option of picking one or two food with rice and vegetable spring rolls.

It's hard to find authentic chinese food around the college area, where the average college student thinks authentic chinese food is Panda. It's slightly disheartening because there really isn't enough traffic through here as it deserves.   The owner is really nice, I wouldn't necessarily say the waitress there is the friendliest. She speaks engrish real good so there are definitely lost in translation moments but I would have to say that's part of the authentic experience.   My FAVORITE dish is the Szechwan Lamb. It's to DIE for and their seasonal crab is fabulous. You can't go wrong with anything szechwan you eat here since that's they're specialty.   The eggplant is great, although I might be biased since I'll eat anything eggplant. Any of their veggies are great, IF they have it stocked. In the beginning when they opened, they had a great selection of veggies, but recently the low traffic stops them from keeping a large selection.   I really do recommend it here.
