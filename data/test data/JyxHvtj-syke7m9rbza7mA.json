This place is amazing. I cant wait to go back to vegas so i can eat here again. I was visiting friends in vegas and this is one of their favorite places and im so happy they took me to goyemon. The all you can eat is awesome. Though you must finish all the food you order but its soo good i dont know how anyone could leave food behind. THE PORK BELLY OH MY GODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD drool!! It was the best thing ever, we must have gotten like 4 orders of it. The mingus roll is probably my favorite roll, deep fried spicy tuna, cream cheese and avacado. The seaweed salad was awesome, desserts were awesome. Im actually not a huge fish fan aside from tuna so i cant tell you much about other things. But everyone i was with loved their food. Ive been obsessing ever since i was taken here. The only bad thing is it gets really busy so you might have to wait a while, i do wish the building held more people. But that goes to show how great the food is.", "Date": "2012-06-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Beverly", "ReviewID": "1RmE22hVuP_KOI9OdwXpiQ", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Wait. What the fuck happened here? Everything went downhill.  Maguro: Was old and fishy. Uni: Better than last time. Hotate: Rotten. It was like bitter/sour. Seriously horrible. Ama ebi: Suspect as a motherfucker.  Why the 3 stars still? Poke, tobiko w/quail egg yolk, ikura w/quail egg yolk, hamachi, hirame and a few other nigiri were still pretty good. Oh and we got there right when they opened and yet they were out of salmon collar. Ummmmm WHAAAAA?  Side note: At lunch you can pay the dinner price and get 1 order of ama ebi and 1 order of uni per person. BUUUUUT you can't get all the dinner stuff like the pork belly.

From 11:45 -4:00 they have AYCE for 21.95. It is well worth it , make sure to come hungry! They have a large variety of sushi. We go there at about 2, and it was packed . The hostess was very friendly but we were waiting there about 5 minutes before she greeted us or anything . I think she even greeted other people before us and put them on the waiting list .  Finally she noticed us (even though we were standing right in front of her the whole time ). They have a texting thing where it tells you when you're table is ready , so that's cool . The waiter was ok, he didn't make conversation or anything  , but it might have been because it was full .    We ordered about 8 different types of roles . It was nice that they do half roles. We ordered the Philadelphia role, shrimp tempura, caterpillar, and a lot of other ones and they were all amazing!   All in all our experience was amazing . I just wish the customer service would've been more personable.", "Date": "2015-11-17", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jessica", "ReviewID": "zvvTKLLU6qsqAlOtJIGx3Q", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Goyemon used to be the AYCE place in Vegas 6 years ago. The quality has dropped every year but I keep trying to give them chances. Service is very subpar, slow and unfriendly. The last time I came here (few months ago) was the straw that broke the camels back.  We sat at the sushi bar and asked for all you can eat. We ordered one order of each nigiri we wanted to try and was immediately asked by the young sushi chef if we wanted two orders each. They have the policy of no leftovers or we be charged so we politely said no one order only. He said ok. After we got the orders, half of the nigiris were drenched in sauce and falling apart, one of the fish on the nigiri was also dried on the ends?? We picked 2 of the sushi we were ok with and reordered. The sushi chef checked the order and scoffed  I already made this before ... seriously ?? I didn't even know what to say.  Needless to say we won't ever be back.", "Date": "2016-12-31", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Darius", "ReviewID": "rBo8QZEFGHVsdTANthphzw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Was a big big fan of Yama sushi until I found this place. Yeah it cost a buck more for their AYCE but there's no stupid limitations on the mochi ice cream and green tea ice cream.  There's also no (3 Rounds of Food) like most AYCE sushi places. Was worried that service would be slow but actually the food came out pretty quick. Overall very impressed and will visit again.", "Date": "2013-05-21", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Andrew", "ReviewID": "Jb-rkmeT_Wde7Nj5pkm2hQ", "Overall": "2", "Content": "The death of an all star. Being SoCal natives, Goyemon would be one of our priorities when visiting our favorite Vegas food spots. We remembered Goyemon for their fresh appetizers, awesome desserts, and their amazing nigiri.   A favorite of ours was the grilled pork belly, it would come fresh from the grill with a pleasant crunch on the outside with your first bite but would melt in your mouth from then on. The sushi was the main reason we wanted to come back. From fresh and balanced yellowtail and uni, to their consistent fatty salmon and tuna. Their sushi was unbelievable for an all you can eat location!  It's been about a year since we came to this place and coming back made us miss the Goyemon that once was. The appetizers and desserts came lukewarm, barely any fish came with the rice, and the quality just dropped. Now don't get me wrong, I absolutely love sushi rice and I wouldn't have had a problem if it was made properly. Over cooked sushi rice with too much water, with a less than desirable seasonings that sushi rice needs to have its character. The increase of business and customers may have taken it's toll on one of Vegas' greats. The fish was good, just not enough of it with orders, and if the rice is bad then what the hell can you do about the sushi! Goyemon you were a great friend and we had a great run, but it's time to move on.   Here's an extra star for old times sake. Good luck Goyemon.", "Date": "2016-12-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Rhiannon", "ReviewID": "hnUW-4dukg-5220PL6fryA", "Overall": "3", "Content": "A group of 5 of us went to Goyemon last night with all but one of us never being there before. We were very disappointed in the organization of  first come first serve  which is not entirely true considering one guest came in and said they had a reservation and the wait was half the time for a table. I was there 15 mins before the rest of my group and although there was an open table I was told I had to wait for everyone to get there. Even when everyone did arrive, we still waited to be seat though our table was sitting open in front of us. The hostess said she didn't want to overwhelm the kitchen but I thought still you could seat is and have the waitress take our drink order? We finally were seated after 10 mins. I have never be forced to stand in the way of the door with my table open right in front of me for 25 mins. The food was great but service was not. We were all worried about getting our order in before the hour window of eating because our waitress barely came to our table. At the end of the meal, we waited ten mins for someone to come take our payment and ended up walking up to the hostess stand to do it ourselves. Very disappointed in first impressions this place made. Make sure you make a reservation since it works sometimes and not others. How is that even fair?", "Date": "2013-03-01", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Sophie", "ReviewID": "elVxrYxHwHlF2dCUkjL4NA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Average Service.   good place for AYCE. I don't feel pressured when i eat AYCE here. sushi rice is small, and speed is fair. However tables are small and they are very close to each other. I would not recommend for private dinner. There isn't a personal or private space in between tables even though it is a full-restaurant. The restroom was very clean and unique/pretty.   Sometimes I had to wait but not a long wait. Tried few other dishes other than AYCE and it was pretty good.   For the fast, not the top 10 but overall, very casual but pleasing place to go.   fishes are good but I personally didn't feel freshness to it. (very soft texture for raw fish)   No wasabi inside of sushi.  It could be a decent place to go with comfortable friends or family. Not really a place to empress anyone. It is Very Clean and Neat but no private space nor not a fancy looking place. ;)  Quite as well.", "Date": "2014-01-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Sandy", "ReviewID": "vOaGNhlxcOPoU8zzakaM4Q", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Goyemon? Methinks you mean GoyeNOM. Of all the AYCE sushi houses across town, this is the one I continue to come back to, time and time again, and my sushi cravings are never left in naught after a visit. The staff is friendly and efficient, the service is quick, and the bar/tables never seem to be fighting for the sushi chefs' attention in getting their fish onto the table. They don't toot their horn about being one of the more popular AYCE sushi restaurants but they do have an organized system once they start to run a wait, and will even take down your cell phone number to call you if it gets so long you decide not to wait in the restaurant itself.   I usually try to venture out and try at least one different item I'm there, either on their placemat, printed, or chalkboard menus, but usually the process goes like this because in the end, I'm more than pretty dependable:   1. Appetizer. 2. Nigiri sushi. 3. Some type of 1/2 roll.  4. Uni (sea urchin). 5. Ama-ebi (sweet shrimp)  6. Repeat 2 as many times as necessary before 10. 7. Dessert.  8.

We decided  to go here again to bring a friend who's never tried sushi before.. when getting there we had to wait 45 min. outside to get our table, finally after getting seated waiter asked us for our drinks very rudely.. through out our whole dinner the waiters were giving us bad vibes and after a few orders told us we passed our limit and isn't going to serve us anymore... not only that made us wait 20 min. for our check... I think they should have kept serving us since it's all you can eat and we were waiting anyways but whatevs.. Really good food but service is terrible.", "Date": "2016-08-12", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
