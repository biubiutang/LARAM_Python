I tried the Hawaiian pineapple and salted caramel. Both were really good. I'm generally a sucker for salted caramel, and this one definitely left me impressed.

Here are a few reasons why U-Swirl fits the bill:  1.  They have a really good selection of flavors (I really love the raspberry-pomegranate). 2.  They have a great selection of toppings, and they seem to have more every time we visit. 3.  The price is very reasonable. 4.  They're open late. 5.  They're always very friendly.  I could go on, but I think you get the picture.  If you really like frozen yogurt, this place is definitely worth checking out.", "Date": "2011-08-05", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Y010295", "ReviewID": "h_b_gkQkEOvXB4_0uLXTEA", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Overpriced. $6 for a cup of ice cream and some toppings?  Last time I went they were out of chocolate.  1 star for good frozen yogurt. However NOT worth the price.

I have tried just about every frozen yogurt store in Las Vegas : Yogurt-land, Menchies, Yogels, TCBY, Red Mango, Yofresco, Cherry on Top etc so I really know yogurt. However, I realized now that what people really like from frozen yogurt places is yogurt that tastes like ice cream which means creamy and no tartness. In my book, yogurt should have a certain tartness to it. However, U-Swirl does offer a wide variety of flavors and toppings to choose from so you are not limited to the tarts or the creamy flavors. The seating area is roomy and the decor is much better than Yogurtland. I also think they charge a little bit more per ounce than Yogurtland but I'm not sure since some of them have also raised their prices. Gotta love the self-serve!", "Date": "2011-06-21", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Sondra", "ReviewID": "XGWxD5k5AmKMDZIISvl-rA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "We had never been to a U-Swirl before and received a tour from the staff; very helpful.

I originally had plans to goto carvel up the street but the owner closes at 8 p.m. (oh well his loss).  So this was the next nearest place and I love frozen yogurt and this was my first visit here too. So I arrive at about 8:15 p.m. on a Friday night  I walked in, the place is very nice, spacious, clean, I loved how you could select and mix all the different flavors and stuff and the price was fine too. They had 5 people already sitting outside eating and another 10 inside in line. So I'm thinkin this place is gonna be good.  I tried 3 flavors there (peanut butter, cake batter, and cookies and cream). As I was walking back to the car, I tried the cake batter first. Their yogurt was very creamy and smooth, but something was missing. I tried the next flavor and then my 3rd flavor ALL 3 were COMPLETELY FLAVORLESS. I was very disappointed. I figured ok 1 type might be lacking flavor but all 3???    Sorry I will never go back.", "Date": "2012-04-21", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Kellie", "ReviewID": "Tt5rx3cmJ8w4B3S-pKhUsg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "This location is my fav,then the w. charleston@ hualapai.
