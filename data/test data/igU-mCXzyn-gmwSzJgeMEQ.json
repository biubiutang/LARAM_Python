Everything is fresh and prepared in front of you. Not an original idea, but rare to find in a pizza joint. Decor is too bland; obviously they wanted you to come in and out quickly, hence the short time to get your pizza ready, which is not a bad thing if you are in a hurry. But it feels more like a sandwich place than a pizza place. Staff I dealt with were very friendly.Not the place to expect the best quality pizza, but for the price and speed of preparation, you have to let go of some other qualities I guess. Still, it is a very decent tasting pizza, and thin enough so you don't feel like you are eating too much (but this is also how they save in costs). Atmosphere is not that great; you feel more like in a hospital cafeteria than in an Italian eatery.

I ordered online around 3:55pm, my order was not ready until 4:30. Online time for it to be ready was at 4:15. Also, they did not bother calling me to tell me that one of my orders was not available. Common courtesy is to let your customer know something is not available and to ask if there's something else we would like. But no, none of that. The worker said we'll get refunded by the company they work with online. Hopefully I see that in 2-3 day, if not I paid $10 for nothing.   We also ordered the wings and on special instructions we wrote if they can put the sauce on the side because we have kids that will be eating it. (We ordered mango habenero). They didn't put it on the side; what's the point of having special instructions if you don't look it over. At least let your customer know it can't be done then we can ask for something else. Communication is key.    The pizza was really good, my family liked it and the kids liked it. It's sad that people who work for a good place don't care about it. Three workers and one could of easily made our experience much better.   We ordered four pizzas (one cancelled by the pizza kitchen) and an order of wings came out to $42 it was pricey, but wanted to give it a try.

Pick  your own crust, sauce, cheese, meat, and veggies, and your creation will be out in three minutes flat, for $8 (+reasonable upcharges for certain specialty options like goat cheese, prosciutto, etc). Staff are friendly and I like how the decor is modern and casual without a corporate feel. Grab a scoop of gelato for dessert if you're still hungry afterward.  The reason this spot gets an extra star than average for me is the quality toppings- they have everything from arugula and avocado to roasted red peppers, artichoke, and fresh cilantro and basil. Even better: the staff don't skimp on the toppings, everything is evenly applied.   NOTE: The wheat crust is thicker than most  thin  crusts and after cooking is still a touch soft and chewy instead of crispy- I like it, but realize it's not what others are expecting.

Create your own unlimited pizza for only $8! It's a nice medium size that two people can easily share, even 3. Same concept as Pieology and tastes somewhat similar. My advice is to get half red sauce and half pesto. The pesto tastes soooo good! Not a perfect 5 stars because their chicken tasted funky- that fatty chewy kind and they ran out of mushrooms. The sweet siracha chicken is a must try. Unlimitied toppings and different cheeses and veggies make it a great value. They also have gluten free options.

With all the custom built with unlimited toppings popping up here in the valley,  Pizza Kitchen is a welcome addition.   I liked their toppings of house cheese blend, grilled zucchini (loved this), arugula, fresh basil, sun-dried tomatoes and meatballs. The ham, sausage and ricotta didn't quite do it for me though. Their red sauce had a nice acidity to it which I enjoyed.   FYI - For those that like spice, they do have Sriracha flavored meats (ie,  chicken and I think sausage? ) which do not have at the other custom built places.   The whole wheat crust was quite nice -  more doughy than the usual thinner cracker crust. Loved how the edges are hand pulled at the end to give it a nicer crust.   The pizza is baked on a conveyor belt vs. wood-fired. The benefit is you get a more consistent crust. But the down side is you miss the smokiness of a wood-fired product.   I also noticed that they now offer custom build salads for $7.99 now which I think I try next time I drop by.  This place does a pretty good custom built pizza and does offer some toppings that others do not have. The crust is different enough to distinguish it from its competitors.

Co$t = Cheap! 2 custom pizza for $15!    Now. The bad.  The wait. This place is, literally, the  Subway of pizzas.  You choose all your toppings as you walk the line.  After I ordered my pizza, my boyfriend didn't have a chance to make his order til the 3 ladies after us (in line) made theirs. There was a miscommunication on who helps who in the line.  I guess the employee helping me had to make my BF's pizza versus my BF being next in line. But, the employee helping me wasn't able to start til he was done with mines.  Which makes sense.  But I can see a back log of clients waiting.  Maybe if they had one person in each station the wait time wouldn't be as bad --- someone in charge of dough and cheese, another in meats, and last in doing veggies.

If the worker is also short, we have a hard time hearing each other lol  Aside from that, it's all pros for me. Their workers always have upbeat or very eager to help attitudes, which goes a long way in my book. The quality of their toppings is much more consistent and flavorful than Pieology. I never have to ask  can you please put some more of (topping)?  because they give a generous amount of everything you ask for. I love ordering the traditional crust with both house blend cheese and ricotta, then I'll add pepperoni, regular sausage, spicy sriracha sausage, bacon, mushrooms, roasted garlic and capers. They really won me over with the capers. I'm sure most people get the capers for their make-your-own salads, but I love capers as an anchovies or olives salty-substitute.

Not alot of personality on the walls, Pieology at least has some fun quotes to read while you wait for your pizza.  First, they don't hand toss their dough, so the crust was just okay. They were pre-done, maybe even frozen?? Didn't see a dough press so might be the case and the resulting cardboard crust. Sauce, several options to choose from, the marinara was okay.  Here are the two big issues and why I will not waste my money by going back: 1. They dont have a pizza oven, they have something similar to Quiznos - a conveyor style rack that  heats  the pizza and melts the cheese. How can you possibly expect good pizza without a real oven???  2.  Unlimited toppings . I wanted pepperoni, mushroom, peppers and jalapenos. I got 7 pepperoni (even after asking for more please), exactly six mushrooms, scant amount of sliced peppers and five jalapenos.  How disappointing. I didn't even get a bite of each topping on each slice. Wrong place to be skimpy guys, wrong place. Especially when you advertise  unlimited .
