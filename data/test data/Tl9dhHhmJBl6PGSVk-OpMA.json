Customer service needs some help, two polite employees does not make up for ten rude ones unfortunately. It's a nightmare going inside and the time it's dirty. I prefer the drive-thru but I can sit there for ever saying hello and no one responds or I'll get a response to wait, not a please at all!!! That makes me kinda angry. I know some would not care but I've worked customer service before and it's not polite when you add a rude tone and attitude on top!!!  I don't make it to breakfast often. It's been a long time since I've ordered an Egg McMuffin, so I indulged. I paid $1.19 drink upgrade for a large orange juice and I got a watered down juice so I went they the drive-thru and the lady was rude like I was the picky customer, I only want what I pay for and a little dash of politeness since they get paid for it!!!", "Date": "2014-07-21", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Kelly", "ReviewID": "ou91Nnwav-UjtKMIEXZBTw", "Overall": "1", "Content": "So get a load of this.

At night the staff is rude and the place dirty.
