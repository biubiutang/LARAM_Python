I am fan of Bar Rescue show been too two other bars that been on the show. Unfortunately for Hammer & Ales felt like this bar is my least favorite Rescue out of the three I been too first hand. Not that it was all bad the things that did stand out for me was like outside of the building with the art work and like the well lit sign that can see from the road. It located in industry area one that only business other then strip club down the road open at night. So make sure look for the sign or else drive right by it. I like all the widescreen televisions that inside the bar couple of them nice size and perfect chill watch sports (last night case primetime Olympic coverage) drink beers talk stories with friends. They have separate room that has a pool table and dart board. Not sure if they do the world beer stamp card from the show. I like the chalkboard world map on the wall. The bartender she was friendly, on it came too our beers ask us before close too empty, and she has this positive upbeat energy vibe. Really in the end Hammer & Ales still dive bar for me. As for Dive bars nothing that really stood out for me thankfully bartender and hanging out with roommate made the most of first time visit. I know they serve food but after the food coma was in from CMYE last thing on my mind so never asked the bartender for the menu, She never asked us if wanted one. They do have nice selection of beers on tap too choose from although last night felt like looking at the taps few that was out.    The area is not exactly the most safe area and coming out of the bar feel like looking over my shoulder something bad going too happen. Really in the bar if not gambling on the machines, sports fan watching games, or playing pool or darts no excitement come here too Hammer & Ales. Maybe the food but get back too you on that one. I might come back too check out the food. I think would rather stick too my normal dive bars.", "Date": "2014-02-12", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Keith", "ReviewID": "t8oeTR54s-J6cfDbUkR4SA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "A friend of mine is a regular here and I make it to the hammer maybe once a month.

Stopped in here on a late Friday afternoon to check it out. They have 24 tap handles but at least 10 of them were out. Seems a bit odd to start the weekend with that many dead handles but the bartender laughed it off how many were out. Asked what one of the handles were and they had to go read it to see.  Something raspberry  was the response. It was a Founders Rübæus. They did give me a free taste which is always nice. Never saw an actual beer list but the tap handles I could see were less than impressive. Didn't bother to try the food especially given the looks of the place and didn't see anyone else eating either. I love a good dive bar especially if they have some great craft beer.

It was about 2am, we had been out all evening, and it was time to grub and have a few last drinks.  Apparently, this spot JUST opened up, but it was going off.  What a cool crowd, including the owner who was very accommodating.  We had drinks at the bar, chicken fingers, wings, fries, and one of the best Philly cheesesteak sandwiches I have ever tasted, including the ones I had in Philadelphia.  Since the place is new, it is clean and fresh looking.  Nice polished concrete floors, a new pool table, a handful of large flat screen televisions, and my personal favorite, the internet jukebox.  Video poker machines are on the way because they had signs on the bar in the future machine locations.  I would normally drop a star because the place is a little out of the way, but I had such a good time that the stars remain in tact.  Besides, this bar isn't trying to be anything more than it is...a low-key neighborhood hangout that happens to draw a crowd from other parts of the city.  A great hangout, not a club.  However, there was no shortage of people getting down the night we were there.

I'm not sure what kind of crowd this place attracts, but they weren't there last night.  Thankfully, my cousins arrived shortly after. We had one round of drinks and left. The only reason we went there is because one of my cousins knows the bartender. She seemed cool at first, but got annoying after a while.

I spent a few minutes standing in front of the bar trying to determine which of the many beers to choose from (Only had two out of stock). The beer wasn't all that cold and had a large head of foam but tasted pretty darn good.   Their gaming room with electronic golf and a few other old fashion bar games went unused the entire time we were there. Seems like a complete waste of space to me. I'd think they could make a better use of that area.  The door to the men's restroom refused to stay closed. Anyone walking the hallway could see the guy standing at the Urinal so I used the stall.

Our immediate exit seemed inevitable...right? We ended up throwing a $20 in the machines, staying for about an hour, and having a pretty good time at the Hammer & Ales. Our bartender Lisa was friendly as hell, and a welcome breath of fresh Las Vegas air. Drinks were on the house while we were gambling, which we didn't expect off-strip (SCORE!!). We heard so much about the food, but the oven was down and options were limited. Lisa graciously hooked us up with some fries, rings, and marvelous housemade ranch sauce which I'd likely consider drinking from a straw if I was in the constraints of my own home! Had some great convo with Lisa and a local Vegasan, gambled a bit, and even got to see  Barbie  turn in a handwritten application exclaiming her ability to pass a drug test! Yay Barbie! Probably had to be there for that, but trust me...only in Vegas. Judging a book by its cover, we probably would've ran from this place after a few minutes.

Don't be fooled by the decor and how the food is presented the food is excellent. The food was poorly displayed and had me nervous but the taste was great. Drinks are inexpensive and the bar wasnt full. ill be back because the owners seemed to genuinely care that i was being served properly", "Date": "2014-05-27", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Johnny", "ReviewID": "gfyyxni6bKjOK9-xeQh79w", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I stumbled onto this joint with a friend of mine as we were looking for a cheap place to grab a beer and some food.  The sign out front read  2 dollar beers  and  PUB- GRUB- PLAY .  We were from out of town so we didn't know the area but we couldn't have had better luck.  We had gone to the  LAX  night club at the Luxor hotel and casino the night before and were not pleased.   So we were looking for a bar where we could actually carry a conversation without yelling.  We were the only ones in the place when we first got there as it was earlier in the night, but a small crowd showed up as the night went on.  The bar tender recommended either the Philly cheesesteak, or the open face ribeye.   We both ordered the ribeye for a cool 10 bucks and were thoroughly amazed.  I would have easily paid $25-30 for this thing!  It was the best steak I had in half a year.  I also got a chance to sample the fries, and the chicken strips which were also amazing.  I can't say enough about the hospitality of these people.   They were friendly, experienced and accommodating.  We had planned on having dinner, a couple beers and a few games of pool and spending an hour or two in this place.  The hospitality and quality of the establishment kept us from leaving, and before we knew it we had been there for 6 hours.    I'll just say that if I lived in the area I would definitely frequent this place.  I spent 3 days and 2 nights in Vegas and my best memory of it was this bar.  Once you get tired of losing your money in the casinos and paying ridiculous prices for weak drinks come here and start really enjoying yourself. When you walk into  The Hammer  you are living the champagne lifestyle on the beer bottle budget.", "Date": "2010-04-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Tim", "ReviewID": "vGXkfXlLf-nSIOslQeurMw", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Hammer & Ales on Russell rd is a great place to stop by for a beer and service is wonderful. I drive by coming to & from work and always wanted to stop in.  I was greeted by a much friendly bartender and caught her has she was leaving only to be greeted by her relief. Well, service got even better. Two young bartenders vey friendly and attentive!   I noticed they do have have a kitchen but haven't eaten here, yet.   I will come back again.

Unfortunately, it seemed to me that a lot of the improvements made to the bar can be chalked up to TV magic. Sure the bar clearly went through some changes for the better, but it seemed to look a whole lot more flattering on my television screen. The bathroom was a dump. Several beers were out of stock. From the outside, the place just doesn't appear to be a bar despite the large mural painted on the outside wall by the entrance.  The place is a dive bar, I get that, but there's just not much too it. The bartender was pleasant enough and was on top of refilling my glass, but she would not stop mentioning what time her shift ended. It was as though her customers were getting in between her and her freedom from working behind the bar. Other than that I did not get a chance to sample any of the food and may go back to do so and perhaps update this review.", "Date": "2014-03-17", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Christina", "ReviewID": "mAAeFsDTV4qiV-wJuHt3RA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "It's wonderfully divey and you never know what you're going to get from night to night, but that's part of the charm here!
