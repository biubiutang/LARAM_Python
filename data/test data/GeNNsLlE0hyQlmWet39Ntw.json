A group of us were staying at a house in Vegas for a bachelor party.  We hired him to make a meal for us after being by the pool all day, before going out at night.  The chef was fun, accommodating in every way, and put out some amazing food.  I 100% recommend him to anyone staying at a home in Vegas.  You have a much better experience, and actually end up saving money, by going this route.    Thumbs up!", "Date": "2014-07-16", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Stacy", "ReviewID": "v0eSwUuHvLbV76Z0QmdUSg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "We found Chef Robert through his personal website, and hired him to provide meals for my parents (in their 70s) during a time of health challenges. We live in California, and wanted to make sure my parents were getting the food and nutrition they needed, since we couldn't be there to help them directly. Robert was the best!  He crafted a customized meal plan for them that incorporated all their favorites, plus introduced them to healthier, organic ingredients. They loved the service, and couldn't stop talking about how wonderful and delicious the food was. With Robert's approach, my dad was able to quickly and easily get a meal on the table in only a few minutes-- and this is a man that formerly only made sandwiches. Amazing. Beyond the great food, Robert won my family over with his personable and kind nature, and commitment to service. We couldn't be happier, and highly recommend Chef Robert to anyone looking for a customized, healthy food delivery program. Thank you, Chef!", "Date": "2014-04-11", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Minnie", "ReviewID": "smLmjkHdT2BiyRvPQUcjTg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I recently had to have a very invasive surgery and as a result would not be able to cook. Chef Robert and Maranda were life savers. Had the delicious lunch and dinners delivered for one month. (One week at a time)  Well worth it. Fast and easy preparation. 10 minutes and done. I would highly recommend Real Organic Chef.  Great great service.", "Date": "2015-05-15", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Cat", "ReviewID": "FvgsjREvcJek3tkqTlsQ4w", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Chef Robert is amazing! The service was a huge help to me after having our first baby. We had lunches and dinners prepared for us weekly. The easy of reheating each delicious premade organic meal was a dream. In less then 10 mins a complete meal was from frig to plate... Especially wonderful when you have a newborn to care for. Each week Chef Robert and Maranda would delivery the weeks worth of meals.  Real Organic Chef is a great service!!! I recommend it time and again!!", "Date": "2013-03-30", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jeff", "ReviewID": "S45Zw2od1IhVzjv_1ivhsA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I've been with Real Organic Chef Inc for about 2 years now. Short answer. AWESOME!  More in depth review. It's been quite the journey fine tuning ''my menu'' with Chef Robert thease past couple of years. I was conteplating a personal chef for a year or 2 at this point when my friend Todd told about this service he had been using for about 6 months at the time so I called, had a consultation, went though all my likes and dislikes and a shortly there after had a meal plan lined up for me, now it's been through many incarnations, I kept on trying different variations to try and eat as healthy as possible within my taste preferences (besides when I go out to eat, which I still like to do, all bets are off sometimes ha) at first it was like this is pretty good but it needs to be tweaked just a tad, I was probably a little difficult at first, I don't like seafood, and am very particular about certain foods so there was a learning curve, then it just kept getting better and better as time went on through my particular tastes and suggestions along with Chef Robs unlimited creativity and great passion for what he does, he takes it as a welcome challenge and feeds off it! Pun intended.  Not everything is 100% perfect all the time, meaning out of hundreds of meals (most of them different so u don't get sick of the same thing, but if u want the same, thats an option too) once in awhile one might not come out as u expected, not often at all, but no fret, Chef is more then happy to make you another meal to make it right, even throw in some things for you to try that he may think u will like for free, so there is really no issue at all. Customer service is fantastic, he and his wife Miranda are very personable and are really excited and proud of their service which is delivered to your house or if more convenient at another location they are flexible. even if you have to go on vacation and do not need service, give enough notice and they will accomadate you and the food? Oh yeaaaa, Great stuff!  There are endless possibilities. You have any questions, concerns, ideas, you are in a very comforatble atmosphere and it's sooooo convenient, vacuum sealed bags, boil water for 5 minutes, made fresh the day of delivery and your off.   Soo if you are looking for great tasting endless variety of food from Mexican, Thai, seafood, soups,meats ect, and a fair price and eat as healthy (or not) as u want then you will be pleased with Real Organic Chef, oh yea Chef Robert can tell u the Veggies that are in season/available that are organic on a weekly basis as well.  Enough of my rambling, thanks for reading. I'm going to finish my meal now ha!", "Date": "2014-12-08", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
