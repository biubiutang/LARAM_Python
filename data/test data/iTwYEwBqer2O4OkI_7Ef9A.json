Two minutes later, we left.   I wish I could tell you how the food was, but I would have had to have had my order taken by somebody. There was a table of two girls, probably in their late teens, that were also just sitting there, also without drinks, waiting for somebody to come wait on them.

It's a basic burger done really well.  My friends who had the other burgers and the battered shrimp dinner also enjoyed their food a lot.

The onion rings had a light beer batter and the zucchini had a denser coating.  Both are fantastic if you're in a fried kind of mood, but very filling.

I spent a summer working in Boulder City back in 1995 and we ate here regularly.  I don't make it back that frequently, but the nostalgia factor is tough to resist when I'm in the neighborhood. I'm a big fan of the burgers...they probably aren't the best in the Las Vegas metro, but they are big and juicy and a great value.  They offer a couple different topping options including bacon, jalapenos, and green chiles.  The fries are fairly mediocre, but that mediocrity is eclipsed by the wonderful fry sauce and seasoning salt available on the table.  The milkshakes are also enjoyable...thick enough you need to eat with a spoon. Although service can be a little hit or miss depending on how slammed the restaurant is (and believe me, it can get crazy in here), the waitresses are generally very friendly and are doing the best they can.

We couldn't exactly figure out who our waitress actually was because the person that took our order was different then the person who delivered it and even different then the person who dropped the check off. We did notice the waitress liked to spend a lot of time around the kitchen area playing with their hair.........which is so gross in a restaurant and just chit chatting. It took 10 min to get mustard for my gross sandwich all because I couldn't get anyone's attention.

The burgers were delicious as well as the fries. The fry sauce didn't taste like other fry sauce that I've had but it was still good. It was more runny than what I'm used to and had a slight vinegar taste. Still good. Our check with tip was right at $40. Here's my only complaint about this place...why do the girls wear those tiny little tank tops?! I have noticed that almost all little eateries like this in Boulder City have their workers wear these shirts! WHY?! If you have good food, why do you need to have boobs hanging out all over? I'm a chick and was distracted my the busty girls running around the place. There was one server that I seriously couldn't stop staring at. She was young and very large chested. The tank top was SO low! Like inappropriate low. I don't understand why they can't have the girls wear a womens tee shirt? It would look so much better. I get it, sex sells but it shouldn't be the focus of your hamburger joint and that's what I took away from this place more than what I thought about the food.", "Date": "2017-01-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jacque", "ReviewID": "e7N75m_wk-3O7B8Dvzmoag", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Finally!

Combine that with a nice fresh bun and a dollop of mayo and you've got as good as a frozen burger can get (I'm assuming they are cooking frozen patties).  The fries are worth a try as well.

Their menu has something for everyone. They offer you classic sandwiches, salads and of course burgers! Some of my favorites to order from here are the Pit Burger Combo which comes with 1/3lb burger, frys, and a soda all for $8.95! You can even add a domestic beer for  $0.70 or a import for $1.25. Sounds like the perfect combo to me. I also really like the Chef Salad. It's huge and comes loaded with ham, turkey, swiss and american cheese. If you feel like a sandwich the classic Club sandwich is always a great choice. I must mention that when ordering frys or any other fried goodies they give you a squirt bottle of Ranch and Fry Sauce!! So awesome!!!!

My wife and I have been coming to this restaurant for 5 or so years, and now we have a hard time getting burgers anywhere else in the country. My wife and I met long-distance (I lived in Phoenix, she lived in Henderson) and whenever I came to town, the first thing we ate was Pitstop.  Food is legit! But first, let me tell your about the place. Pitstop (for our family) feels like an extension of home. The place is always clean, music (and now Flat Screens) are on, decorated with all kinds of Baseball swag, very comfortable. We are ALWAYS greeted, welcomed, seated as quickly as possible and we always feel as though someone is keeping an eye out just to make sure things are going the way we wanted. It has gotten to the point that Jodi (hope I spelled her name right) knows our drink orders as soon as we walk in the door and has a good guess what we might be ordering that night! Mind you, we aren't affluent people by any means, just regular peeps. She takes the time to strike up a conversation to see how you've been and what you've been up to, offers suggestions about new things they're trying in the kitchen and offers a level of sincerity about helping you. You only get service like this from people who care. The entire crew works as a team to serve the entire restaurant, and it makes you feel as though everyone is there to help you.  Okay I'm rambling, let's get to business. I come for burgers and onion rings, so I can't give a first hand account about the rest of the menu. But if you're a carnivore like me, you're in for exactly what you want. Dial up the amount of meat you want from a delicious and juicy 1/4lb Dam Burger all the way up to the 1lb monster burger. I've tackled the monster before.. It's massive, grab some napkins. Add on your favorite toppings and make it just the way you want (green chiles is a must for me though I wish they were more spicy). Fries are good but onion rings are my fave here.. Big, golden, crispy and hot.  My regular order which has been consistently juicy, flavorful and filling  Double Pit Burger Combo w/ Onion Rings Add Bacon Add Green Chile Add Pepper Jack Cheese  If you've driven past Pitstop Burger in the past, you've done yourself a disservice. My wife and I can get a burger anywhere, but there is only one burger spot that we are willing to drive 20miles to get to..

Cons: restaurant so dirty that I threw up in the parking lot.  The burgers are fried rather than grilled, so it's a different flavor than most other restaurant hamburgers.

The French fry portions are very generous.  Cons: FILTHY restaurant.  I am not kidding.  Everything was sticky and greasy.  Dirty tables just sit there until staff have time to clear them, and I was uncomfortable drinking from my drink glass after I saw our server clean a dirty table and then bring a refill.  Fortunately, the other con came into place - poor service.  Our server wasn't rude, but not very attentive.  They don't have enough staff to keep up with the volume of customers.  So I didn't have to worry about a refill because I only got one, and then gave up.  There is no reason for this place to have table service.  It would be much better suited with a order at the counter setup with a drink station, like Jason's Deli or something.  However, the bathroom was disgusting.  It was a tiny single unisex stall covered in used toilet paper.  I decided just to wash my hands and skip the science experiment toilet, but there were no paper towels or soap.  The worst part was overhearing the staff and kitchen from the bathroom.  I just used hand sanitizer, paid my check, and walked to my car.

I had the DAM burger special, which is 1/4 pound beef patty, fries, and a drink for about $6.50.  I added mushrooms and Swiss cheese, which were .50 each extra.  I was disappointed that the mushrooms were not fresh, but canned--blech.  The fries weren't bad, but I wish I had ordered onion rings instead.  The good news is that the service was very attentive, even though it was busy and there were customers waiting for a table.  Overall, it wasn't a bad meal, but just okay.

Bad a bup (restroom is for one and clean FYI). But seriously, they are right by the busy intersection of BC. Its quite busy at dinner time too. Locals love the place as much as the rest of us. It's a very tiny place but they serve big tastes. We are part of a Jeep group. (Being Asian I drive a Toyota in there. Reliability damnit!) After mudding through the flat beds near Nelson we came here for lunch. Everyone ordered the Pit Burger. Some had beers for lunch, which they have. For us light weights, the finest Coke on tap was ok. Free refills here FYI. The burger is cooked right and the fries are generous and crunchy. Honestly, I can eat two. With the distance it takes to get here, I probably should've. The burger is not greasy and it has a nice char to it (weird guy in a plastic King outfit need not apply here). I skip the special sauce which is usually Thousand Island (where did they get that name? Seriously, that's a lot of islands. And why did they go around making salad dressing, in an island? As perplexing as why there are Chickens in the Sea to me.) Tidbit, you can ask and get the onions grilled as well. The chili fries tastes awesome and it's served on a plate with plenty of chili and meat. You have to eat it with a fork. This place has been here for as long as I can remember. There used to be another burger place that was just as good but served theirs differently. Starburger but alas they went Supernova and no longer here (it's replacement is not it, trust me) There used to be a 50s diner here that served food from the 50s and had decor from back then, it's gone too. But still standing here, is the American burger plain and simple @the Pit Stop. Service is always fast and friendly.

They have fry sauce here. FRY SAUCE people!!!! Do you know what this is? It is the best, creamy, tasty concoction to dip everything in!!!!! I haven't found another fry sauce that even pales in comparison to theirs (not even in Utah! Gasp). Their french fries come in their own basket and they man are plentiful. These suckers are so tasty because they put some sort of Lawry's seasoning on them. Scrumptious!  Pit Stop's burgers are simple and that's what makes them delicious. The patties are well-seasoned and juicy, the buns light and toasty w/American cheese and whatever else you fancy. A cheeseburger, a huge basket of fries and a soft drink is less than $6. You can't even get out of McDonald's for that cheap! Pit Stop has a variety of other foods that they offer - fish & chips (outstanding), hot dogs, grilled cheese sandwiches, salads, milkshakes, etc....very Americana and the prices are right.

The first thing that surprised me was I thought they were a basic fast food burger stand but instead they are a sit down restaurant with waitress service- no counter. I didn't want to eat in but luckily they do take out service.   I ordered the house special Pit Stop burger with cheddar cheese with fries and drink and sat down at a table to wait for the order.  I see a lot of people in reviews here knocking the place as shabby and run down. Well, yeah it is a bit well worn, but it's a burger joint- a local dive. What do you want? I think it has it's charm and while shabby, it is definitely not what I'd call dirty. I think I saw in some review below a girl said it was so dirty she had to throw up in the parking lot???? Seriously???? Come on now!  OK, to the food- The burger was surprisingly good. The beef had a rich taste and some crisp crusty bits from frying on a flat top. Nice melted cheddar and a mild thousand island burger sauce added to the overall good experience. I would definitely recommend the burger as above average IMO. The fries were average middle of the road quality but were a nice hefty serving of them. As for the fry sauce talked about, I really didn't like it. Too loose and whatever that spice is in it, I just didn't dig it.  Price- My meal was just about $8.75 or close to that I think, but since you have waitress service even with a to-go order I felt obligated to tip the additional $1.25 bringing it to an even $10. Kinda pricey.  One more note on the restaurant staff- there were about half a dozen waitresses on duty and all of them seemed to be young and rather hot girl next door types.
