No let me say that again, I LOVE this place. They are always SO fast, everyone is SO NICE. Pizza is piping hot, not to mention fun desserts! Even when they are SLAMMED which is MOST of the time, they never make excuses, they just put on a smile and get the pizzas out the door! I never thought our neighborhood Pizza Hut would be our  go to  place for dinner, but as FAST AS THEY ARE! They deliver, before my order is complete!! Thanks Pizza Hut and all the crew working this location. It's a shitty spot but ALL OF YOU MAKE IT WORK! And for that, I just want to say thanks :) we got a pot of gold in the ghetto", "Date": "2016-06-18", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jack", "ReviewID": "rm-NbU35dupZLW97aF2qkQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Well if I would have reviewed this restaurant about two months ago it would have been a 2.  I have somebody in my house that has issues with tomato sauce and so when we order our pizzas one always has to be without sauce.  In the past management didn't care because they usually got it wrong.  Luckily Pizza Hut now has a pizza dippers which has no sauce.  We ordered it the first day it was out and the cooks weren't use to it so made it with sauce.  Luckily we did a chicken alfredo with it and my son was able to eat that instead of the pizza.  I called the manager and he understood and gave us a credit for the pizza and we were able to order it again a few days later.  This time it was made right.  The manager seemed really apologetic and that he cared.  Not the way it used to be.  So you might want to give this location another chance.", "Date": "2015-05-10", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "James", "ReviewID": "PueDVVwzADFT5CdOqZV-Aw", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Horrible problem resolution skills by the manager of this pizza hut. That had an issue where we did not get everything we paid for and they refused to make it good. Our thin crust pizza was horribly under cooked and was stuck to the bottom of the box. I don't give them my business anymore.", "Date": "2015-11-28", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Alan", "ReviewID": "3iFEjEsrC_Seb1o3GfYOFQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Stayed in today, and decided on pizza.  After checking a few, I chose Pizza Hut for delivery. Order on line, and got the pizza in the time they said. It was hot and prepared nicely. The delivery driver was very nice. Will do this again.

I was honestly very nice and very patient the entire time. I have no clue why this was done to me. they couldn't have known I was black so I don't believe it was racially motivated. and I know this review won't do much, if anything, at all. but i thought I'd at least let others know of the crap going on over there. Will never order from them again. it's unfortunate because I do love pizza hut. the delivery man was a sweet guy. I just don't understand how this happened or why it happened.", "Date": "2016-01-22", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Joanna", "ReviewID": "fkuuWWWTqfPgNIPGghh7GQ", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Calling for delivery for 2 medium pizza and the lady I was talking to was rude and stuff like trying to hang up on me other than saying  would that be all for you?

Everything was good till this homeless guy came in sat down right behind us.  He was talking to himself loud put all his stuff on the table.  I'm pretty sure manager saw him sitting there but she didn't say anything.  I was very disappointed about her action & definitely will not go for dine in there anymore.   But she changed channel to football game on tv so I'll give 5 star for that.  Lol", "Date": "2016-01-10", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
