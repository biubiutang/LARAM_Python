The parking lot is too small. The entrance is setup strangely and you've got to wade past a bunch of crappy displays that make you feel like you're going through a maze to get in and out. The deli is a stripped down affair with 1/4 of what you want, a lot of crap you don't, and backed up with surly service behind the counter. The store itself is dingy, dirty, and pathetically stocked. And for the privilege of enduring a crappy store like this I get to pay the highest food prices of any chain in Southern Nevada to boot. Ugh! And I won't even get started on the expired orange and tangerine juices that made several people very sick and made for a rough weekend. In short I'm surprised Albertsons keeps a store like this open. I'm not a fan of Boulder City to begin with, I can't wait for the future Interstate 11 to bypass the dump with only 2 exits to connect to it. (And that's 1 too many IMHO). And stores like this do not improve my impression of the place not one bit. When Albertsons closes ALL of their Southern Nevada stores in the coming years you can look to the Boulder City location to understand why.   1 Star is being overly generous. The best thing that can happen to this store will come at the business end of a Caterpillar bulldozer and hopefully sooner rather than later.", "Date": "2012-07-23", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Melissa", "ReviewID": "l7ddsbpYOOPAPciQaT2mJA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Better than most Albertsons in nearby Henderson. The employees are genuine and the selection is usually good, with a clearance section that usually has quite a few items.

I usually stop by to grab a few items before I hit up the lake or go hiking. The deli staff are pretty nice folks. The place is well organized , they have a pretty large clearance area.

First off it's like the only grocery store that is in close range of anything, so pretty much it was my only option. Prices seemed to be the same as all of the other Albertsons that I've been to. Only difference with this place was that the shelves seemed like they were lacking in some areas. Which areas, I couldn't tell you. Just seemed a little bit more run down than I'm used to. I'm sure they get a lot of business since (like i said) it's the only place in town pretty much. But overall, I got what I needed and left in a reasonable amount of time. The people who worked there were very nice. One thing that really stood out to me is that when I was at the cash register checking out, I let them know I would also be needing a bag of ice. One of the workers then got the bag for me and put it in my cart (I'm used to having to get it myself). So I found that to be very polite and courteous of them. All in all I think it could be worse, but then again it could have been a lot better. Not quite 2 stars, not quite 3. Let's just say 2.5 in my book. I would go there again, but just because it's the only place in town pretty much.", "Date": "2012-10-03", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "5lycjn_EKl2YIZ7FCzUjSw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "I have no idea why the average rating for this store is a two.

And there are just too darned many people shopping there now ... it's a train wreck.  Parking and departing are downright dangerous with all the people walking every which way and all the cars coming and going.  And I was NOT happy 2 years ago when they took the self-checkouts away.  Yesterday I found that the USB ATM in the store is so old that it doesn't even accept deposits.  It's a round trip of 25 miles to the nearest USB bank/ATM that does ... I just sent USB a comment on that one.  One tricky little device that Albertsons has begun is the shelf labeling with TINY print of the so-called  specials  ... where you may or may not have to buy 4 or 10 of an item to get the price.  To a 75yo guy with crummy vision, this is maddening.  Now for the store entrance: it's like driving in Istanbul, two blind corners in a row after entering, with a great chance of bumping into someone LEAVING the store.  Madness!  This store is now a DISASTER, and BC desperately needs ANOTHER STORE (Walmart Neighborhood Market or Smiths, please!).  And now for the #1 gripe BY FAR: take a little walk to the far back right corner of the store to the fish and meat counter (just past the pharmacy).  What's that smell?  Are we in Yellowstone Park?  Is there a very sick woman lying on the floor?  What's that smell?  Gag me with a spoon!  Call the Health Department and force Albertsons to GET IT FIXED!!!", "Date": "2016-07-07", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jerold", "ReviewID": "gqXiyrnOeZC6x0MdKhvH-A", "Overall": "1", "Content": "While the prices are better than haggans. The service is horrible. I went to buy eggs and this trashy employee was bent over showing her butt Crack and a huge thong. I'm sorry but pull up your pants and be professional. The staff here is rude and unprofessional. The only things this store  has going for it is decent prices and janet in the pharmacy.

The Vons closed due to another story of corporate corruption of which Albertsons was a part.  Since then, shelves are not properly stocked or faced, expired items everywhere, light burned out, and floors dirty.  I usually drive down the hill to Smiths now.

I went in to buy a patio set and he made it quick an easy.  actually all of the male employees were great ! There were about 7 guys that helped me out to my car.  I didnt have to do any lifting.

I miss having a second grocery store and I especially miss Vons. Albertsons has become constantly crowded and busy and way overpriced. I used to know all the checkers but now they have like 175 employees I don't recognize anyone. If you only have to run in for a couple things I would recommend going late at night so you don't have to wait in line forever. If you have a whole weeks a shopping to do, do yourself a favor and go to Henderson..

Don't like to have to buy a pallet of wine to get a price that still higher than Total Wine in Henderson. still love the self checkout.I'm lucky I get the bulk of my groceries at the Smith's store on Valley Verde in Henderson or Costco. great prices and service. People are actually genuinely friendly . I feel sorry for those in boulder city with no transportation and have to buy albertsons or vons ( which I won't rate because you can't give negative stars). I still shop here when I need one or two items. prices much higher than over the hill. Updated 5/24 /14. RECENTLY REMOVED SELF CHECK OUT. Will never shop there again. ..", "Date": "2013-07-07", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
