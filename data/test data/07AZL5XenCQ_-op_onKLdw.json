Had not eaten at  BLT before but we were staying at Paris next door and  decided to try it.  We were seated promptly and our server appeared in a few minutes.  He was very knowledgeable and helpful.  Complementary fois gras was served with crostini. It was very good. They also served popovers which were the highlight of our meal.   We both ordered the Waygu filet mignon, mine medium rare and hers rare.  We also ordered stuffed mushrooms and green beans.  The stuffed mushrooms were good but very heavily salted.  When the steaks arrived, each was not cooked as we ordered.  Hers was medium and mine medium well.  They were topped with an herb mix which was also too heavily salted.  We were going to a show and it had taken quite a long time for the meal to arrive so we did not complain about the salt but did ask my daughter's steak to be redone.  I just ate the one I had ordered.  The service had dropped off after the food came and we didn't get water glasses refilled.  No one came near to ask.  My steak was very dry.  It took some time for the other steak to appear.  Overall, we didn't enjoy the meal here nearly as much as other steak houses we have been to in Vegas.   The chef can't cook Waygu filet as ordered and pretty much destroyed it.  I wouldn't go there again and don't recommend it at all.", "Date": "2016-01-20", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Donna", "ReviewID": "EBr7PrCSb9Fv9GSZb_4YeQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "I have to say that this place was absolutely phenomenal! I would go back there in a heartbeat. I'm posting this a little late; my husband and I went there for dinner about 1 month ago at the end of July. This was our honeymoon and I am so happy that we got to experience this restaurant.  Firstly, the hostess was very very sweet and asked us if we were celebrating anything special. I said that it was our honeymoon and they treated us like gold. They seem to be very nice accommodating and customer friendly anyway so I have no doubt that they would have true that's just the same had it not been a special occasion.  The restaurant was very clean and decorated in a very modern and contemporary atmosphere. Our waiter was fabulous, explaining everything on the menu, going over all of the specials in cocktails explaining everything in detail. He was wonderful!   Everything we ordered was awesome. To start, we got complimentary duck pate, which I've never had before but it was really good! After this course, they provided complimentary cheese popovers, which were again amazing. They also provided small recipe cards so you can make the pop overs at home if you wish. I thought this was a very nice touch and very classy. My husband and I shared the Porterhouse  for two, got a few sides, and also three dipping sauces to try. Again everything was delicious!  We picked everything clean!  Additionally, the cocktails were very good. My only criticism is that each cocktail was $14 each which, I know is Vegas, but still, a little expensive.  Naturally, we had to splurge on dessert and we weren't disappointed. So rich and delicious, each I believe were only $10, which seemed like a steal compared to everything else, haha.   Howeve, my favorite part throughout the whole experience was watching the staff members throughout the evening. There seem to be multiple managers walking around, checking on customers, in addition to the incredibly efficient wait staff. I was very impressed that multiple folks came by to ask us how our meal was, how experience was, and knew that it was our honeymoon and congratulated us.  It made us feel really special and made the experience very personalized.  They also gave us a complimentary dessert which were too small chocolate bites because they knew it was our honeymoon and my husband's birthday was the day before. It was cute, small, and had a lit candle in it which was very nice.  We absolutely loved it and I wish that there was one near off in Boston!

The popovers were outstanding.  Flaky, Cheesy, Salty Deliciousness.  We shared the Bone In Rib-eye which took almost 45 minutes to be served, and it was undercooked.  Although it was very flavorful, it was not a good cut of meat.  I am not sure if I have ever seen a tendon in the middle of a rib-eye, but this one had a large one running through it.  It was overall a fatty piece of steak.  The Bone In at Joe's is far superior for the same price.  The service was slow even though there were many servers present.

We were staying at Flamingo and didn't want to travel far, so this worked.  We called in the morning, they mentioned they were pretty open, but made reservations for 8pm anyway.    The decor was more modern than I thought it would be, and brighter than I thought.  And the tables were slightly close together--we could perfectly hear our neighbor's conversations, and noticed every time they stared our direction.  A little more privacy would've been nice.  We eventually were also neighbored next to a boisterous bachelor party, but, whatever, it's Vegas.    After trying to get some insider info from our server, Leon, (see below) we decided on starting with raw oysters and we each ordered the 22oz bone in ribeye with a side each of Mac and cheese and truffle mashed potatoes.  We also ordered a dirty martini and a glass of Riesling. We were pleasantly surprised at the beautiful popovers we had and the amuse bouche  (a lovely, light duck pate with croutons) was so so good.  All the food was tasty, and cooked to perfection.  I ordered my steak 'black and blue' and it was exactly that.  The herbed butter on top was heavenly, and I would've loved more of it.  The steak itself was tender, with good flavor, nice marbling, thick cut, lovely crust... And the truffle mash was the highlight of our night.    For dessert we ordered the strawberry rhubarb cheesecake, and they stuck a candle in it for my birthday.  They also brought out two bonus brownie bits, that were standard. Boyfriend loved the cheesecake.   Our server, Leon, was perfectly nice and tried his best to be accommodating.  A couple of things-- we had mentioned this was our first steakhouse and asked some questions about the meat and he gave me a recommendation based on my tastes.  I also asked about the sides, and such...He gave me text-book information about the items, but honestly I just wanted a  go with [this item], it's seriously the bomb  or  you really don't want to miss out on this .  I left feeling I should've tried other things instead of what I ordered.  He went above and beyond when he brought me a taste of the wine I was thinking of ordering (and thank goodness he did, I hated the wine) and asked the kitchen if they could allow us to order just half a dozen of raw little neck clams (they were running low so the kitchen said no, we'd have to order the whole seafood tower) and thanked us for coming in.  But service all in all was very very slow.  Lulls in the meal were long and plentiful.  The whole meal was pushing 2 hours, and it was definitely mostly waiting time.    On the whole, the place is good, the food is worth a visit, but I'm not sure I'd come back.  Having to spend that much on a meal ($250 tax and tip included), I expected at tad bit more, but was a little disappointed.", "Date": "2016-09-04", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Eric", "ReviewID": "kpB3EGSyUFvn07sJK1-CBA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "We really enjoyed this place.

Our table for four wasn't quite ready for us, so we grabbed a drink at the bar. Our bartender happily suggested one of their signature cocktails with basil and watermelon. It was mighty refreshing, slightly sweet and herbaceaous. I enjoyed it, but the overall crowd pleaser was their take on the Long Island Iced Tea. It was refreshing, with some bite. Just what I like in a cocktail. In addition to cocktails, they offer top shelf liquors, bottled beers and varied selection of wine. Prices range $8-$15 for most libations.  Once seated we were given an amuse bouche of pate and jelly, with toasts. It was a lovely presentation, but a bit rich. Later came the popovers that just might have made BLT famous. These monsters are light and airy, simply perfect with a pat of butter and pinch of salt. The egginess couldn't help but remind our group of Yorkshire pudding.  The menu offers seafood and poultry, but you must try the steaks ($20-$60). They are aged (mostly dry), broiled and finished with herb butter. We had the filet and bone in NY strip. Both had beautiful crust and were cooked to a perfect medium rare. More juicy and tender than you might expect. They offer sauces to accompany the steaks for a few bucks, but we agreed we liked the steaks on their own best. Though, the horseradish that came with the three mustards was the favorite. We also had the 2 pound lobster which had a lovely presentation, great flavor, it was delicate and tender; the trouble was there wasn't enough meat to it.  The sides ($10-$13) were heavy on taters, you could have them six different ways. We opted to try a variety, we shared onion rings, potato skins, hen of the woods mushroom, and caramelized brussels sprouts. We found the sides, with the exception of the brussels sprouts - now, those were delicious - to be the weakest link of the meal. We thought they were too basic, we expected a twist that would elevate your traditional onion ring or potato skin, but nope they fell flat.  Dessert ($10) was really decadent! Portions are large and good for sharing. We had the crepe souffle, warm chocolate tart, peanut butter chocolate mousse and mini doughnuts. The passion fruit sauce on the crepe would've been better served as a drizzle. It was cloying and overpowering. The tart was more of a lava cake, but the pistachio ice cream was wonderful. The PB and chocolate mousse was rich and heavenly, though, I didn't care for the banana ice cream pairing. The doughnuts were light and similar to churros and I really enjoyed the coffee ice cream.  Overall, it was a great meal. The staff, while warm and welcoming, still have kinks to work out, but in time they should be operating a well run ship.

I wasn't expecting much from this steakhouse, tucked away in Bally's without a celebrity chef or known brand. But they really, really deliver. Cozy atmosphere, excellently executed menu, top-notch service.  POPOVERS: A fun version of the usual free bread service, these are delightfully airy with a crisp exterior. They're served with fresh Vermont butter and salt, and you even receive a small card with the recipe. I'll just come back instead of trying to make these myself. DUCK LIVER PATE: A complimentary dish served to every table, this was served in a small jam jar with two small slices of bread. I like how the richness of the pate was balanced with the sweet jelly on top. An indulgent start to the meal that raised my expectations for the kitchen.  STEAK TARTARE: It's not the best version I've had on the Strip, but it is delicious! A traditional preparation, plated with nicely crisp country bread, this is a great starter if you don't mind a  steak app before a steak dinner. BURRATA: A heap of deliciously creamy yet mild mozzarella, surrounded with toy box tomatoes and accented with basil seed vinaigrette and basil leaves. Save your popovers to devour this. Add a touch of the salt from the butter, too. ROASTED BEETS: Everyone has this on their menu these days, but BLT's comes as a salad with apple, french green beans, gorgonzola, and walnuts. BF called this the best version he's had. BONE-IN RIB EYE: This was heaven. Cooked and served in cast-iron, it has a thick crust and was cooked perfectly to medium-rare. The fatty bites right next to the bone are the best part, and this is served with the marrow, a tempura-fried onion ring, and a whole roasted garlic bulb. Easily one of the best steaks I've had, and at a shareable 22oz and a wallet-friendly price. After taking the first bite, BF and I knew we would be coming back. GRILLED LOBSTER: This is a $20 supplemental, and well worth it. Generous portion, served atop the steak, sweet and tender. I'm usually not much of a lobster fan, but I'm glad we decided to add this on. TRUFFLE MASHED POTATOES: Despite all the rave reviews, this didn't go over so well with us. We like truffle-accented dishes, and we like potatoes, but something about this dish just didn't work. Good, smooth texture but it's the only thing on the table we didn't finish. MANCHEGO WHITE GRITS: Wow. After leaving the south, it's been difficult to find great grits. Well, here they are, perfectly accented with a tasty green chile relish. I couldn't have asked for better. BROWNIE BITES: We were too full to order an actual dessert, but were presented with this complimentary plate, and it's perfectly sized for just a hint of sweetness after the meal.   I feel like I can't fully express what a great find this is- apparently others are catching on, because the dining room was packed on a casual Wednesday evening. I recommend making a reservation if you plan to drop in during dinner hours.   Snag a Groupon while they're still up ($100 credit for $70), the discount is appealing but totally unnecessary to make me return- the food alone is enough to make this a strong and frequent recommendation when seeking a nice steak dinner on the Strip.", "Date": "2015-08-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Teele", "ReviewID": "ztX6tyLTqRrN3V6rMdcWPw", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Stopped by again on our yearly trip to Las Vegas and ended up having Tony again for a waiter!

The manager, Casey, checked on us several times and we wanted for nothing throughout our meal.  As for the meal itself, we enjoyed warm cheese popovers, oysters on the half shell, a well-executed tuna poke and charcuterie. My medium-rare porterhouse steak was seared, broiled and properly rested. Dessert was decent, but I didn't consider it to be on par with the rest of the excellent meal.

We had the lobster bisque, crab cake, and an heirloom tomato, arugula, and prosciutto caprese salad to start. I believe the lobster bisque and caprese are seasonal items because they were on a different menu. I was very impressed with each item.   My filet mignon was probably the best steak I've ever had. I ordered it medium well, and it was juicy and tender inside with a crispy seasoned exterior. I ordered the blue cheese sauce in case my steak was dry or tasteless, but I didn't really need it aside from the fact that it was so yummy.  We also ordered the creamed spinach and mashed potato sides, which were perfect accompaniments to our steak.   I was most impressed with the dessert.

At least my 2nd choice was available.   Popovers arrived at the table.  The Popovers were great and they were accompanied by the recipe.   All the steaks come a la carte. So you will need to order some separate sides. We shared Truffle mashed, Brussels sprouts and stuffed mushroom caps.  Truffle mashed was good, the other two were fine.

I am knocking it down a star because it seemed that every wine we ordered was out f stock. Kind of a random occurrence because they had a really extensive list that could cater to anyone's taste. I do have to say that the General Manager apologized profusely each time he said they were out of a particular wine, but he did suggest another wine which was actually a great pairing to what we ordered and suited both of our tastes. Kudos for him for knowing his stuff! Also knocking down a star because once we were seated it took 10-15 minutes for our server to come over. Once he introduced himself, he was very helpful and friendly.   The amuse bouche was a pate... I don't remember what kind, but have you ever seen someone who doesn't eat meat break out a little redneck and try to lick the bowl clean? It was incredible. Wow. I want to get in the bowl of that deliciousness.   We had the tuna tartare for our appetizer. I always order this fan favorite if I see it on the menu and I was not disappointed in their take on this dish. Try this if you like tuna!  My other half had the NY Strip and ordered it medium rare. This restaurant nails it on the head for cooking their steaks perfectly! Although he claims that he wishes he ordered it rare instead, it was thoroughly enjoyed. I had a bite and found it a tad too salty, but what can you expect from an aged steak? And in my opinion he should have ordered the steak rare (or blue, yes they do that here yay!), it is his own dang fault.  I had the Grilled Branzino. Having never tried this before, I was intimidated. I don't know why. This meal completely surpassed my expectations. It was incredible. I was finished with my fish before he could finish his steak!  On the side we ordered the mac-n-cheese. Overall it was good, but I have to say it wasn't mixed well so a few bites were extremely salty. The truffle mashed potatoes were everything I hoped and dreamed. I would order both again and just make sure to stir thoroughly next time.

I told him I already got the humor from the first guy so he backed down, though I still had to justify for 2 minutes on why I needed a box.

I asked what they had for reds and he turned around without a word grabbed a menu then slapped it in front of me.  So far weird but the signature BLT drink with the dried orange was so good and I thought things would get better when we got a table.  When they brought us to our table we passed by several very open areas scattered with people comfortably enjoying their meals.  We were sat against the wall next to the kitchen sandwiched between 4 other tables maybe 18 inches away from each other if we were lucky.  My husband told me next day that that actually put him in bad mood which is funny because I was also really bothered by that but I kept it to myself thinking it would get better.  It keeps getting worse.  Waitress Margo I Think was nice enough but she didn't care.  She didn't seem to care about anything nor have much knowledge about anything.  She kinda blew off each question I asked her like I asked if the tabouleh was really minty and she said oh no it's not minty at all and I felt like I had to inform her that traditionally it had mint in it it seemed to me like she played it off as if she already knew but I believe she was clueless because it was like ya ya I don't care uh huh how can I get out  of here.  It made me so uncomfortable that I started apologizing that I asked a couple questions.  Then my husband makes 3 attempts to be friendly and ask her how this or that is and she clearly didn't care and couldn't wait to get out of there.  I said to him each time she doesn't care.  He got mad at me because I kept saying that but he can't help himself to keep trying which is killing me to watch.  So he tries to tell her the pop overs aren't that great to me they are very eggie not very cheesy tasting at all they are like chocolate eclair without the chocolate.  She says ok and walks away.  Maybe she didn't hear him?  She acted like she did.  She spoke English as first language.  My husband did say there were so many people unnecessarily packed next to each other that he had trouble hearing me.  My husband suggested I get the scallops with tabouleh because it's a chalkboard special of night.  I got 2 and 1/2 scallops not really big but on small side of large with maybe 1/2 cup tabouleh.  Scallops were over cooked at least half of the deformed 1/2 scallop was and the tabouleh was just ok the lobster bisque was very tasty but by the time I got to the 2 pieces of lobster claw they were saltier than I would have expected, chewy and definitely over cooked.  The wedge salad was pretty average not something you would expect to come out of Hell's Kitchen.  1 bite of that salad and the waitresses attitude and I just wanted to leave.  She makes mistake of dropping off the 2.6 scallops for the special price of $45 and asks me how things are as I am staring at my plate in Complete disbelief.  Had she been nice and engaged or acted like she cared I might not have been so upset but I pretty much lost it on her and told her that she ruined our night with her attitude and on top of that I said are you serious?

Three of us had the 10 oz filet and one had the bone in strip, all with different levels of  doneness.   Every single steak was cooked to perfection and so tender!  I am super picky about how my beef is prepared.  Recently graduated from well done to medium well, knowing that most chefs usually do a medium when preparing my order.  It was medium well, and we all were amazed at how simply flavorful it was.  There are several different choices for sauces.  We either ordered the red wine sauce or the peppercorn sauce.  I loved the peppercorn sauce.  Thought it wes the perfect compliment.  To start I had the butternut squash soup which was delicious.  The sommelier picked out a beautiful Malbec - a 2013 Luca.  She was awesome, and took her time answering questions and doing some teaching.  She was really sweet!  As everything is a la cart, we each ordered a different side: loaded baked potato, mac and cheese, potato skins, and green beans. Everyone was very happy wtth their choices.  We were too full for dessert, unfortuately. Let's talk about our waiter, ok?  Leon was freaking AMAZING!  He helped make the meal even better.  Attentive without being overbearing.  My best friend and 2 daughters were with me, and he put up with us in great form, joining in on our fun while we were still keeping it classy.  He bought my 2 daughters shots, the birthday girl a cute little dessert (tiny brownie bites) with a candle, and brought the 4 of us each a glass of champagne.  You would be so lucky to be seated in his section.  He truly looked like he was enjoying every minute of his job with all his tables.

We ended up corking it and bringing it back to the hotel since we knew if we finished it, we would indeed be finished!", "Date": "2016-12-21", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ruth", "ReviewID": "mEPqhQKbKWKpcFwXWAW9YA", "Overall": "2", "Content": "I have never been so disappointed by what used to be our go to steakhouse in Las Vegas.  I decided I wanted to go back to BLT for my birthday dinner this past Tuesday; we have been to BLT three times this past year alone.  I don't know if the recent CET bankruptcy has anything to do with it, but the service and food have taken a huge downturn.  The service was poor - we were left sitting for extended periods of time with absolutely zero attention from anyone.  This was unusual as in all of our past visits, the waiters and bussers were all over the tables and made you feel very special.  As CET Diamond, we received the complimentary appetizers, which have definitely been downsized since this past May.  My special birthday dinner was the Maine Lobster entree - WOW - can't believe they called that an entree.  The shells were huge, but the lobster meat was MAYBE the size of 2 crawfish.  My husband's short ribs (his go to at BLT) were also downsized and extremely fatty.  The side dishes were a joke; $11 for green beans (which was a personal portion), his mashed potatoes were served in a ramiken (about 3/4 cup) for $11!    I gave the extra star for the popovers - which remained as they were.  Well BLT, you ruined it for me!  At least I know this steakhouse will no longer be in the mix of restaurants to chose from!", "Date": "2015-10-25", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Sally", "ReviewID": "FGkhlA_pmIXhHfQsnpIUdg", "Overall": "5", "Content": "The best meal we had in Las Vegas. We live in a vegetarian household, so a chance to have steak when we are away is a real treat. The whole experience was first rate, from creative cocktails to the prime rib itself.

Several unique choices and the expected steak house standbys all executed to absolute perfection. Great restaurant hidden in a hotel in dire need of remodeling. We had a party of 5 and tried everything we could. Zero complaints. One nice feature of it being stuffed in the back of Ballys is that you can get a table almost anytime with little to no wait.", "Date": "2014-10-06", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "Iqeoz00NXuFZpsA5tMA_5w", "Overall": "1", "Content": "A steakhouse can not deliver quality steak, which is unacceptable.  Part of the steak was made carbonized, barely edible.   Although the manager took the steak from the check, but the dinner and the whole night were ruined.  Just so disappointed.", "Date": "2014-11-11", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
