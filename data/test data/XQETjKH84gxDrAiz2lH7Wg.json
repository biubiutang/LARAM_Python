I was like that crazy girl who stalks her prey on the internet before finally committing to find/meet the person, or in this case restaurant, in real life. I watched Mind of a Chef. I bought the cook books. I follow on Instagram. So last time I was in Vegas and found out they opened a location it became clear that the time had come. First the line was long. Meh, I've been to Disneyland I don't care. But then when I finally got to order I felt really rushed and flustered. Maybe it was just butterflies. But then It took FOREVER for them to deal up some soft serve with cereal sprinkled on and it was good but not great. It was SO much sugar. And I know sugar. I live for sugar. I eat candy for breakfast. I put maple syrup on almost anything. But there was something that was just not there for me. And the same could be said for the cookies and milk shake we ordered. One of the cookies was good. But the other two were down right bleh. And on top of everything, this ish is expensive. If I'm going to spend that much and wait that long then that monkey better get to dancin.", "Date": "2017-01-18", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "8eaT3qzrK70wlW1msSh2-w", "Overall": "4", "Content": "A great place for a quick, post-dinner dessert and coffee cravings.  Get the cookies ($3 each. Compost, corn, and blueberry are top notch), get the soft-serve ($6.95? Get the crack pie with the crunch topping), and pretty much anything really. Of course prices are gonna be at the high side because, duh, you're at the Cosmo. Service was friendly and quick.   The only downside is the lack of seating. So I just grabbed a seat by the bar adjacent to Eggslut.

I've been copying Christina Tosi's cookie and dessert recipes since 2010 but never made it to any of the NYC locations. When the Las Vegas milk bar was announced, I thought about working there. So when the long anticipated opening finally came during a bit of free time in my day, I drove right over to the Strip.  I quickly located milk bar just a few steps from the parking garage elevators, east side second floor. Not having to walk through a casino was appreciated. What I found was a simple walk up counter and friendly cashiers ready to take my order. I would have preferred a store to browse while deciding on my selections, but this was my first peek at the full menu and I felt indecisive. The pie selection was limited to crack when I was hoping for candy bar or other varieties.  Milk quakes are a Vegas exclusive and the strawberry and corn flavor was an easy choice after being recommended by two staff members. The workers are so welcoming and friendly! As soon as I paid for my order and stepped towards the pick up window, I was offered a crack pie soft serve to try because it was  extra.  I wasn't too impressed by its subtle flavor but I enjoyed the crunchy cornflake coating. The milk quake, underwhelming in presentation, was a tasty treat. As I dug in with my wooden stick I uncovered surprises like soft pieces of strawberry jelly and large chunks of corn cookies. I've never tasted anything quite like it. It did remind me of my experiences eating halo-halo, minus the shaved ice, beans, and overall flavor profile. I'm sure the wooden sticks are trying to be nostalgic rather than remind you of the doctors office, but at least halo-halo is served with a real spoon.  The only other item I purchased was a corn cookie. The texture was soft and chewy but the flavor was similar to dense cornbread. Target sells milk bar cookie mixes and they taste so much better warm out of the oven, making it even less appealing to spend $3 for a packaged cookie. I have no complaints about price point because it's inside the Cosmopolitan and matches its neighboring $12 carrot juice and $5 biscuit snack bars.", "Date": "2017-01-01", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Mirit", "ReviewID": "JbCd3Bwgn7f8tItTldgNHQ", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Very disappointing. Service, to begin with, is mediocre. The prices are exorbitant!!! A 6  chocolate malt cake is $56... and the cake is heavy, dry, too sweet, and not worth more than $20! We also ordered a milkshake.. they are all about 12 ounces.. and the chocolate malt cake milk shake was $9.50. It was actually yummy, but way too heavy as well. The Milk bar in NY is 'wayyyyyyyyyyyyy' better!  It is located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan next to Momofuku, which should open soon.  Two stars is because the price does not justify, even on the higher end, the amount paid for the quality of the product received. It is simply wasted money one is ready to throw away. We will not be going back. There are way better options on the strip...

First of all, the line is almost always really long. You can expect to wait probably at least 15-20 minutes in line. Not sure about the prices in New York but this was probably one of the priciest ice cream places I've been to. A serving of soft-serve is $6 and the milkshakes go from $7-$9 for the basic ones ($12 for alcoholic ones). The serving size of a milkshare is about the size of a Grande cup at Starbucks so it wasn't even that much either.   I got the cereal milk milkshake and I  actually couldn't even finish it because of the taste. The one good thing was that it wasn't overly sweet but it started tasting  worse and worse with every sip. It also felt very heavy for some reason. If you're in Vegas and you want something refreshing to drink/eat, don't come to Milk. The taste, price and line is just not worth it.", "Date": "2017-01-17", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Franklin", "ReviewID": "qP4HqjznCu0c8YalhTQQBg", "Overall": "3", "Content": "My girl was hyped up to come and try their Crack Pie.

I enjoyed it thoroughly. The intentionally less-sweet milky soft serve paired with the delicately, sweet homemade cornflakes was a perfect combination. It truly tasted like the end of a bowl of cereal, without the sogginess. I was also happy to hear that they make their own cornflakes in-house. Obviously, after tasting them, it is apparent.  Although the ice cream was delicious, it seemed a bit expensive. I would definitely go back and try more of their menu items and adjust my star rating accordingly. But for now, 3 stars for the hodge-podge, almost thrown together store front and the prices. Maybe, after being in their location for a while, it will get cleaner and more organized.   Perhaps the hype built up my expectations a bit more, so I was slightly let down. But they just opened, give them a chance.

I hope this place fails. Not for the tastes of what my group had, most of which was respectable, but rather for the obscene and unwarranted price point. It's the first time I've found pricing to be offensive, even as an Apple products' loyalist. It just doesn't make sense, despite the location and not even for the overall quality.  $6.50+tax and they ask for a tip for tossing you a pre-packaged microscopic crack pie, delivered to you abjectly in a cardboard box that belies the actual size of your wedge. I had a flashback to one of those trashy McDonald's apple pies that come in those flashy red plastic containers. I began to utter,  what's this?  to the cashier as she thrust it at me, but stopped when I saw the label, my eyes widening, my heart deflating.   At least at McDonald's they put it on a tray and give you a place to sit and enjoy their classy dining.   Not at Milk. At Milk you're supposed to stand around awkwardly amidst the mass of people jostling for either the escalator or a slutEgg, looking like a chump for having bought some egregiously priced grab-n-go miniscule.   $6.50+ for this sliver that is smaller than my small Trump hands, with an embarrassing un-artsy smudge of confectioner's sugar? NO. My friends got the $12 (TWELVE!) booze shakes, and I felt sorry for them. The presentation was trash: a cheap plastic dome top, about the size of a Starbucks tall. Know where you can get a beautifully crafted booze shake 3x the size? Two shops down at Holsteins.  Not coming back. I'm secure enough with myself I don't need the name-notoriety of this place to feel like I'm succeeding in life for having bought something here. As an accomplished amateur baker, my dreams for this place after the impressive marketing they did pre-opening were shot. Total implode.

A bit of play on words but c'mon. Let me put this on the table or rather no table sice Milk Bar is standing room only, but I am not fearful to pay top dollar for the food or drink experience. So when I slid my Credit card through the reader for a $12 Crack Pie Milk Quake, I was expecting a bit more than a plastic cup with a wooden spoon and a milk quake that was not even filled to the top of such said plastic cup.   The group stood around in front taking pics and looking at what was placed upon us. We waited and waited because the order of one of our Sin City Foodie group members got forgotten. We located seats within the Chandeliers, ate and discussed... Oh and waited for our friend with his forgotten order.  I would give this a Two Star but I gave it that extra shiny star because the Crack Pie was really good. Just the Crack Pie. The ice cream in my milk quake was average at best and the presentation was not the least bit sexy.  Honestly, I would rather pay a few more dollars for an enormous sexy sundae at another on The Strip location, which will remain nameless. Although most Sin City Foodies will know where it is. Okay starts with an  S  and ends with a  3 .  I'm all about the full food experience from beginning to end using all the senses I have.

I believe Milk Bar originates from NYC and is a progenitor of this cereal trend along with Kith, and is a welcome addition to the Cosmopolitan. Like everything else at the Cosmopolitan, it's also overpriced. That's not to say it isn't good. Milk Bar does have some very solid items, from their cookies to their milkshakes, but I've got to say that it doesn't fulfill the craving. When you want a milkshake, you want a heavy, completely guilty item that makes you feel like you've made a terrible mistake but at least your wallet isn't hurting. Here, you'll get something that doesn't quite fulfill the craving, doesn't feel guilty, and hurts your wallet. Not exactly my ideal milkshake or dessert option.  It's still definitely worth trying, and the $12 spiked milkshakes are almost fair priced even if downed in basically a minute. $3 cookies sound a bit much, but cookies are generally expensive if you're not getting some cheap grocery option. At the same time, you can get like 50 cookies from Safeway for like $5 so you should also consider that.  Milk Bar will be a welcome addition, but definitely not something I'll get every day when I'm in Vegas, or even once a trip.

The items that I took home were the crack pie, blueberry and cream cookie, compost cookie, and chocolate chocolate cookie. The crack pie was quite small, but it was really good in my opinion! I did not like the blueberry and cream cookie since it taste saltier than expected and had the taste of a type of blueberry muffin that I did not like.

The milkquakes are supposed to be similar to a Dairy Queen blizzard or a mcflurry. To my surprise neither was overly sweet, and taste was rather enjoyable. What missed the mark were all the leftover bits at the bottom of the milkquake. A large  boba tea straw  is provided however the chunks are too overwhelming for the straw and unfortunately no regular spoons are available, all that can be obtained is a wooden spatula type.  Also the consistency between the 2 milkquakes differed greatly, one was too thick to drink with the straw and the other was super runny.

Being local I've been back a few times during the day - no long lines and one Saturday night during CES and was 12 deep. Not a factor cause the staff was prepared and had the line moving pretty well. Each time that I have went, the staff was really helpful and if there was a lag in service, they apologized cause some of them were still learning how to make certain things.   The Crack Pie - on point, just like the one I tried at the east coast Milk Bar. The crack pie in shake form - yeah 10 bucks but it is Vegas. Competition will cause the prices to lower a little and stabilize. (maybe) Really sweet and rich - so bring your sweet tooth or have something pretty savory beforehand.   Cookies - had them all but my fav is the compost and Corn flake with choc. and marshmallow. The one I liked the least was the chocolate chocolate chip.

Weird.  Anyhow, I've been to two MilkBars in NYC, have had their products several times since, and got to enjoy their pre-opening event with Christina Tosi. I'm trying not to be biased but on the fact that my teeth are practically made from sugar, that's hard.  To start, their online customer service is great! Since their online ordering system isn't running on their site yet, I messaged their Instagram and got great response from there to send an email to their customer service. I got in touch with Grace who was super responsive to all my requests and changes. I was ordering a cake for my mom's birthday, several tins of cookies, crack pies, and truffles-- all to bring back home to San Diego for friends and family. Friends, I might add, born and raised in Queens/Brooklyn/New Jersey-- so they're not necessarily into the hype of Milkbar. They legit miss it after moving West.  I recommend ordering ahead of time for pick up if you know what you want, and perhaps want more than 2 cookies or pies. Reason being is that they run out. You walk up, take the cookies you want from the basket, order whatever else, pay, and then enjoy it standing. Dessert to go. The Cornflake Cookie and Choco Marshmallow baskets were empty-- this was a Friday at 5pm that I was picking up. The line was no wait (yet) but there was a constant stream of customers.  I received my 2 bags full of goodies quickly-- but made sure to double check because they did give me an incorrect order (A WHOLE CRACK PIE instead of 3 slices-- but my conscience got the best of me and I told them of the mess up). I also got a free cereal milk (requested a larger cup due to potential spillage) with cereal. Now, I LOATHE cereal, simply because I am not big on drinking milk (since I'm not 6 months old nursing or 5 and trying to grow an inch you know..)  and I hate the sogginess of cereal after a while.. but THIS WAS YUM. I think this is the only way I will eat cereal and milk.. add some alcohol to a shake and you have the adult version of eating a 4 year old's breakfast. They open at 9am so you ideally get it for breakfast.   Their cakes are sweet- Not for everyone. You might enjoy a truffle better. Actually everything is sweet.. so prepare to eat in phases.   To end-- lessons learned: 1. Park in the east tower side of the garage and take the elevator up to 2. As soon as you walk out it's on the left (past the Juice bar).  2. Order online if you plan on getting several cookies anyway. You don't have to show up to find out they don't even have what you want. Catch is that you pay ahead.. but that's fine.. and  you have to wait in line to pick up. You can also pre-order your shake. Of course they'll just make it when you get there.  3. Prices are slightly more expensive than their East Coast counterparts.  4. If you love this place, buy in bulk and freeze.  5. They really value YELP reviews so I'm sure your words do not fall on deaf ears.", "Date": "2017-01-11", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ron", "ReviewID": "vT6Qdq6lVRVg4987Wwy1Iw", "Overall": "1", "Content": "Beyond disappointing. Went here the second day after they opened at 10 am there doors were shut. Went again an hour later the doors were still shut. Went to concierge and they called them and they lied to concierge saying they've been open since 10.   We came back today 1/7/17 a few days. We ordered the deal sampler thing, a coffee milk shake, and the birthday quake.   We were trying to get a quick treat before having to walk over to bellagio for o and wanted to get free parking at cosmo while it lasted. We had 45 min, which we thought was plenty of time. No one was in line and 3 shakes were ordered before us (they obviously got there things before us and we saw). There had to be about 7-10 people on staff there. Only 1 person was making orders, everyone else was chatting in front of the register while this poor girl is struggling to make these orders.   We were given the cookies and truffles and pie at the register so we had those but had to wait 25 minutes to get our milk shake and quake. Then had to remind them to give us our soft serve which they made ever so slowly. it was ice cream and cornflakes. We weren't sure why it took so long but we went with it.   The compost cookie was terrible. I like pretzels and stuff, but it just tried too hard. The crack pie is def overrated. I would prefer the pecans. The lady described it like a pecan pie without pecans, I wasn't paying attention so i got excited for pecans to realize she said without them. that's my b,. The birthday truffle was too sweet for me. The birthday quake had an off taste that i wasn't a fan of and the coffee milkshake wasn't sweet enough oddly. We then were out 60 bucks and didn't like anything. So we went back with the milk shake hopping they would remake us something else. We asked what they recommended and we got a chocolate shake. Can't go wrong with that. We then realized we jinxed it. It was bitter and not sweet, so we tossed it in a garbage and left.   I love the cosmo hotel, but there not putting good things in place of the old, and the prices are just highway robbery. I don't see this location lasting and go there with no expectations that way you might enjoy overpriced desserts, or just go to sweet raku!", "Date": "2017-01-08", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Michelle", "ReviewID": "iD5gsANrqpxeRKrAszWOHw", "Overall": "3", "Content": "Milkshake was way too sweet.

With the fire of a thousand suns, I hate it.  I avoid it at all costs.  So why then was I happily driving down Las Vegas Blvd at 3:00pm on a Friday afternoon?  Milk Bar.  Oh, sweet, sweet Milk Bar.  Yelp Elites got a tiny little preview of the goodies at Milk Bar a couple weeks ago, and I've been wanting to pop back in to see the shop, since they weren't open for business when we had our preview.  A little about Milk Bar:  This is Chef Christina Tosi's 10th Milk Bar store in...8 years?  (She told us at the preview, but my notes are at home.) Its the first on the West Coast.  And I am SO glad that its here.  Milk Bar is a little walk up storefront right across from the Chandelier Bar at the Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino.   Its not a coffee shop set up: there are no tables or seating, other than a small bench to wait for a shake or a quake.   They have  grab your own  cookies laid out on the counter as you walk up to order, which was awesome.  I grabbed a compost cookie and a corn cookie and made my way up to the very friendly cashier.    In addition to my 2 cookies, I also ordered a crack pie to take home...to my husband.  Yup.  Not for me at all...really....*shifty eyes*, and a crack pie soft serve.  I had to.  It sounded too good to pass up.  I took the baked treats home, and inhaled the soft serve on my way to the car, and in the car.  Pro tip...I know it LOOKS like an ice cream cone...but you definitely want to make sure you grab a spoon from the counter.  I made a pretty big mess of myself trying to get the ice cream from inside the cup without a spoon, and...yeah.  Lets just say, I haven't been that messy eating ice cream since I was bout 3 years old.  But it was SO.  DAMNED.  DELICIOUS.  Seriously sweet, rich, but light at the same time...I gave myself a brain freeze twice, I couldn't eat it fast enough.    When I got home, my husband and I shared the cookies. Pro tip #2:  Warm them up!  There is just something comforting and wonderful about a warm, chewy cookie.  Husband's favorite was the compost cookie:  pretzels, potato chips, coffee, oats, graham cracker, butterscotch and chocolate chips.  Sweet.  Salty.  Wonderful.  Chewy in the middle.  Mmmmmmmm. The corn cookie was next, and this...this reminded me of a cross between (and this might sound REALLY weird):  cornbread, and a SWEET CORN tamale.  It was amazing.  Sweet, chewy...I kind of wanted to put more butter on it, because that's how I eat my cornbread, but I refrained.    Finally, the crack pie.  It's called crack pie for a reason folks.  A toasted oat crust with a gooey butter filling, it is sweet.  Buttery.  Delicious.  The crust is light and wonderful.    Milk Bar sells Christina Tosi's cookbooks, as well as sturdy canvas bags with the birthday layer cake deconstructed on it, and the softest scarves you'll ever wear.  Fun little mementos.    Prices aren't bad.  Some items are a little spendy, but you ARE on The Strip, after all.  I honestly cannot WAIT to go back to try a Fancy shake (boozy shake!).  It was a little out of my price range this trip, but I will most definitely be heading back soon.", "Date": "2017-01-08", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ellen", "ReviewID": "ZBQxAvB5vW4OdfZZsaRE5Q", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Over hyped and overpriced.  Went on opening day..not much of a wait to order.   I ordered the  Greatest Hits  combo and the strawberry-corn milkquake.  Service was fast, but they did make a mistake with our order which resulted in a free sweet potato milkquake.    The milkquakes (made only in Las Vegas) are supposed to be similar to a Dairy Queen blizzard. As I tried the strawberry corn milkquake, my first impression likened it to a McFlurry without an adequate spoon for eating. Milk Bar has flat wooden spatulas (larger ones are provided with the milk quake than what is on the counter). The flat spatula shape made it incredibly difficult to actually scoop the bits in the milkquake. The strawberry corn milkquake was a lot thicker consistency wise in comparison to the sweet potato milkquake we also had. Taste was so-so as I would often get a chunk of corn cereal or blob of strawberry jelly/preserve stuck in my  bubble tea sized straw). Presentation for the milkquake was also lacking. For $10, I expected something more than a clear plastic cup with a domed lid.   Greatest hits combo:  A nice option for those who are new to Milk Bar & want to try a little bit of everything. Presentation was lacking also as it comes in a basic brown paper bag  partially  stamped with the milk logo (see attached pics). I've had take out food presented in better packaging than this. The bday truffles were decent, but I feel like they don't match the 3 for $6 price tag (as they are very similar to a starbucks cake pop). Compost cookies were not anything special either. I know they're made up of Chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, coffee, graham cracker crust, pretzels and even potato chips...but in all honesty, the flavors were muddled together and the cookie itself was drier and smaller than expected for a $3 cookie. The crack pie was ridiculously SMALL. Upon opening the clever cardboard packaging, I was shocked to realize that I had paid $6.50 for a slice of pie smaller than my hand. Marketed as a twist on the traditional Chess pie, the Crack pie was disappointing...if served independent from it's wrapper, i would not be able to identify anything unique about it. The cereal milk soft serve is just okay, a gimmicky flavor to try if you like cereal--as it tastes like cap n crunch flavored milk.   All in all, my opening day experience at Milk Bar was disappointing. Presentation, portions, and taste just don't match the hype or cost.  I believe there are plenty of other better looking and better priced options for sweets in Las Vegas...don't waste your dollars or calories on this one.", "Date": "2017-01-03", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Rebecca", "ReviewID": "lTJvc1DiPoE02ytk2SZ1ig", "Overall": "5", "Content": "We were staying at the Cosmo and came here for a late night dessert!

Not knowing what to try, I settled on the  Greatest Hits  ($19), which came with: slice of crack pie, cereal milk soft serve, bday truffles (3), and a compost cookie. I also purchased the corn cookie and the corn flake chocolate chip marshmallow cookie.  My least favorite was the cereal milk soft serve with crunch. It didn't really taste like much and was small! The crack pie was also small. What a rip off. The crack pie was good, not amazing. Bday truffles had a strange mouth feel, like too doughy, undercooked, or flour-y.  It wasn't that enjoyable. I really wanted to try the birthday cake, but they don't sell it by the slice, only whole ($56).  I did like the cookies! I would try them all again, but I liked the corn cookie the best!  One big flaw they have is no where to sit or even high top tables to enjoy your treats. Customer service was excellent though.

Three, the crack pie literally just tasted like cold sugar ice cream with some tiny cookie bits. I literally was appalled by the sugar content. I never had the east coast version but this experience was pretty bad and I don't recommend this place. I much prefer the milkshakes from Burgr by Gordon Ramsey in PH or Shake Shack in NYNY Hotel.

Again very rich and flavorful and a cross between pecan pie and peanut brittle (without the nuts) but it's one of those things where the whole pie is in front of you and 10 mins later you look down and nothing is there cause your fat ass ate the whole damn thing without realizing it.

I have very mixed feelings about how to rate this place because some of the reviews are nitpicky as hell (but they bring up a lot of valid points), but the product is pretty good. Worth the Strip price-hike though? Debatable.   LOCATION: Inside the Cosmo, easily accessible from the parking garage. Walkup counter, no dedicated seating, Chandelier Bar has couches and Eggslut has counter seating nearby. Other locations are walkup only, so this shouldn't be an issue. But a lot of people dislike it.  PRICING: Compared to NYC locations, prices are a bit higher (+75c per cookie, +$1 for Crack Pie Slice, +$1.50 soft serve, +$3 for greatest hits combo, etc.). Similarly, their Milk Quakes are $12 compared to other alcoholic shake options nearby that are $15. But the other place has larger portions and great presentation, too.  SERVICE: Fine. No complaints. My order was taken by friendly staff. I waited on one of my items for a few minutes and a staff member asked what I was waiting on, noticed it had been forgotten, and made it immediately.   PRODUCT: Sampled a little bit of everything with the Greatest Hits Combo ($19). There are also mixes, cookbooks, tote bags, scarves, and such available for gifting. Cereal Milk Soft Serve- other reviews say the flavor is bland and portion is small, but I could barely eat half of it. I'm not a corn flake fan but the texture was appreciated and enhanced the flavor, which had a nice pinch of saltiness to it like you really get at the bottom of a bowl.  Compost Cookie- #nocrunchycookies! This had the perfect texture of soft and chewy, but not falling apart. Interesting combination of flavors but I can't really say I liked it. Maybe I'll try other cookie flavors in the future, but the NYC price is a lot more appealing. Birthday Truffles- I couldn't decide if I liked this. Nice hint of bday cake flavor but really sweet. Only ate one of the pack of three and that was enough. This might be fun for gifting though. Crack Pie- It's like pecan pie without the pecans and I like that it isn't too sweet but I'm not about to get addicted. As others have said, the slice is tiny. For the price, it should be deeper/taller. It's a nice little treat but the cardboard sleeve packaging preventing you from seeing the portion size is a bit deceptive. Birthday Cake!- Okay, full disclosure, I got the cake free through an IG promo. The 6  regularly retails for $56. The portion claims to feed 8-12, and I'd say that's accurate. It's fairly tasty and not too sweet, and I like how the crumbles add texture. The  naked  decoration style also keeps the ratio of cake to frosting more even, and the multiple layers are both pretty and help to distribute the frosting. Would I eat it again? Probably. Would I pay nearly $60 for this cake? Probably not. Unclear why the crack pie is available whole or sliced but their self-proclaimed  fan favorite  cake is not.   In short, it's A-OK. It's exciting that we have a Milk Bar location on the West coast and I'm glad I tried it, but even if I happen to be at the Cosmo, it's not a must-go place for me.
