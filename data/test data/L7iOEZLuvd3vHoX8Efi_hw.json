Just a tip for the guys @ New Shanghai, do not argue with your customers in front of other customers and expect to get a nice tip. Hey server guy, do not expect to vent to your customers about your stupid boss and expect my sympathy. No bueno.  This place gives Chinese restaurants a bad name. SHAME ON YOU new shanghai!

The restaurant was a ghost town on a Saturday night.  We were the only ones in the restaurant for the first half of our meal.  While we ate, the employees were either collaborating with the cleaning of the fish tank or kept pacing around our table.  Can you say, awkward and uncomfortable?!  We ordered the following:  * Shanghai fried noodles: these noodles would put Shanghainese people to shame.  It was more like an Americanized chow mein.  The noodles weren't the authentic thick and round kind, and the taste was a far cry from what I'm accustomed to.  Gross.    * Xiaolong bao: the XLB were decent but you could detect the thawed taste in the meat filling--obviously frozen, not fresh.  * Fish fillets in wine and vinegar sauce: mediocre dish, but the wine and vinegar ratio was very imbalanced.  It was more vinegary than drunken.  * Wheat gluten (mian jin) and mushroom dish for our veggie friend: the mian jin was funky--way too spongy and slimy inside.  What finally broke the camel's back for us was the service.  Keep in mind it was just us and another couple dining here.  Also keep in mind that we were here around 9pm and the restaurant has a huge neon Chinese sign on the outside that says  late night meals.   So they were obviously not closing anytime soon.  But midway during our meal, one of the male servers comes over and tells us to take the last XLB from the steamer.  We tell him,  we'll get to it later, please keep it here.   As if he didn't understand our Mandarin, he continued ushering us to take the last XLB.  So we continued telling him to leave it alone.  But he wouldn't budge.  So for the sake of not causing a scene, we gave in and just took the darn thing.  It was annoying and rude.  What was the darn rush?  Soon after that incident, he just kept hovering and pacing around our table.  And that's why we gave them less than 10% tip...", "Date": "2009-01-09", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Dean", "ReviewID": "-82xMoQt5nP2RUfiNvVpUw", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Very good food.

We ordered: -Eggs w/ Tomato -Potstickers -Shanghai Xiao Lung Bao -Bai Cai and Ruo Si (Napa Cabbage w/ slice pork) -Xiang Gan Ruo Si  -Jiu Niang Tang Ruan (Rice Wine Desert)   I thought the egg w/ tomatos and napa cabbage was very nice. all the other stuff were pretty decent and very good with rice. the rice was also very well cooked. some restaurants don't have good rice, which is a killer.   the service was pretty good since there wasn't a lot of people. bad business, but some decent food", "Date": "2009-06-02", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Anthony", "ReviewID": "K5KQcrbsYZ3ZAFSOg1-e8A", "Overall": "3", "Content": "I was here for a Taiwanese breakfast and was very pleased with the Xiao Long Bao. It was not Din Tai Fung quality but for $2.95 it was a great value. The soup inside was delicious and the thickness of the skin and the taste of the meat were right on. (Be aware that only the first order of 8 is priced at $2.95. Additional orders are $6.95.)  The soybean milk was soybean milk to me, I lacked the expertise to distinguish between excellent vs. average here. The chinese donut (yao tew) was not very crispy and somewhat hard. The scallion pancake was disappointing, it was hard and bland. I feel like giving a 4 star here due to the Xiao Long Bao, but the other items drag it down to a 3 star.  Service was without a smile which is not surprising for chinese dive joints. Our waiter looked like he wished he was on a beach in Hawaii.  I'd recommend you go there and order two baskets of XLB for each person in your party and call it a day!", "Date": "2008-06-22", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jing", "ReviewID": "-1wSj5AvodgW8_Jdu979ZA", "Overall": "1", "Content": "The window advertises xiao long bao (soup dumplings) for $2.99 for 8, for lunch, limit one per table. It's clearly a scheme to get you to come in. When we asked for it, they said it was $7.99. False advertising!  This place had terrible service. The first time we asked for water, it never came. Then there was a waiter that stood around looking bored, and didn't see me frantically wave at him for several minutes. When they brought a big tub of soup, they didn't even give us bowls for the soup, and we had to ask for it separately.  On top of all that, they put a gratuity charge on the check for a party of _three_. Last I checked, that was not normal except for large parties. I would have like the choice to give a 10% tip, given how bad the service was.  Overall, the food was okay, but expensive. Not a pleasant experience, and the wait-staff was pretty bad. I would not recommend this place to anyone.", "Date": "2008-12-27", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Mr", "ReviewID": "ccpLSu59qRsMDx1mFZ7CSQ", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Planned to go to one of the buffets in the hotels but realized it was too late for the ones we wanted instead we headed down to 'Chinatown' and hit up Shanghai Restaurant for dinner.

There were 2 lady servers and 1 man, all were very disorganized and MEAN!   The servers would not stop yelling and arguing amongst themselves, and the yelling would continue throughout the whole restaurant.  The servers argued in a loud yelling manner to one customer that received an incorrect order, the customer yelled right back  which started a crazy yelling match, 2 lady servers vs. a lady customer!    There was no follow-up service, and the wicked servers (which I believed own the place) would rather have you not in there!!!  During our meal there were multiple customers that walked out on them, GOOD CHOICE, WISH WE WOULD'VE WALKED OUT BEFORE WE HAD A CHANCE!!!    I've never seen servers so relieved to see customers walk away--Out the Door!  And like some of the other reviewers said, they try to sell you appetizers and just bring them out to you;  forcing you to eat them!!  If you order and refuse an item you are destined for a BIG Argument!  I can stand poor/bad service sometimes, but when I go to a restaurant I expect to at least not, get yelled at very loudly (indeed it happened to us once when we got napkins off another table because there was NO Service), see other patrons having yelling matches with the servers, see employees yelling at eachother constantly, and fighting to pay your bill and being told to wait (at least 30 mins.)!  NEVER EVER GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!", "Date": "2009-07-08", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
