I went up to order my usual white gummy.. and the gentleman helping me asked politely if I've tried the other flavored gummy smoothies.    0_0 whaaaat?   apparently there are more flavors in the gummy bear smoothies fam.  grape, orange... but I stood true to my favorite and declined the offer to try something new...

However, for my birthday I received a gift card, and this is the closet Jamba to where I work. Due to the gift card, I've had the opportunity to enjoy what Jamba has to offer. I've had a variety of the fruit smoothies, the coffee smoothie and the tea smoothies. The fruit smoothies aren't really my thing because they taste very artificial to me. I watch them make the smoothies, I know fruit is in them, but they must put something else in there. I like the coffee smoothies, but the calories are crazy high in them. That being said, they are really tasty, and they are a bit more  milk shake  like than other smoothie brands I've had, so they are a bit easier to drink. The latest smoothie I had was the chai tea smoothie (with soy). I liked the flavor and consistency, though a bit more spice would have been nice.   The staff I've encountered at this  Jamba are exceptional. They are always friendly, always prompt, and always have a smile for me and the other customers in the store. The service alone, is worth 2 stars.   I probably won't hit up Jamba much after my gift card is used up, but I am happy I've been able to find a couple of the drinks I enjoy without having to pay for them :-)", "Date": "2010-09-02", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Jennifer", "ReviewID": "5H0HYEvQ8cdXcDlYQD8BoA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "Oh Jamba!

He explained what I could drink, what was safe to drink, and I ordered the smoothy that he designed only to feel energized without the side effects of diabetes. He was very kind.

Food items differ greatly between the two competing smoothie places. I've never tried the food here but some things look appealing: flatbreads, oatmeal, and meal smoothies. Basically, we come here for the smoothies. The good thing about this place is that there is a three size menu for the smoothies: sixteen, original, & power. (Like Tropical Smoothie Cafe, weekdays feature Happy Hour- upgrade to power size for less than a dollar- Sold!) Another plus, take out menus here include nutritional information. Another thing to mention is the many  varieties: all fruit, jamba light, blended with a purpose, classics, creamy treats, and iced tead fruit infusions- and boost options, thirteen to be exact, like energy boost, soy protein, and weight burner.  My husband's favorite smoothie here is the Peanut Butter Moo'd (creamy treat), which is also featured in the 'Don't Eat That  section in those popular books  Eat this, Not that , due to high calorie & fat content. I've tried the all fruit smoothies but something was lacking (one of the mango ones could of used some nonfat yogurt). Maybe the low calorie focus was the tradeoff, but I decided to try other flavors. The Pomegranate Paradise is made with pomegranate juice, strawberries, mangos, and peaches. I really liked it but my husband said it was a little sour. With 3.5 servings of fruit, it's easy to get your daily 6-9 daily recommended fruits/veggies. My husband got the Aloha Pineapple- pineapple juice, strawberries, bananas, pineapple sherbet, and nonfat plain yogurt. His tasted really sweet compared to mine. I will try other ones since there are summer specials. I love the variety.    Summer (only) deals include: Mondays- 12 oz meal smoothies $3, Tuesdays- 16 oz. alll fruit smoothies $3, Wednesdays- $2 oatmeal, Thursdays- $1 off Tea & Coffee smoothies, Fridays- $1 baked good with purchase of any menu drink.", "Date": "2010-07-03", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Ramil", "ReviewID": "CrBpMOZg-GmXTVC-gKMuQA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "This is my favorite Jamba Juice location!  One may ask how a place like this stands out if it's part of a chain because they all try to follow the same standards. However, what makes this location different from the rest is the fact that if you order your drink fix with an extra boost they will automatically upgrade you to the next size drink (for free)! Paying for the extra boost is actually cheaper than paying for the larger size. I tried this at other locations and none of them do it except this one (total turn off).   I haven't been here for awhile and was unaware of the happy 2 for $5, untill Christina O. had mentioned it. And now that I do know makes me like Jamba Juice even more because other smoothie places can't beat that deal.    Since it is in a new plaza (McCarren Market Place) everything inside is brand spanking new, which is nice. Compared to other locations I think this one is one of the bigger ones. And the staff here are super friendly. I love the fact this is the closest Jamba to me. I've been here multiple times and I have never had a problem.

I tend to hop all over the menu mostly because I like all fruit and I don't have anything I really can't stand.   And just to be clear - they have amazing oatmeal. Oh I love it so much. Steel cut oats with fruit and other toppings. Don't say it isn't good - it is!   I love that they also have the wheatgrass shots here. They are amazingly refreshing and good for you. Try one if you haven't yet.   This particular JJ has a nice staff, very accommodating and helpful. They're right outside a gym so I assume hey have to get quite busy at peak times, but whenever I get in here there's only a few patrons or none at all.

Try to use it and get told that it was used two days ago in California so I can't use it here. Doesn't seem to matter that the coupon wasn't even good then. Date on it was for today. So try to explain this and get told that  once one person somewhere in the country uses a coupon anywhere in the country that no one else anywhere can use them. That it what the self proclaimed  general manager  said. I am pretty sure that is not accurate. He just argued that  this happens to people all the time and he already started making the smoothies so we HAD to pay for them both.  This place is ridiculous and I will 100 percent never come back to this location or any other location for that matter. What a joke.  One person in the country gets to use the coupon . So after that crap explanation of nothing I say screw it and pay for two smoothies. Both identical. Both larges. What did I get you ask? I got two different size cups. One large and one medium. So yet again I ask the   general manager   why they are different sizes and he just stared at me. I asked again and all he could come with is  different smoothies have different sizes! I point out they are identical drinks and he says   nothing I can do now they are already made. I point out I paid for two larges yet again and he says  very sorry, nothing I can do . So now this place has taken money from me and not given me what I paid for and the boss man says that is company policy. So company policy is if an employee makes the wrong drink that's on the customer.
