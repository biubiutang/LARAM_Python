My first time was after watching UFC 98. I believe the official after party was here if memory serves correctly. This is a large fancy place with lots of open space. Everything is upscale and nicely decorated. A very popular spot that has fallen in and out of being the  in  place to be over the years. Its definitely in the running as a popular place, maybe not as loved as PURE.  If you stay in the hotel I remember getting in free. I'm not sure if that is still the case but no matter what if you are going to be drinking at a club I would always advise to take a look at the club that happens to be at the hotel in which you are staying. If you are really particular about a club in Vegas my tip would be to stay at the hotel in which your favorite club is in.", "Date": "2016-05-04", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Sarah", "ReviewID": "ghHoh1bO_Z9UjHbNf8-phQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "If you want to be treated like a vip, Colton is your guy!

I spontaneously went to LAX this past weekend & had the time of my life. Colten was my host & he made it the easiest thing in life. He was very efficient & quickly replied to my texts & answered all my questions. He was super friendly & I received top notch service from him, along with the manager of LAX who personally introduced himself to our group. LAX is definitely a fantastic option if you're looking for a fun night out on the town & don't follow all the hype of the edm & house craze. they have a nice mix of music, some older hip hop mixed with new pop & r&b. Honestly all of my expectations were exceeded by far & this was the funnest night i've had in a LOOOOOONG time.   Moral of the story: come to LAX, & have Colten as your host.

From the hostess to the bartenders, everyone is really friendly.   TIP: Get yourself on a guest list so you can get free entrance.

That isn't to say it's completely off but make sure that you're coming to the area for the right expectations and crowds.    I was at LAX for an after-party mixed with a seemingly regular club night.  It's a fairly big club, starting with a big climb up the stairs.  There's a weird dungeon hole (exclusive VIP area when I was there) as you walk over to the main dance floor and a ton of tables.  The dance floor oddly is segmented off a little bit to the side which makes for a lot of room to see the dance floor/DJ above the stairs but the dance floor itself seemed a little small.  Drinks seemed a little cheaper than other, bigger clubs while the crowd was a mix of the younger after-party segment as well as some of the older clientele.  The music the night I went was a mix of techno/light electric hits.    All-around, there's nothing really off per say that I would say one should absolutely avoid the club...but there isn't anything to say that would necessarily persuade me to stop on by other than perhaps a DJ name or being at the hotel itself (which for guys is usually a reduced rate - girls for free).", "Date": "2016-07-22", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Crystal", "ReviewID": "Ws960bjrAwgJfuzIuQVBAA", "Overall": "5", "Content": "So we went here for a bachelorette weekend and it was great we got on a guest list so no cover but the DJ for Saturday was great he played late 90's early 2000's to recent songs which is great because the age group in the club was mixed (not bad mixed like a bunch of old ppl but good).

In comparison to others I've been to on the strip such as Tao and Hakkasan, LAX is smaller but plays a much better selection of music. The dance floor isn't as big but is a decent size with bars placed on each side for easy access. This was the weekend of the McGregor Vs. Diaz fight in Vegas so Donald  Cowboy  Cerrone made an appearance in the club to celebrate his victory which got the crowd pretty pumped. To add, there wasn't a single dancer in there that night that wasn't an eye catcher.  For the drinks, they're pretty expensive so make sure to bring lots of cash or drink up before heading inside so you don't have to spend as much. The drinks are mixed strong so that's a plus I guess.  I normally wouldn't boast on a night at a night club but this was a blast.
