After visiting, we're now only surprised that it got good reviews.  Our experience was very much Jekyll and Hyde. The food was either really good (artichoke appetizer, sausage and mushroom rigatoni, clam linguini) or very disappointing (fried ravioli way overdone, lasagna pasta mushy and falling apart, veal parmesan so smothered in sauce that the breading just fell off).   Same with service:  All the staff were friendly, but service was excessively slow. Slow to get seated, slow for waiters to acknowledge us, slow for food to get out, and slow to get refills and the check. I hate ragging on friendly servers, but when the service is this slow, it's bad service even if they're friendly.  It does not help that value proposition was suspect. Dishes are not large to begin with, plus they give a lot of pasta and sauce but seem stingy on the meat and stuff that matters.  Almost forgot - wine list is very disappointing, but they offer cheap corkage, so bring your own if you insist on coming here. But I'd just as soon recommend to go elsewhere. There are a lot of better Italian options - even in the close-by areas.", "Date": "2013-03-21", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Marcus", "ReviewID": "gik6qw0p6bh1PUrvIciDpw", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Pasta: over-cooked Lasagna, drenched in Cheese, no Bechamel.

It was fine, but the food was pretty pedestrian.  The wait staff were friendly enough, but not mistake-free.  Our server forgot to bring our soup before bringing our main courses, so he asked if it was ok to bring it to go.  We said yes because our other food was there, but it wasn't really a good solution overall.  At least he could have given us a little bigger amount given the mistake, but we still got just the small cupfuls.  We split a large caesar salad.  It was plain - no shredded parmesan or asiago, just romaine, dressing, and croutons i think (obviously not memorable).  I can't recall what  my husband ate but I had something with the red pepper sauce that is supposed to be one of their signature dishes.  It was just ok.  The ambiance is friendly and homey - vinyl checkered tablecloths.  The prices aren't too bad but I don't think they should be any higher for this sort of place.  I was really looking forward to trying Buon Gusto, which had been recommended to us and was sad to have been disappointed.  Probably won't end up back there as there are a lot of alternatives (Pasta Shop, Ventano's, Gaetano's all nicer, Montesano's seemed like a better deal for the money with similar ambiance).", "Date": "2015-03-22", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Gerry", "ReviewID": "b_lSNEfAOgKNjFMPjhLp1Q", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Had dinner here two hours ago.

The staff was also very professional and quick to fulfill every need.   Right away our server brought out fresh, hot sliced bread with olive oil, garlic and balsamic... Wow! Great start to our meal.. I ordered the pasta with garlic and olive oil which included a salad with their house made ranch(which was creamy and delicious). My husband had the lasagna which came out piping hot.. still boiling in the pan.. I can definitely say that the lasagna was the best I've tasted.. the presentation being a plus. His dinner also included a salad which he upgraded to a caesar salad. To top our meal off, we had Chef Joel's signature bread pudding for dessert. WOW!!!!

The Calamari was very lightly breaded and had the right amount of salt for seasoning.  My wife loved it and even though I'm not the biggest fan, I thought it was pretty great as well.  My wife ordered the Manicotti and it was some of the best I've ever had.  I had the Sicilian Style Eggplant which is baked and topped with Mozzerella cheese.  It was very good and there was a lot of it.  The waitress was great and the timing of the appetizer, salads, and entrees was perfect.

We have gone here for years and enjoyed the food and service from the family owned restaurant. Well....just went today and either it has changed hands or is under new management. None of the previous family owners or staff were there. It was sooooo dark in the place that we had to use the flashlight on the cell phone to read the menu. We should have left at that point. My partner ordered a lunch special which was a slice of pizza and a side salad. I ordered a hot sandwich which also came with a side salad. I asked what dressings they had and when the waiter mentioned caesar dressing I said I would have that. He then told me that caesar dressing was $1 extra. Told him not to bother. We then ordered our drinks. He never bothered to bring staws and we had to ask for them. About 5 min later my partner was served her pizza and salad. Her salad had ranch dressing on it but you had to really look to find any. Guess ranch is expensive as well?? I got my salad. After about another 5 min I asked if there was a problem with my sandwich and was told rather rudely that it took time and would be ready soon. Another 10 min and my partner had already finished her food and I told they guy to forget the sandwich and bring the bill. He rudely told me it had only been 5 min and it would be ready soon. Anyway he finally bright the bill and had charged us for all the food and drink even though I had cancelled the sandwich before it was served. We gave him a $20 bill and asked for change. The revised bill and change did not show up so went to the counter and told him to give me the change and to revise the bill. Eventually another person came over and revised the bill and we got our change and left. I have not had this rude of service anywhere in years and not once did anyone in the restaurant apologize or even say they were sorry. The pizza was just ok, dont know about the rest of the food.....never got any. The staff even had the nerve to suggest that rather than change the bill they would fix the sandwich to go. It would only take a couple of minutes. !!!! Right !!!!! Anyway dont know when it changed hands but this place is horrible now. Will not go back...you could not pay me enough money to return.

The gnocchi itself was tender and clearly home made, but the sauce tasted more like a cheese sauce than a tomato Vodka.

But, Buon Gusto shines every time. It is a small family run New York style Italian restaurant. The place is tiny, so expect to wait for a table, sometimes up to 30 minutes. Don't worry the food is well worth the wait. They always start you off with warm bread and an olive oil and balsamic dipping sauce. It is perfection, especially after the wait. Your dish will also come with soup or a salad. They have 2 homemade dressings, a delicious ranch and a house oil and balsamic dressing that is fantastic. You can't go wrong either way, but I love to dip my bread in the house dressing. Yum! I have tried quite a few dishes, but here are some of the highlights:  I am in love with the sausage and mushroom rigatoni. It is tossed in a creamy tomato based sauce and just so delicious. You won't ever regret ordering this, trust me.  They make a mean baked ziti as well, their signature pasta sauce is just delicious. You definitely want the sausage, as the meatballs are lacking in flavor.   They also have fantastic thin crust pizza's! I have tried both the California white pizza and Steve's cattleman and they were great. I love white pizza and the California definitely hit the spot. But, they also make a fabulous red sauce so be sure to try that as well. The individual size is perfect for one.  Overall, you will not regret a visit to this small mom and pop shop.

It didn't take much arm-twisting for her to convince me to try it out for dinner on a recent Friday evening.   The owners hail from Brooklyn and serve up excellent food at fair prices. It's a smaller restaurant, complete with memorabilia from NYC all over the walls. When we arrived it was packed with another party waiting to be seated. Sandi, one of the owners, was working as the hostess and she was great. Not only did she give us a pretty accurate idea of how long we would be waiting, she also came over to let us know when the party seated at the table we were going to be sitting at was done eating.   Our waitress took our drink order and brought out some complementary warm bread and oil to dip it in. We had my friend's two children with her that were starving, so she ordered food for them while I continued to look over the menu. When their slices of pizza were ready, the other owner, Steve, brought them out to our table.  I ended up ordering the spaghetti and meatballs, my friend had the eggplant parmigiana, NY style. I was given the option to switch to whole wheat or gluten free pasta for an additional charge, I didn't do it but like that it was an option. Both entrees came with choice of soup or salad, I chose the salad with house dressing (made in house as all house dressings should be) and she had the soup which was Italian wedding soup. Both of these came out very quickly. The salad wasn't anything to write home about but it the veggies were fresh.   We waited close to an hour from the time we ordered for our entrees to come out. Our waitress was very apologetic, which we appreciated, but she made the mistake of telling us our food should be out in  4 minutes  ( not  a few minutes  which would have made more sense) which of course did not happen.   In the end, the food was worth the wait. The meatballs were excellent, and the portion was massive.

I had never been and 2. she hadn't been in a while. When we go there, the venue was very small, and we had to move the table forward so we could both sit comfortably (I'm 6'8 ).  The waiter was very professional, which was nice to see. He was able to accommodate my friends tomato allergies and make suggestions around it as well. We looked at the menu and almost everything was at least $14. Luckily, we had gotten there around lunch time, so we were able to chose from a menu of $8. Unfortunately, there is no substitutions on that menu, so my friend could only goose from two dishes.   I asked the waiter what the portions were like for the lunch menu, and he said that they were just a smidgen smaller than the dinner plate. We both ordered our drinks and food, and that's when we got bamboozled. They added $3 for the chicken in my chicken Alfredo, and when I asked for caesar dressing, they wanted to up charge me another $2. I said no, so we waited for our meals. My coke was pretty flat, so I was already in a sour mood about that. When the chicken Alfredo got there, it was 40% pasta and 60% sauce. The chicken tasted off and was very watery. We wanted to get dessert, but the next time we saw the waiter, he brought us our check instead of asking about dessert. We took that as a sign and went elsewhere.
