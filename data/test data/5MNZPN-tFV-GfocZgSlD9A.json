Oh my God, it is cute inside! I know a German Restaurant in town that could use the charm of this place!!!! It has a full bar (with German beer -of course!) and kitchen (kitchen is usually only used for their Tuesday Night Vintage Vegas Jazz evenings, Saturday Dinners and the once a month Sunday brunch.  They said the Club is also available for Special Event rentals. Most of the members are above the age of 50 (but I was told they have been getting a small influx of younger members recently).  Best to check their website for hours of operation, But they are open Tuesday evenings for Jazz,  (sometimes) on Thursday evenings, Friday and Saturday afternoon and evenings and the once a month Sunday brunch.   The bar prices are cheap! It is an all ages club, so you can bring your children there (just not in the bar section).   This is a  Private Club , but they said guests can come Three times to experience it before signing up. Oh the dues... if you do want to join, it costs $3 a month !!! ($35 the first year), and $2 a month for following years ($25 for renewal years). What a bargain!  Yes, I ended signing my wife and I up we love it so much!", "Date": "2014-07-16", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Josh", "ReviewID": "2NhP5RqoGKdyDuYditJbjQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "This place is a really off the wall Vegas experience, an authentic German gasthaus just off Las Vegas Blvd.  Full bar and great beer on tap - at great prices.  The club is private, but you are allowed a limited number of visits without joining.    There is usually a dinner on Saturday nights (check the website for details).  The quality of the meals prepared by the members is good, and again the pricing is reasonable.  Non-members can enjoy a meal also.  Just call the club by Thursday to make a reservation.    Absolutely one of my favorite places to have a beer in Las Vegas.  Surreal atmosphere, warm and friendly people (almost none of them are German ;))) and delicious German beer on tap!  The Club itself (known as the GASCON)  is pretty neat too.  They have a couple boozy golf tournaments a year, which are a lot of fun, and also do a fantastic job hosting the Oktoberfest in DT Las Vegas.  Annual membership is like $35.  I carry my card in my wallet.    The GASCON is making a push to increase the headcount of its younger members (hold your national socialist youth movement jokes please ;))).  There's talk of using the space on the off nights as a music venue and also of hosting viewing parties for both the US and Germany games at the 2014 World Cup.  I'll be there...", "Date": "2013-12-19", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "tpefA2Br9TCKlgNfrN8Q1w", "Overall": "5", "Content": "My wife and I moved to Las Vegas about 5 years ago and were invited to the German American club.this is an interesting place. It's not a retail operation. Everything in the club is operated by member volunteers....no employees! The place operates like a real clubhouse built by the members in the 70's. It's a very friendly place and a great place to form great friendships. We wanted to meet new people and weren't afraid to join in on conversations.  The nights they are open are like events. Jazz night ,sat night dinners and entertainment, and card night etc. the bar is always open for these events and food varies from snacks,pot luck or dinner. No menus are available. pick your time to visit to get the most out of it. Their web sight has their operating schedule available for each month. After a couple visits,your hooked!! You get back what you put in. Club is more adult than child friendly although kids are always welcome. Dues are a bargain at $25 per year. If you like to socialize this is a great place for young and old.", "Date": "2016-01-09", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
