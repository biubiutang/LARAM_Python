You can order online and pick it up with no waiting as well.   The Bobbie is my favorite but I have never had something here that wasn't good.  This location is clean, friendly, and reasonably priced.  They have fountain drinks or a variety of bottled juices.", "Date": "2013-07-07", "AuthorLocation": ""}]}
