When my family and I entered this location a couple girls entered after us that apparently knew one of the workers. While we were ordering the girl working behind the counter screams, runs, knocks over equipment behind the counter slams into the door and runs out to hug and greet her friends. She stayed out of the kitchen for a few minutes one manager watched her run out and went to get a second manager. The both of them proceeded to stare at the girl as she was with her friends but no one asked her to come back in. It wasn't until she went back behind the counter that one manager told her that she knocked over some equipment and all she had to say  oh well it's just ten dollars to replace.  After this she went back into the kitchen with gloves on and ate some ice cream and without changing her gloves, started preparing food. Aside from the cashier, who was friendly and professional, the whole experience was just ridiculous and unnecessary. These people could learn some professionalism and proper work etiquette.", "Date": "2015-12-05", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Mariel", "ReviewID": "-OWiFHl3Dd5Ja0M1CfpCIw", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Food is ok, but it's a bunch of kids that are being unprofessional.

I get it! I'm yelping about a ff joint. Pathetic I know. Even I MAKE FUN OF PEOPLE FOR DOING WHAT IM ABOUT TO DO...but this ff chain is SO AWFUL I HAD too!!!!!! I hate Burger King! It's the worst fast food out there & to top it off this location is painfully slow & messed up my order. Ordered 2 different types of chicken sandwiches & a 6 PC kids nugget. Get home & they put a kids burger in my bag. I didn't want to even go in the first place. $21 later for the worst fast food ever, chicken is all breading and 1/16 of an inch of actual pressed chicken slime. Just go to Jack in the Box right down the street a mile if you MUST have ff.  Today was a must do ff for us bc of time.

It's been about a year so I thought I would give them another chance. I went last Sunday for breakfast because I like the lunch for breakfast promotion that BK has. I walked in at 9:30 and visited the bathroom first thing. When I got to the sink to wash my hands, there was no soap in the dispenser. Really? I just used the bathroom and have no soap to wash up with?        I got to the front counter and ordered A chicken sandwich and onion rings. The register lady informed me that their fryer is broken and they can't make any fries or onion rings. Great! When did it stop working? Yesterday she explained. I told her just to bring out the sandwich. She took off to go do something and I was standing there, I realized that if the fryer is down, there was zero chance that they can make a fried chicken sandwich either. When she reappeared I asked her about that and she had a deer in the headlights look. That was enough to tell me I wouldn't be getting a chicken sandwich today either. I got my money back and got out of there.       When a patron can't get soap in the bathroom just minutes after the place has opened, that tells me that the manager is not completing their opening check list correctly. Any manager worth their own salt would at least stick their head in the bathrooms to see if it is stocked before they open the restaurant.      The other major issue is that the fryer at this location was broke down on Saturday and Sunday. The weekends are the biggest sales days for restaurants. Management cannot allow the fryer to be down all weekend. You have to get someone in there to get it fixed.       There are serious management issue at this location. I've been burned twice at this location and won't be back anymore, which is a shame; because I live just two blocks away.", "Date": "2015-06-07", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Natalee", "ReviewID": "vTO8Lndvc7Rbu8tXuMWFhQ", "Overall": "2", "Content": "Needed to post something about this Burger King because of the service, not necessarily the food this time. Who do they hire at these places? Where do they find them? Don't put someone at the register that doesn't know what they're doing. The poor manager was running around like a chicken with its head cut off and the guy at the register was taking his sweet time. All I ordered was a whopper meal with cheese and ketchup only, this must have been too much to comprehend! It took 3 times asking me what I wanted before he punched it in correctly. It still didn't show right on the receipt so I told him to just change the order to Chicken Fries to be safe...I know there can't be any real chicken in those, but they're just soooo darn good!

I'm sick & tired of it.  It's the most convenient BK location for me, and obviously if I'm hitting the drive-thru it is because I'm in somewhat of a hurry, so by the time I unwrap one of my burgers & start to eat it, I'm about to get on I-15 & no time to turn around & go back to complain.   Besides, at this point, if I did go back to complain, I'd create a scene by honestly calling them incompetent (due to the frequency they mess up my order).  Last week in the drive thru, I was at the window waiting for my food when the car that was in line ahead of me stopped & the woman got out & walked back to the window -- they messed her order up.  She apologized to me, and said that they usually do mess up her order, which is why she always pulls ahead a little then stops to check her food.  Yesterday, not only did they leave cheese off the burgers that I ordered & paid for cheese on (& confirmed that cheese was listed on the electronic display when I placed the order), but they didn't even include any napkins in the bag.  Usually they give me way too many napkins.  I was really fed-up that they screwed up my order again so I was going to call the store, however they didn't include a receipt (nor did they ask if I wanted one, so I assumed they'd put one on or in the bag.   This is yet another example of their $&%# inconsistency.  Usually when they mess up, it's not including cheese that I ordered & paid for, or I'll clearly say  no tomato  & they leave ketchup off instead, or there are still tomatoes on it.  These idiots want $15 an hour?!  Sure, at times they work hard, but they don't pay attention, and they get away with it because the manager(s) & owner(s) & corporate management seem complacent.  With them charging 25 cents for a slice of American cheese, I figure they owe me about $20 by now for all the times I paid for cheese, & they left it off.  I go to other BKs occasionally & occasionally have messed-up orders, but this BK in St Rose Parkway near Henderson airport is the worst by far & even though it'll be a big inconvenience, I'll start going to a different one.", "Date": "2016-05-05", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Sandra", "ReviewID": "LTlrwJrzHF1EqZq5sHud6w", "Overall": "1", "Content": "The worst Burger King EVER in terms of service.
