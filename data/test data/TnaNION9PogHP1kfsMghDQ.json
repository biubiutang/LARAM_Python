Why can't all sandwich places be like this?! Capriotti's is simply in a different league. Sure the price is a little higher (About $8 for 9 ) and the wait a little longer, but this is due to the quality of ingredients and preparation. This spot in Town Square is fairly new and it was packed around 2 on a weekday. The seating area is limited, a few tables and a counter with bar stools facing the window.  On to the food itself...Let's begin with the bread. It is sooo soft and fresh. Just lightly toasted. It's still warm when you unwrap your sub, unlike other places that slop the meat on a cold bun and call it good. I went with the Italian Sausage sandwich with hot peppers and wow, flavor explosion! The meat is grilled to perfection and still very tender. One of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time. I'll probably be a regular here.", "Date": "2013-04-20", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Adrian", "ReviewID": "FJ05SoWQDZbspggOEW2zWQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Quick & Awesome   Ordered the  Bobby .

We were looking for something easy to pick up, stopped at cappriottis for a sandwich at townsquare. The women who was at the register was immediately rude, disrespectful towards my mom while we were just asking questions. She Insisted we couldn't order a sandwich a specific way because that's not how it was made! It's been a long day and if you don't want to work in customer service don't work in a place where your job is working with people on a regular basis. She smiled not even once, you clearly shouldn't have someone running your establishment who is the face of your company who has no personality.  Thank you for letting us experience the most rude service we've received in Las Vegas by far on this family trip, all respects to Katie.

I honestly cannot remember what was here before Capriotti's, but can we really remember many of the unmemorable, poorly thought out, and down-right bad places that have opened up at Town Square? The place seems cursed, save for Yard House. BUT I believe Capriotti's WILL survive, if only based on the fact it is a chain that delivers good food and it is a name that will have people flock to it no matter what.  I happened upon Cap's while I was shopping today and had two things in mind. 1. Getting some food and 2. Escaping the heat. I wandered to Cap's and entered. The place is tiny and cramped. There is bar seating and a few tables. No matter how busy this place gets, it is not going to hold many people, but I've noticed that about a lot of Capriotti's - small places, limited seating.  I received the Capastrami (Small) and a small fountain drink, which I had to shimmy to the back of the place to fill up. There is room for exactly one person in front of the soda machine so be prepared to wait if the place is busy.   My sandwich came out quickly and was delicious as usual. Cap's uses the finest meats and the best ingredients, that's why their sandwiches taste so good (save for a burnt Philly Cheese Steak I had once).   If I'm in Town Square and need a quick bite, this will probably now be my go-to. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is again, the tiny space and the necessity to squeeze around people to get to the soda fountain.", "Date": "2013-06-26", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Khatherine", "ReviewID": "BkHdXAYS2yDE__LCiYZ2rw", "Overall": "1", "Content": "I wouldn't come back.  This was my first time at Capriotti's and I am pretty disappointed because everyone tells me that it's the best sandwich they have ever had.. Me thinks not.  The cashier was completely ice cold towards me while I was ordering and only spoke to me wwwwwwheeeeeen: I finished ordering and gave her my card to swipe. When she handed it back and said nothing, I started walking away to sit down at a nearby table. Immediately, she raises her voice and says  HEY! YOU HAVE TO SIGN THIS FIRST!  Maybe it is because I have been in customer service for so long that something like this pisses me off, but that's not how you address customers. If it's a big deal, wait until the receipt is done printing, and THEN hand my card back at the same time saying  Will you please sign that receipt for me as well?    I ordered the Roast Beef without onion and added mayo. To my surprise, the roast beef was shredded.. I've never had it shredded before when I have ordered from other places? And the big bummer was that the roast beef was very very dry. The bread was okay, but it was on the colder side. I didn't know if I had the option for it to be toasted when I ordered or if it's served like this, but the cashier could have cared less.   After my buddy ordered, he turned to me and said  That girl was such a b%$* to me!

The turkey wasn't salty, the stuffing was tasty and had a nice texture, and the bread was really good, even though I don't usually like white bread.  There seemed to be too much cranberry (not usually a fan) but I was mistaken.  There was just enough to complement the turkey and stuffing.

It is unfortunate that the first reader did not have a good experience, because I have only had terrific experiences.

Other winners include  Slaw Be Jo  (roast beef, cole slaw, provolone, russian dressing, and mayo) and a tasty eggplant parmesan sandwich, which is one of many vegetarian choices. The only negative is that there are not a lot of places to sit, which can be a problem during the heart of the lunch rush. Service is friendly and prices run from about $6 for a small (9 ) sandwich, to $11 for a huge (20 ) sandwich which can be easily shared.

When you walk in, you can swear it's the same restaurant as not much has changed in the set up except the big board menu above the kitchen and ordering stations.    The staff is super friendly.  They seemed to be as excited as I was to be there, and I hope that time does not take away that enthusiasm because I genuinely appreciated the sincere friendliness.    I walked in at about 1pm on a Tuesday and there weren't very many people in here.  This is disturbing because I would HATE for them to suffer the same fate as Johnny Maguire's.  I'm hoping once more people realize they are here, they will come.  Build the sandwich, and they will come.   Anyway, I ordered a small (9-inch) turkey with all the fixings.  In my excitement I had forgotten to tell her I was a mall employee, but to my pleasant surprise, she made sure to ask me before finishing the transaction.  I got a small discount, which I truly appreciated.  Then I waited for my sandwich.  The employee who was making sandwiches called out a couple other people's names and then saw that I was standing there still waiting.  He asked my name, and 2 minutes later my sandwich was ready, and to my surprise, a large instead of the small I had ordered.    The best part of all of this, how freakin delicious my sandwich was!  What a pleasant experience.  I'm so excited and I hope they are here for the longrun!", "Date": "2013-04-10", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "g0hLdFYAigVbs2sABjU29Q", "Overall": "5", "Content": "Great food.

There was a wait for them to take the order but food was received quickly after ordering. The bobbie was tasty but very cold felt like the sandwich was in the freezer. The soup thought was the BLANDEST I have ever had. It literally tasted like warm milk with frozen broccoli florets in it. Not a hint of salt or pepper I couldn't even finish it. My husband said his cheese steak was good but they charge .80 for mushrooms which is odd.", "Date": "2016-12-30", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Erica", "ReviewID": "8IOMY9YfsRBYscq12bSBjQ", "Overall": "5", "Content": "My all time fave sub sandwich shop!

The crushed red peppers make the sandwich and is my favorite part.

Really fresh. I had title with cole slaw. They use fresh shredded turkey, not thin deli slices. Yum!!! Sandwiches are big too. Kids meals came with Craisans which is mice for a change. Only reason I didn't give 5's is because music was too loud to talk to each other. We had a hard time ordering because we couldn't hear the girl.", "Date": "2015-07-11", "AuthorLocation": ""},{"Author": "Lucas", "ReviewID": "5FyxM_o2GTaJGNw8rE2IMA", "Overall": "4", "Content": "On point with other Capriottis shops in las vegas.
